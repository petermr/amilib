# SUMMARY Of IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter05 : Global Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles and Feedbacks

## Summary

The significant rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) since the pre-industrial era is attributed to human activities. These increases are driven by anthropogenic emissions, removals, and interactions within land and ocean biogeochemical cycles. This chapter examines the impact of carbon and nitrogen cycles on GHG levels, related phenomena like ocean acidification and deoxygenation, and identifies feedback mechanisms influencing future GHG accumulation and climate change. It also assesses the carbon budget necessary to meet global warming targets and the broad effects of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation modification (SRM) on biogeochemical cycles.

### Human Impact on Carbon and Biogeochemical Cycles

Since 1750, CO2, CH4, and N2O levels have surged by approximately 47%, 156%, and 23%, respectively. These levels are unprecedented in the past 800,000 years. Current CO2 concentrations are the highest in 2 million years, with a rate of increase since 1900 much faster than any period in the past 800,000 years. Human activities are the primary drivers, with fossil fuel CO2 emissions accounting for 81-91% of total emissions from 2010-2019.

### Contemporary Trends of Greenhouse Gases

The past decade has recorded the highest levels of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in history. CO2 emissions are partitioned among the atmosphere (46%), ocean (23%), and terrestrial ecosystems (31%). The stable atmospheric fraction at 44% over six decades, alongside growing ocean and land sinks, highlights changes in ocean carbon processes indicating a potential future weakening of the ocean sink under high-emissions scenarios.

### Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation

Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO2 uptake, is decreasing pH levels and impacting marine organisms; calcium carbonate structures, with worsening projections under high-emissions scenarios. Ocean deoxygenation, linked to warming and reduced ventilation, is expected to escalate, significantly affecting marine life and biogeochemical cycles.

### Future Projections of Carbon Feedbacks on Climate Change

Both oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks will continue to grow with rising CO2 levels but will capture a declining fraction of emissions over time. Future projections, dependent on emission scenarios, face uncertainties in carbon cycle feedback magnitudes and timing. Thawing permafrost and changing land and ocean sinks could release more carbon, complicating stabilization efforts for atmospheric CO2 levels.

### Remaining Carbon Budgets to Climate Stabilization

Limiting global warming requires achieving net-zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The transient climate response to cumulative emissions of CO2 (TCRE) suggests a likely warming range of 1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 PgC emissions. Remaining carbon budgets to limit warming to 1.5°C, 1.7°C, or 2.0°C are 140, 230, and 370 PgC, respectively, factoring in non-CO2 emissions and other adjustments. Significant CO2 emission reductions are crucial to meet these targets.

### Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Modification

Land- and ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods have the potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, but the benefits of this removal would be partially offset by CO2 release from land and ocean carbon stores. CDR methods can sequester CO2 but may be counteracted by CO2 release from existing carbon stores. The effectiveness of CDR decreases with increased removal and lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Both CDR and SRM have extensive side effects, including changes in albedo, water cycles, and marine productivity. SRM, while potentially enhancing carbon sinks, does not address ocean acidification and may have profound ecological and social impacts.
