# amilib

Library to support downloading and analysis of documents, mainly from Open Access repositories, from 
published scholarly articles, or from authoritative sites such as UN IPCC or UNFCCC. The current version 2024-12-01 includes entry points but the longer term plan is to integrate with [docanalysis](https://github.com/petermr/docanalysis) and [pygetpapers](https://github.com/petermr/pygetpapers). That will give a onestop toolset for downloading Open Access articles/reports in bulk, making them semantic , and analysing them with NLP and AI/ML methods.
