<p><strong>1.5&#176;C warmer worlds </strong><em>Projected </em>worlds in which <em>global warming</em> has reached and, unless otherwise indicated, been limited to 1.5&#176;C above <em>pre-industria</em><em>l </em> levels. There is no single 1.5&#176;C warmer world, and <em>projections </em>of 1.5&#176;C warmer worlds look different depending on whether it is considered on a near-term transient trajectory or at climate equilibrium after several millennia, and, in both cases, if it occurs with or without <em>overshoot</em>. Within the 21st century, several aspects play a role for the assessment of risk and potential <em>impacts </em>in 1.5&#176;C warmer worlds: the possible occurrence, magnitude and duration of an overshoot; the way in which emissions reductions are achieved; the ways in which policies might be able to influence the <em>resilience </em>of human and natural systems; and the nature of the regional and sub-regional risks. Beyond the 21st century, several elements of the <em>climate system </em>would continue to change even if the global mean temperatures remain stable, including further increases of sea level.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptability of policy or system change</strong></p>
<p>The extent to which a policy or system change is evaluated unfavourably or favourably, or rejected or supported, by members of the general public (public acceptability) or politicians or governments (political acceptability). Acceptability may vary from totally unacceptable/fully rejected to totally acceptable/fully supported; individuals may differ in how acceptable policies or system changes are believed to be.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptability </strong></p>
<p>See <em>Adaptive capacity</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation</strong></p>
<p>In <em>human systems</em>, the process of adjustment to actual or expected <em>climate</em> and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to&#160;actual&#160;climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate&#160;and its effects.</p>
<p><em>Incremental adaptation</em></p>
<p>Adaptation that maintains the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale. In some cases, incremental adaptation can accrue to result in <em>transformational adaptation</em> (Termeer et al., 2017; T&#224;bara et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r2" class="bf-reference" data-ref="2"><a href="#fn:r2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Transformational adaptation</em></p>
<p>Adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a <em>socio-ecological system</em> in anticipation of <em>climate change</em> and its <em>impacts</em>.</p>
<p><em>Adaptation limits </em></p>
<p>The point at which an actor&#8217;s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard adaptation limit: No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks.</li>
<li>Soft adaptation limit: Options are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.</li>

<p><strong>Adaptation options</strong></p>
<p>The array of strategies and measures that are available and appropriate for addressing <em>adaptation</em>. They include a wide range of actions that can be categorized as structural, <em>institutional</em>, ecological or behavioural.

<p><strong>Adaptive capacity</strong></p>
<p>The ability of systems, <em>institutions</em>, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences.

<p><strong>Aerosol</strong></p>
<p>A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 &#956;m that reside in the <em>atmosphere</em> for at least several hours. The term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or <em>anthropogenic</em> origin. Aerosols may influence <em>climate</em> in several ways: through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces thereby altering their <em>albedo</em> and contributing to <em>climate feedback</em>. Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate from two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter (PM), and formation of secondary PM from gaseous <em>precursors</em>. The bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt, organic carbon, <em>black carbon (BC),</em> mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium. These labels are, however, imperfect as aerosols combine particles to create complex mixtures. See also<em> Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF)</em> and <em>Black carbon (BC)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Afforestation</strong></p>
<p>Planting of new <em>forests</em> on lands that historically have not contained forests. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, <em>reforestation</em> and <em>deforestation</em>, see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000)<sup id="fnref:r4" class="bf-reference" data-ref="4"><a href="#fn:r4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, information provided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2013)<sup id="fnref:r5" class="bf-reference" data-ref="5"><a href="#fn:r5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and the report on Definitions and Methodological Options to Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests and Devegetation of Other Vegetation Types (IPCC, 2003)<sup id="fnref:r6" class="bf-reference" data-ref="6"><a href="#fn:r6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.

<p>In this report, the degree of agreement within the scientific body of knowledge on a particular finding is assessed based on multiple lines of <em>evidence</em> (e.g., mechanistic understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgement) and expressed qualitatively (Mastrandrea et al., 2010)<sup id="fnref:r7" class="bf-reference" data-ref="7"><a href="#fn:r7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. See also <em>Evidence</em>, <em>Confidence</em>, <em>Likelihood</em> and <em>Uncertainty</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Air pollution</strong></p>
<p>Degradation of air quality with negative effects on human health or the natural or built environment due to the introduction, by natural processes or human activity, into the <em>atmosphere</em> of substances (gases, <em>aerosols</em>) which have a direct (primary pollutants) or indirect (secondary pollutants) harmful effect. See also<em> Aerosol</em> and <em>Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Albedo</strong></p>
<p>The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object, often expressed as a percentage. Snow-covered surfaces have a high albedo, the surface albedo of soils ranges from high to low, and vegetation-covered surfaces and the oceans have a low albedo. The Earth&#8217;s planetary albedo changes mainly through varying cloudiness and changes in snow, ice, leaf area and land cover.</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly</strong></p>
<p>The deviation of a variable from its value averaged over a <em>reference period</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropocene</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;Anthropocene&#8217; is a proposed new geological epoch resulting from significant human-driven changes to the structure and functioning of the Earth System, including the <em>climate system</em>. Originally proposed in the Earth System science community in 2000, the proposed new epoch is undergoing a formalization process within the geological community based on the stratigraphic <em>evidence</em> that human activities have changed the Earth System to the extent of forming geological deposits with a signature that is distinct from those of the <em>Holocene</em>, and which will remain in the geological record. Both the stratigraphic and Earth System approaches to defining the Anthropocene consider the mid-20th Century to be the most appropriate starting date, although others have been proposed and continue to be discussed. The Anthropocene concept has been taken up by a diversity of disciplines and the public to denote the substantive influence humans have had on the state, dynamics and future of the Earth System. See also <em>Holocene</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropogenic </strong></p>
<p>Resulting from or produced by human activities. See also <em>Anthropogenic emissions</em> and <em>Anthropogenic removals</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropogenic emissions </strong></p>
<p>Emissions of <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em>, <em>precursors</em> of GHGs and <em>aerosols</em> caused by human activities. These activities include the burning of <em>fossil fuels</em>, <em>deforestation</em>, <em>land use</em> and <em>land-use changes</em> (LULUC), livestock production, fertilisation, waste management and industrial processes. See also <em>Anthropogenic</em> and <em>Anthropogenic removals</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropogenic removals </strong></p>
<p>Anthropogenic removals refer to the withdrawal of <em>GHGs</em> from the <em>atmosphere</em> as a result of deliberate human activities. These include enhancing biological <em>sinks</em> of <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> and using chemical engineering to achieve long-term removal and storage. <em>Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</em> from industrial and energy-related sources, which alone does not remove CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, can reduce atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> if it is combined with <em>bioenergy</em> production (<em>BECCS</em>). See also <em>Anthropogenic emissions</em>,<em> Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)</em> and <em>Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong></p>
<p>The gaseous envelope surrounding the earth, divided into five layers &#8211; the <em>troposphere</em> which contains half of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, the <em>stratosphere</em>, the mesosphere, the thermosphere, and the exosphere, which is the outer limit of the atmosphere. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93 % volume mixing ratio), helium and radiatively active <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em> such as <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> (0.04% volume mixing ratio) and <em>ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</em>. In addition, the atmosphere contains the GHG water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), whose amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and <em>aerosols</em>. See also <em>Troposphere</em>,<em> Stratosphere</em>,<em> Greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> and <em>Hydrological cycle</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Baseline scenario</strong></p>
<p>In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term business-as-usual (BAU) <em>scenario</em>, although the term BAU has fallen out of favour because the idea of business as usual in century-long socio-economic <em>projections</em> is hard to fathom. In the context of <em>transformation pathways</em>, the term baseline scenarios refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation <em>policies</em> or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to <em>mitigation scenarios</em> that are constructed to meet different goals for <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term baseline scenario is often used interchangeably with reference scenario and no policy scenario. See also <em>Emission scenario</em> and <em>Mitigation scenario</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Black carbon (BC)</strong></p>
<p>Operationally defined <em>aerosol</em> species based on measurement of light absorption and chemical reactivity and/or thermal stability. It is sometimes referred to as soot. BC is mostly formed by the incomplete combustion of <em>fossil fuels</em>, <em>biofuels</em> and <em>biomass</em> but it also occurs naturally. It stays in the <em>atmosphere</em> only for days or weeks. It is the most strongly light-absorbing component of particulate matter (PM) and has a warming effect by absorbing heat into the atmosphere and reducing the <em>albedo</em> when deposited on snow or ice. See also <em>Aerosol</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Blue carbon </strong></p>
<p>Blue carbon is the carbon captured by living organisms in coastal (e.g., mangroves, salt marshes, seagrasses) and marine <em>ecosystems</em>, and stored in <em>biomass</em> and sediments.</p>
<p><strong>Burden sharing (also referred to as Effort sharing) </strong></p>
<p>In the context of <em>mitigation</em>, burden sharing refers to sharing the effort of reducing the sources or enhancing the <em>sinks</em> of <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em> from historical or <em>projected</em> levels, usually allocated by some criteria, as well as sharing the cost burden across countries.</p>

<p>See <em>Baseline scenario</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon budget </strong></p>
<p>This term refers to three concepts in the literature: (1) an assessment of <em>carbon cycle</em> sources and <em>sinks</em> on a global level, through the synthesis of <em>evidence</em> for <em>fossil fuel</em> and cement emissions, <em>land-use change</em> emissions, ocean and land <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> sinks, and the resulting atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> growth rate. This is referred to as the global carbon budget; (2) the estimated cumulative amount of global carbon dioxide emissions that that is estimated to limit global surface temperature to a given level above a <em>reference period</em>, taking into account global surface temperature contributions of other <em>GHGs</em> and climate forcers; (3) the distribution of the carbon budget defined under (2) to the regional, national, or sub-national level based on considerations of <em>equity</em>, costs or efficiency. See also <em>Remaining carbon budget</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon cycle</strong></p>
<p>The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em>, carbon in <em>biomass</em>, and carbon dissolved in the ocean as carbonate and bicarbonate) through the <em>atmosphere</em>, hydrosphere, terrestrial and marine biosphere and lithosphere. In this report, the reference unit for the global carbon cycle is GtCO<sub>2</sub> or GtC (Gigatonne of carbon = 1 GtC = 10<sup>15</sup> grams of carbon. This corresponds to 3.667 GtCO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</strong></p>
<p>A naturally occurring gas, CO<sub>2</sub> is also a by-product of burning <em>fossil fuels</em> (such as oil, gas and coal), of burning <em>biomass</em>, of <em>land-use changes (LUC)</em> and of industrial processes (e.g., cement production). It is the principal <em>anthropogenic</em> greenhouse gas (<em>GHG</em>) that affects the Earth&#8217;s radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other GHGs are measured and therefore has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1. See also <em>Greenhouse gas (GHG)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)</strong></p>
<p>A process in which a relatively pure stream of <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> from industrial and energy-related sources is separated (captured), conditioned, compressed and transported to a storage location for long-term isolation from the <em>atmosphere</em>. Sometimes referred to as Carbon capture and storage. See also <em>Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU)</em>,<em> Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)</em> and <em>Uptake</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU) </strong></p>
<p>A process in which <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> is captured and then used to produce a new product. If the CO<sub>2</sub> is stored in a product for a <em>climate</em>-relevant time horizon, this is referred to as carbon dioxide capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Only then, and only combined with CO<sub>2</sub> recently removed from the <em>atmosphere</em>, can CCUS lead to <em>carbon dioxide removal</em>. CCU is sometimes referred to as carbon dioxide capture and use. See also <em>Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)</em>.</p>

<p>See <em>Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) </strong></p>
<p><em>Anthropogenic</em> activities removing <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> from the <em>atmosphere</em> and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic enhancement of biological or geochemical sinks and direct air capture and storage, but excludes natural CO<sub>2</sub> <em>uptake</em> not directly caused by human activities. See also <em>Mitigation (of climate change)</em>, <em>Greenhouse gas removal (GGR)</em>, <em>Negative emissions</em>, <em>Direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage (DACCS)</em> and <em>Sink</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon intensity</strong></p>

<p><strong>Carbon neutrality </strong></p>
<p>See <em>Net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon price </strong></p>
<p>The price for avoided or released <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> or <em>CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions</em>. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax, or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of <em>mitigation</em>, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation <em>policies</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon sequestration</strong></p>
<p>The process of storing carbon in a carbon pool. See also <em>Blue carbon</em>, <em>Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)</em>, <em>Uptake</em> and <em>Sink</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)</strong></p>
<p>A mechanism defined under Article 12 of the <em>Kyoto Protocol</em> through which investors (governments or companies) from developed (Annex B) countries may finance <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emission reduction or removal projects in developing countries (Non-Annex B), and receive Certified Emission Reduction Units (CERs) for doing so. The CERs can be credited towards the commitments of the respective developed countries. The CDM is intended to facilitate the two objectives of promoting <em>sustainable development (SD)</em> in developing countries and of helping <em>industrialised countries</em> to reach their emissions commitments in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p><strong>Climate</strong></p>
<p>Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the <em>climate system</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change</strong></p>
<p>Climate change refers to a change in the state of the <em>climate</em> that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external <em>forcings</em> such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent <em>anthropogenic</em> changes in the composition of the <em>atmosphere</em> or in <em>land use</em>. Note that the <em>Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</em>, in its Article 1, defines climate change as: &#8216;a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.&#8217; The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes. See also <em>Climate variability</em>, <em>Global warming</em>, <em>Ocean acidification (OA)</em> and <em>Detection and attribution</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change commitment </strong></p>
<p>Climate change commitment is defined as the unavoidable future <em>climate change</em> resulting from inertia in the geophysical and socio-economic systems. Different types of climate change commitment are discussed in the literature (see subterms). Climate change commitment is usually quantified in terms of the further change in temperature, but it includes other future changes, for example in the <em>hydrological cycle</em>, in <em>extreme weather events</em>, in extreme climate events, and in sea level.</p>
<p><em>Constant composition commitment </em></p>
<p>The constant composition commitment is the remaining <em>climate change</em> that would result if atmospheric composition, and hence <em>radiative forcing</em>, were held fixed at a given value. It results from the thermal inertia of the ocean and slow processes in the cryosphere and land surface.</p>
<p><em>Constant emissions commitment </em></p>
<p>The constant emissions commitment is the committed <em>climate change</em> that would result from keeping <em>anthropogenic emissions</em> constant.</p>
<p><em>Zero emissions commitment </em></p>
<p>The zero emissions commitment is the climate change commitment that would result from setting <em>anthropogenic emissions</em> to zero. It is determined by both inertia in physical <em>climate system</em> components (ocean, cryosphere, land surface) and <em>carbon cycle</em> inertia.</p>
<p><em>Feasible scenario commitment </em></p>
<p>The feasible scenario commitment is the <em>climate change</em> that corresponds to the lowest <em>emission scenario</em> judged feasible.</p>
<p><em>Infrastructure commitment</em></p>
<p>The infrastructure commitment is the <em>climate change</em> that would result if existing <em>greenhouse gas</em> and <em>aerosol</em> emitting infrastructure were used until the end of its expected lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Climate-compatible development (CCD)</strong></p>
<p>A form of development building on climate strategies that embrace development goals and development strategies that integrate climate <em>risk management</em>, <em>adaptation</em> and <em>mitigation</em>.

<p><strong>Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) </strong></p>
<p>The occurrence of a value of a weather or <em>climate</em> variable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed values of the variable. For simplicity, both <em>extreme weather events</em> and extreme climate events are referred to collectively as &#8216;climate extremes&#8217;. See also <em>Extreme weather event</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Climate feedback </strong></p>
<p>An interaction in which a perturbation in one <em>climate</em> quantity causes a change in a second and the change in the second quantity ultimately leads to an additional change in the first. A negative feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is weakened by the changes it causes; a positive feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is enhanced. The initial perturbation can either be externally forced or arise as part of internal variability.</p>

<p><strong>Climate model</strong></p>
<p>A numerical representation of the <em>climate system</em> based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and <em>feedback</em> processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved. There is an evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry and biology. <em>Climate models</em> are applied as a research tool to study and simulate the <em>climate</em> and for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions. See also <em>Earth system model (ESM)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Climate neutrality </strong></p>
<p>Concept of a state in which human activities result in no net effect on the <em>climate system</em>. Achieving such a state would require balancing of residual emissions with emission <em>(carbon dioxide) </em>removal as well as accounting for regional or local biogeophysical effects of human activities that, for example, affect surface <em>albedo</em> or local <em>climate</em>. See also <em>Net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Climate projection</strong></p>
<p>A climate <em>projection</em> is the simulated response of the <em>climate system</em> to a <em>scenario</em> of future emission or concentration of <em>greenhouse gases (GHGs)</em> and <em>aerosols</em>, generally derived using <em>climate models</em>. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/<em>radiative forcing</em> scenario used, which is in turn based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.</p>
<p><strong>Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) </strong></p>
<p>Trajectories that strengthen <em>sustainable development</em> and efforts to eradicate <em>poverty</em> and reduce <em>inequalities</em> while promoting <em>fair</em> and cross-scalar <em>adaptation</em> to and <em>resilience</em> in a changing <em>climate</em>. They raise the <em>ethics</em>, <em>equity</em> and <em>feasibility</em> aspects of the deep <em>societal transformation</em> needed to drastically reduce emissions to limit <em>global warming</em> (e.g., to 1.5&#176;C) and achieve desirable and liveable futures and <em>well-being</em> for all.</p>

<p><strong>Climate sensitivity</strong></p>
<p>Climate sensitivity refers to the change in the annual <em>global mean surface temperature</em> in response to a change in the atmospheric <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> concentration or other <em>radiative forcing</em>.</p>
<p><em>Equilibrium climate sensitivity</em></p>
<p>Refers to the equilibrium (steady state) change in the annual <em>global mean surface temperature</em> following a doubling of the atmospheric <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> concentration. As a true equilibrium is challenging to define in <em>climate models</em> with dynamic oceans, the equilibrium climate sensitivity is often estimated through experiments in AOGCMs where CO<sub>2</sub> levels are either quadrupled or doubled from <em>pre-industrial</em> levels and which are integrated for 100-200 years. The climate sensitivity parameter (units: &#176;C (W m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>)<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) refers to the equilibrium change in the annual global mean surface temperature following a unit change in <em>radiative forcing</em>.</p>
<p><em>Effective climate sensitivity</em></p>
<p>An estimate of the <em>global mean surface temperature</em> response to a doubling of the atmospheric <em>carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> concentration that is evaluated from model output or observations for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the <em>climate feedbacks</em> at a particular time and may vary with <em>forcing</em> history and <em>climate</em> state, and therefore may differ from <em>equilibrium climate sensitivity</em>.</p>
<p><em>Transient climate response</em></p>
<p>The change in the <em>global mean surface temperature</em>, averaged over a 20-year period, centered at the time of atmospheric <em>CO<sub>2</sub></em> doubling, in a <em>climate model</em> simulation in which CO<sub>2</sub> increases at 1% yr<sup>-1</sup> from <em>pre-industrial</em>. It is a measure of the strength of <em>climate feedbacks</em> and the timescale of ocean heat uptake.</p>
<p><strong>Climate services</strong></p>
<p>Climate services refers to information and products that enhance users&#8217; knowledge and understanding about the <em>impacts</em> of <em>climate change</em> and/or <em>climate variability</em> so as to aid decision-making of individuals and organizations and enable preparedness and early climate change action. Products can include climate data products.</p>
<p><strong>Climate-smart agriculture (CSA)</strong></p>
<p>Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively support development and ensure <em>food security</em> in a changing <em>climate</em>. CSA aims to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, <em>adapting</em> and building <em>resilience</em> to <em>climate change</em>, and reducing and/or removing <em>greenhouse gas</em> emissions, where possible (FAO, 2018)<sup id="fnref:r11" class="bf-reference" data-ref="11"><a href="#fn:r11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>.</p>
