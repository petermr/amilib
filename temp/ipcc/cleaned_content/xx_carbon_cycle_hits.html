Cities and built environments can play an additional role. For example, more compact designs and higher accessibility reduce travel demand and translate into lower average floor space and corresponding heating/cooling and lighting demand, and thus reductions of between 5% to 20% of GHG emissions of end-use sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Creutzig--2021b">Creutzig et al. 2021b</a>). Avoidance of food loss and wastage &#8211; which equalled 8&#8211;10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2010&#8211;2016 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mbow--2019">Mbow et al. 2019</a>), while millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition &#8211; is a prime example (Chapter 12). A key challenge in meeting global nutrition services is therefore to avoid food loss and waste while simultaneously raising nutrition levels to equitable standards globally. Literature results indicate that in developed economies, consumers are the largest source of food waste, and that behavioural changes such as meal planning, use of leftovers, and avoidance of over-preparation can be important service-oriented solutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gunders--2017">Gunders et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schanes--2018">Schanes et al. 2018</a>), while improvements to expiration labels by regulators would reduce unnecessary disposal of unexpired items (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2017">Wilson et al. 2017</a>) and improved preservation in supply chains would reduce spoilage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Duncan--2019">Duncan and Gulbahar 2019</a>).

Demand-side measures lead to changes in consumption of land-based resources and can save GHG emissions by reducing or improving management of residues or making land areas available for other uses such as afforestation or bioenergy production (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2013">Smith et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019">Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019</a>). Deforestation is the second-largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, caused mainly by expanding forestry and agriculture, and in many cases this agricultural expansion is driven by trade demand for food. For example, across the tropics, cattle and oilseed products account for half the deforestation carbon emissions, embodied in international trade to China and Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Creutzig--2019a">Creutzig et al. 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pendrill--2019">Pendrill et al. 2019</a>).

Arguably, demand-side interventions often operate institutionally or in terms of restoring natural functioning and have so far been politically sidelined but COVID-19 revealed interesting perspectives (Box 5.2).
