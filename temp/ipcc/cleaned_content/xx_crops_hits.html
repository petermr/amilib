Table 5.3a lists how often different choice-architecture tools were used in many countries over the past 10 years to change ASI behaviours, and how often each tool was used to enhance an economic incentive. These tools have been tested mostly in developed countries. Reduction in energy use (typically electricity consumption) is the most widely studied behaviour (because metering is easily observable). All but one tool was applied to increase this &#8216;Avoid&#8217; behaviour, with demand-side reductions from 0% to up to 20%, with most values below 3% (see also meta-analyses by <a class="reference-link" href="#Hummel--2019">Hummel and Maedche (2019)</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nisa--2019">Nisa et al.

As attention to energy efficiency in Europe increased in the 1990s, policymakers attempted to stimulate energy-saving lamp diffusion through voluntary measures. But policies stimulated only limited adoption. Consumers perceived compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) as giving &#8216;cold&#8217; light, being unattractively shaped, taking too long to achieve full brightness, unsuitable for many fixtures, and unreliable (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wall--2009">Wall and Crosbie 2009</a>). Still, innovations by major CFL and LED multinationals continued. Increasing political attention to climate change and criticisms from environmental NGOs (e.g. WWF, Greenpeace) strengthened awareness about the inefficiency of incandescent light bulbs (ILBs), which led to negative socio-cultural framings that associated ILBs with energy waste (<a class="reference-link" href="#Franceschini--2016">Franceschini and Alkemade 2016</a>). The combined pressures from the lighting industry, NGOs and member states led the European Commission to introduce the 2009 ban of ILBs of more than 80W, progressing to lower-wattage bans in successive years. While the ILB ban initially mainly boosted CFL diffusion, it also stimulated LED uptake. LED prices decreased quickly by more than 85% between 2008 and 2012 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sanderson--2014">Sanderson and Simons 2014</a>), because of scale economies, standardisation and commoditisation of LED chip technology, and improved manufacturing techniques.

A no-climate-policy scenario assumes that no future climate policies are implemented, beyond what is in the model calibration, effectively implying that the carbon price is zero. No-climate-policy reference scenarios have a broad range depending on socio-economic assumptions and model characteristics, and consequently are important when assessing mitigation costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Riahi--2017">Riahi et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018">Rogelj et al. 2018</a> b).

Mitigation pathways are often developed to meet a predefined level of climate change, often referred to as a backcast. There are relatively few IAMs that include an endogenous climate model or emulator due to the added computational complexity, though exceptions do exist. In practice, models implement climate constraints by either iterating carbon-price assumptions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Strefler--2021b">Strefler et al. 2021b</a>) or by adopting an associated carbon budget (<a class="reference-link" href="#Riahi--2021">Riahi et al. 2021</a>).

The policy categories were identified using text pattern matching on the scenario metadata and calibrated on the best-known scenarios from model intercomparisons, with further validation against the related literature, reported emission and carbon price trajectories, and exchanges with modellers. If the information available is enough to qualify a policy category number but not sufficient for a subcategory, then only the number is retained (e.g., P2 instead of P2a/b/c). A suffix added after P0 further qualifies a diagnostic scenario as one of the other policy categories. To demonstrate the diversity of the scenarios, the vetted scenarios were classified into different categories along the dimensions of population, GDP, energy, and cumulative emissions (Figure 3.4). The number of scenarios in each category provides some insight into the current literature, but this does not indicate a higher probability of that category occurring in reality. For population, the majority of scenarios are consistent with the SSP2 &#8216;middle of the road&#8217; category, with very few scenarios exploring the outer extremes. GDP has a slightly larger variation, but overall most scenarios are around the SSP2 socio-economic assumptions. The level of CCS and CDR is expected to change depending on the extent of mitigation, but there remains extensive use of both CDR and CCS in scenarios. CDR is dominated by bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and sequestration on land, with relatively few scenarios using direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) and even less with enhanced weathering (EW) and other technologies (not shown). In terms of energy consumption, final energy has a much smaller range than primary energy as conversion losses are not included in final energy. Both mitigation and reference scenarios are shown, so there is a broad spread in different energy carriers represented in the database. Bioenergy has a number of scenarios at around 100 EJ, representing a constraint used in many model intercomparisons.</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter03/html_with_ids.html#box-3.2_p1">temp/ipcc/Chapter03/html_with_ids.html#box-3.2_p1</a></td><td><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_&#8226;-Box-body" lang="en-GB" id="box-3.2_p1">The reduction in CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was estimated to be about 6% (Section 4.2.2.4 and Table 4.SM.2) lower than 2019 levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Forster--2020">Forster et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Friedlingstein--2020">Friedlingstein et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2020c">Liu et al. 2020c</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#BP--2021">BP 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Crippa--2021">Crippa et al. 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2021">IEA 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Le%20Qu%C3%A9r%C3%A9--2021">Le Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2021</a>).

The longer-term effects are uncertain but so far do not indicate a clear structural change for climate policy related to the pandemic. The increase in renewable shares in 2020 could stimulate a further transition, but slow economic growth can also slow down (renewable) energy investments. Also, lifestyle changes during the crisis can still develop in different directions (working from home, but maybe also living further away from work). Without a major intervention, most long-term scenarios project that emissions will start to follow a similar pathway as earlier projections (although at a reduced level) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020b">IEA 2020b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kikstra--2021a">Kikstra et al. 2021a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rochedo--2021">Rochedo et al. 2021</a>).

Most studies suggest a noticeable reduction in 2030 emissions. However, much further reductions would be needed to reach the emission levels consistent with mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 2&#176;C (&gt;67%) or lower (see Chapter 4). At the moment, the share of investments in greenhouse gas reduction is relatively small in most recovery packages, and no structural shifts for climate policies are observed linked to the pandemic. Finally, most of the scenarios analysed in this Chapter do not include the 2020 emissions reduction related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on the pathways will likely be very small. The assessment of climate mitigation pathways in this chapter should be interpreted as being almost exclusively based on the assumption of a fast recovery with limited persistent effects on emissions or structural changes.</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter03/html_with_ids.html#3.3.3_p2">temp/ipcc/Chapter03/html_with_ids.html#3.3.3_p2</a></td><td><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB" id="3.3.3_p2">Climate change can impact the potential for AFOLU mitigation action by altering terrestrial carbon uptake, crop yields and bioenergy potential (Chapter 7).

It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the distributional effects of carbon pricing, it is not sufficient to consider vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at different incomes levels but also horizontal redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at similar incomes which is due to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel consumption). Compared to vertical redistribution, it is more difficult to devise policies that effectively address horizontal redistribution (Cronin et al. 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pizer--2019">Pizer and Sexton 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Douenne--2020">Douenne 2020</a>).

Investments in public transportation may reduce horizontal redistribution if it makes it easier for households to reduce fossil fuel consumption when prices increase (see Sections 4.4.1.5 and 4.4.1.9). Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Charlier--2019">Charlier et al. 2019</a>).

Precisely, IMP1.5-SP (Shifting Pathways) and 1.5-Ren (Renewables) lead to the same long-term temperature, but differ in underlying socio-economic conditions. The former is based on Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 1 (sustainable development), whereas the latter is based on SSP2 (middle of the road). Comparing 1.5-Ren to 1.5-SP can thus be interpreted as a numerical translation of trying the reach the same long-term temperature goal without and with shifting development pathways towards sustainability. Data shows that the global price of carbon necessary to remain on target is 40&#8211;50% lower in the latter relative to the former, thus indicating that mitigation is cheaper with a shift in development pathway towards sustainability.

Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, equivalent to the elimination of negative carbon prices, have been more successful when they have included complementary and transparent measures that enjoy popular support, accompanied by a strong communications component that explains the measures and stresses their benefits (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rentschler--2017">Rentschler and Bazilian 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maestre-Andr%C3%A9s--2019">Maestre-Andr&#233;s et al. 2019</a>).</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.8_p7">temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.8_p7</a></td><td><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB" id="4.4.1.8_p7">Part of the losses (and related calls for compensation or exemptions) due to carbon pricing are related to the fact that it hurts the competitiveness of sectors that face imports from countries with lower carbon prices, leading to &#8216;carbon leakage&#8217; if carbon-intensive production (and related jobs) migrates from countries with relatively high carbon prices. Some research suggests that evidence that a border carbon tax (or adjustment), set on the basis of the carbon content of the import, including a downward adjustment on the basis of any carbon payments (taxes or other) already made before entry, could reduce carbon leakage while also raising additional revenue and encouraging carbon pricing in the exporting country (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cosbey--2019">Cosbey et al. 2019</a>).</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.8_p8">temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.8_p8</a></td><td><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB" id="4.4.1.8_p8">The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), as well as momentum from climate actions by other countries and international climate agreements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karapin--2016">Karapin 2016</a>; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rentschler--2017">Rentschler and Bazilian 2017</a>). In countries that export carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers.</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.8_p10">temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.8_p10</a></td><td><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB" id="4.4.1.8_p10">In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and may not be sufficient to address the other objectives pursued. Even if the carbon price is high, the revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are eliminated. For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Jakob--2016">Jakob et al. (2016)</a> find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet a small part of their infrastructure spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak of 0.93% in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric tonne of CO<span class="&#8226;-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">2</span>, to 0.48% in 2018, when the rate had reached USD132 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jonsson--2020">Jonsson et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Statistics%20Sweden--2020">Statistics Sweden 2020</a>). This means that governments that want to avoid a decline in the GDP share for total tax revenues over time would have to raise the intake from other taxes. However, it is here important to note that domestic tax hikes are likely to involve trade-offs since, at the same time as the spending they fund may provide various benefits, they may also reduce the capacity of households and the private sector to consume and invest, something that may reduce growth over time and reduced resources for spending in support of human development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lofgren--2013">Lofgren et al. 2013</a>). It is also worth emphasising that restructuring of the fiscal system amount to changes in the social contract of the society (<a class="reference-link" href="#Combet--2017">Combet and Hourcade 2017</a> and 2014), and thus represents a major economic and social decision.</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.9_p2">temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.1.9_p2</a></td><td><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB" id="4.4.1.9_p2">Exclusionary mechanisms such as decreasing accessibility and affordability of inner-urban neighbourhoods is a major cause of suburbanisation of low- to middle-income households (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Hochstenbach--2018">Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018</a>).

Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs (e.g., households feeling helpless in front of rising fuel prices) and the economic costs of mitigation policies &#8211; as a lower price of carbon is likely to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust.</p></td></tr><tr><td>rice</td><td><a href="temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.3.1_p1">temp/ipcc/Chapter04/html_with_ids.html#4.4.3.1_p1</a></td><td><p class="Body-copy_&#8226;-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB" id="4.4.3.1_p1">The international context is a major source of uncertainty for national-level planning, especially for small- or medium-sized open economies, because the outcome of domestic choices may significantly depend on decisions made by other countries and actor, over which national governments have limited or no control (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lachapelle--2013">Lachapelle and Paterson 2013</a>).
