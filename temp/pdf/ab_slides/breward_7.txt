Climate Change
What to think and what to do
7. What to do (group)
We don’t inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.
Climate Change –What to think and What to do –Alastair Breward –Autumn 2023 –U3AC –Seminar 7

page ============ 1 ==========
What to do (group)
Why bother? (Refresher)
• Because even in aggregate, private PCF actions won’t be enough, or fast enough
• Because our institutions won’t do it unless we
• Push them into acting, and
• Force them to reform, OR
• Burn them down and build different ones
• We need to change public attitudes, and hence politicians, and hence (among many
other things) incentives on businesses.
• Age is no barrier (the Young and the Old are the most active age groups)
• In fact being older positively helps – we have more
• Money
• Time
• Influence/networks
• And perhaps also Wisdom (to fix the mistakes we made on the way)

What to do (group)
Why bother? – Because it is our duty
• On a lecture to school children in 2022: “I sensed ..a general muttering in the auditorium full of 16–17-year-olds,
that .. never really went away. I thought they might be bored by the specifics I was talking about - sources of
emissions etc. … I raced through the topics, hoping to reach one they would be interested in. And at the end,
during the Q&A, it finally came out.
• ‘Why are you here talking to us? We can’t do anything. Only politicians, only business leaders, can make the big changes
you are talking about. Why aren’t you talking to them?’
• ‘Why do you talk to us about possible actions, when we all know that none of that will happen?’
• ‘All these people in power have known about this problem for so long. Yet the IPCC comes out with report after report
explaining we have to act within just a few years — and nothing happens, nothing changes. Why do you think this talk of
yours to us can do anything?’
• “I realised that times had shifted, and that the 16-year-olds of today were in a place far beyond where those of
2019 were. Their mood was one of deep, cold, frustration and betrayal. Pessimism, even despair, perhaps, but
also disdain.
• “I had failed them, for sure, but clearly so had the other grown-ups in their lives. I was shaken.”
The kids are not ok - Julia Steinberger
• Even if all of us do our best as individuals, it isn’t enough. We need system changes.
• We are the first generation to know the scale of the problem. Let’s avoid being told:
“You did this. You knew. You did nothing but hide from it.”

What to do (group)
Individual v Collective action?
• False dichotomy?
• Individual action doesn’t tangibly move the needle – but still meaningful
• No more individual vs collective action: we need both to protect our climate (theecologist.org)
• But that piece begins:
• “While we busy ourselves greening our personal lives, fossil fuel corporations are rendering
these efforts irrelevant. A hundred companies are responsible for an astonishing 71% of GHGs
since 1988.
• "The freedom of these corporations to pollute – and the fixation on a feeble lifestyle response –
is no accident. It is the result of an ideological war, waged over the last forty years, against the
possibility of collective action.
• “Neoliberalism has exalted the individual at the expense of our collective bonds: we are
encouraged to think of ourselves as consumers, not citizens.
• And so we are told to tackle climate change with our personal cash (if we can afford it) and not
our community. Being a ‘green’ consumer might help us to feel less guilty, but it is only collective
action that will effectively tackle the climate crisis.”
• So, both – but collectively we are much more effective

So the rest of this talk will be much more interesting if
What to do (group)
you NOW hold the thought “I will do something

collaborative”, and then hunt for that thing (or things!)
Maybe have a pen and paper handy?
There are many other (better!) resources, e.g.:
Things that no longer comfort me - Julia Steinberger
“What lies in front is still undetermined,
and can still be changed. But it will take
the fight of our lives, for all of our lives, to
change this. This will not be fun, or
fulfilling, or a worthy adventure of self-
discovery, or a cute feel-good movie, or a
task of personal validation. I mean,
maybe from time to time there will be those things, who knows.
Who cares. This is a fight for life itself.. Learn to become a
revolutionary, get some courage and guts and analysis.

activism and how to find your place in them.”

What to do (group)
Individual v Collective action?
Two further quotations from Julia S:
• “The thought process where we excuse one category of terrible
actions (say, driving an SUV ..) by reminding ourselves of some small
token gestures (like recycling ..) .. justifies large crimes using small
band-aids, and it should comfort no one.”
(I.e. Stop obsessing with individual actions.)
• “.. Crucially .., individual action on its own, unaccompanied by other
measures, may be almost worse than nothing. .. If our “avert
planetary disaster” time budget is entirely used up in working on our
own personal purity zero-carbon goal, with nothing left over for
getting our pension fund to divest from fossil fuels, our efforts will be
obviously terribly ineffective in terms of hours spent to carbon
emissions averted.”

What to do (group)
Act
• We need Govts to be useful, part of the solution, not part of the problem
• Which means we have to use our power as citizens/voters
• KEY RESOURCE: Dr. Aaron Thierry – How to defeat the Fossil Goliath? - I strongly encourage you to read it
• (Available there as PPT or PDF. NB the first 20-30 slides are about the problem, not action – so scroll down.)
We often
behave as if
what we can do
is decided by
the ‘higher-ups’
When in reality,
collectively, we
are the ones
holding them in
place.

page ============ 9 ==========
What to do (group)
Act - Aaron Thierry’s list
1. Litigation
• Criminalise polluting behaviour
• Enforce existing laws via (crowd-funded) litigation
2. Legislation
• Work on Political Parties so they shift their policies/priorities
• FF Non-proliferation Treaty (modelled on nuclear NPT)
• Make ecocide a crime
• Ad bans for FFs etc
3. Make institutions divest
4. Expose Greenwashing via expertly designed PR campaigns
5. Fight the Banks and other big funders of FF investments
• Make sure Insurers shy away from insuring FF projects
6. Discourage talent from working in FFs
• Ban FF-related attendees at University Jobs Fairs / Careers Services
7. Destroy Arts/Sport sponsorship (social respectability, “giving something back”) by FF cos
8. Direct Action to block FF extraction/exploration/transport
• Especially by supporting Indigenous Peoples
• They often have legally enshrined special rights / own important land
• Draw attention to (Naomi Klein’s terms):
• ‘Blockadia’ (zones off-limits to local citizens) and
• ‘Sacrifice Zones’ (wastelands pillaged leaving local citizens to suffer, eg Niger delta)
“So this is how we win:
• By growing & diversifying the climate movement
• By taking away all the pillars of support of the fossil fuel industry.
• By fighting back!”

How?
• Domains (focuses for activity), and Methods (kinds of activity)
• The designations are rough and ready – some may disagree with particular instances
• Incomplete lists of organisations/resources
• But should help you decide where to focus your energies
• NB. many big charities like 350.org (“building a future that's just, prosperous, equitable and safe from the
effects of the climate crisis”), Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace UK have a broad focus covering various
Domains.
• Not covered further, but good option if you want a broad focus
• Watch out for greenwashing in some entities (commercial, but also some charities) that want to look
‘close’ to climate action, but really focus on a very peripheral aspect. E.g….
• Renewable energy company Drax - The Green Energy Scandal exposed
• Virgin Airlines - ‘World’s first net zero transatlantic flight’ labelled as greenwash | openDemocracy “Even if every
drop of used cooking oil available globally were refined into jet fuel, there would only be enough to power about
one in every 40 flights”, according to estimates by sustainable fuel consultancy Cerulogy.

What to do (group)
Methods
A. Demonstrations & marches - usually in person but can include online events, e.g. coordinated posting on social media of photos or placards
B. Direct action/civil disobedience – eg sit-ins, disruptions of meetings/conferences, blocking oil and gas facilities.
• “Protest is like begging the powers that be to dig a well. Direct action is digging a well and daring them to stop you.” David Graeber
• “Radical transformation is needed, including mass civil disobedience - this really is the last chance saloon for avoiding climate-driven
societal collapse.” Jonothan Porritt (“Hope in Hell”)
C. Campaigning, Persuasion & Influence – write to MPs, give talks, organise events, petitions, social media, mass phoning
D. Financial – donate, divest, invest, support (or initiate!) shareholder actions
E. Non-financial support – lots of charities, NGOs and pressure groups welcome non-financial support eg with administrative tasks, design,
finance, fundraising
Also….
• Talk! - Useful Guide on how to engage people: ClientEarth_Guide_to_Having_Climate_Conversations (will cover next week)
• Personal action! – covered last week, but also… the “Leeds 6”:
• Making six commitments could account for a quarter of the emissions reductions required to keep the global heating down to 1.5C. The basis
of a new climate movement to persuade and support relatively well off people to “Take The Jump” and sign up to six pledges:
• Eat a largely plant-based diet, with healthy portions and no waste
• Buy no more than three new items of clothing per year
• Keep electrical products for at least seven years
• Take no more than one short haul flight every three years and one long haul flight every eight years
• Get rid of personal motor vehicles if you can – and if not keep hold of your existing vehicle for longer
• Make at least ONE life shift to nudge the system, like moving to a green energy/insulating your home/changing pension supplier
• To which I’d add one more (which makes this a collective action :)
• Do it yourself, and then persuade TWO friends to do the same (including this 7th pledge!)

Methods – A note on Activism
• Has Activism become a dirty word? Maybe – it’s certainly come to have a lot of baggage attached.
• Rupert Read: “I’ve been thinking, therefore, about what the barriers to entry are in activism, and trying to
develop a proposal for a ‘moderate flank’ to take advantage of the space that Extinction Rebellion’s success in
consciousness-raising has opened up. Those barriers include feeling like you:
• need to get arrested
• need to be a hippie
• have to be left wing
• have to be Green
• have to buy into the whole agenda of identity politics.”
• If you feel any of these things, read his piece on the moderate flank(s) linked above.
• “the stakes are far too high for such narrow-minded purism. We can’t justify being complicit in crashing our entire
civilisation just because we are determined to be dogmatic about (say) the EU, or immigration policy, or wokeness. So
it’s imperative we chart a realistic, inclusive (of those whose politics is not identical to our own) way forward. One
which can have genuinely wide appeal.”
• Ask: “what is your unique/best contribution to this project. How are you best-placed to make it tangible. To find and
grow meaning, in this time of existential threat. Through your work? Through being a parent? Through your
community?” Do that J
• And, to repeat, Julia Steinburger’s ‘Audacious Toolkit’ is also reassuring – lots to do that doesn’t
involve risk of prison.

What to do (group)
Domains of action – 1. End fossil fuel extraction
• “When the bath is overflowing, the first thing is to turn off the tap.”
• Mostly direct action groups, but:
• Many also take donations
• Or you can offer supportive actions such as writing to MPs or joining social media campaigns
• Stop Cambo – Cambo is one of the North Sea’s undeveloped oil and gas fields – activists have forced Shell to pull out, future uncertain.
Now tackling Rosebank - the biggest undeveloped oil and gas field in the North Sea (500m barrels, nearly 3X Cambo, almost all oil
which will be exported). The UK government recently approved developing the field – but it’s not over yet.
• 9th December 2023 - Day of Action during COP28 | Campaign against Climate Change (campaigncc.org) – “Rapid, just and equitable
phaseout of all fossil fuels” (and other demands) – fairly radical group. Lots of other groups aiming at COP28.
• Stop Adani - fighting to stop the Adani conglomerate from developing the Carmichael coal mine (the largest ever in Australia), and
more generally fighting against use of coal anywhere.
• Stop EACOP – Major new pipeline in Africa, which threatens to displace people from their land, puts vital water sources at risk that
millions of people rely upon for drinking and food production, runs through some of the world’s most important elephant, lion and
chimpanzee nature reserves, may open up more critical ecosystems to even more oil extraction – and CO2 of course.
• Fossil Free London - to tarnish the image of the FF industry and attack its social license. E.g. at industry events (like AGMs), and places
where the industry uses sponsorship to boost its image (like the Science Museum climate exhibition sponsored by Shell)
• Just Stop Oil - a coalition of groups working together to hold the government to its own commitments on ending new exploration,
development and production of fossil fuels in the UK. Worth a visit for the library of news clips etc.
• Or read the news and find your own angle! (News – DeSmog is a good place to start.)

• How divested is your Council? See here: Divest your council - UK Divest (more tools etc here).
• Go Fossil Free UK - city by city, town by town, building a movement to take back power from the fossil fuel industry, and build an energy
system that works for all.
“If it’s wrong to wreck the planet, its
• Fossil free research - No more fossil fuel research money wrong to profit from that wreckage!”
• Kick Fossil Fuels Out of Football – good for awareness-raising outside usual circles @billmckibben
• BankTrack - the international tracking, campaigning and civil society support organisation targeting private sector commercial banks
(‘banks') and the activities they finance (founded in 2003).
• Aim to challenge banks globally to act urgently and decisively on the accelerating climate crisis (here), the ongoing destruction of nature
(here), pandemics, and human rights
• Action against Insurers – sample tookit here: Workshop EACOP & Lloyd's of London (June 2022).pdf
• Reclaim Finance – [despite the hype] almost all financial services remain geared towards practices that depend on the consumption of
fossil fuels and the overexploitation of natural resources. Aims to accelerate the decarbonization of financial flows, acting as a citizen
counterweight - current action is not sufficient. Tracks and analyses the activities of financial institutions, and exposes the real impacts of
their activities. See also: https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/ - check yours is listed!
• Forests & Finance – Resource to assess who finances over 300 companies directly involved in the beef, soy, palm oil, pulp and paper,
rubber and timber supply chains, whose operations may impact natural tropical forests and local communities in the Global South. (Ditto
for 22 mining companies operating there.)
• Coalition of campaign & research orgs incl Rainforest Action Network, Amazon Watch, BankTrack, and Friends of the Earth US.
• Seeks to stop lenders from facilitating abuses common in ‘forest risk commodities’, via improved financial sector transparency, policies,
systems and regulations.

Domains of action – 3. Climate Justice
• The sole achievement of COP27 was acceptance of need for Climate Justice
• Not much progress – no numbers, no concrete commitments, but acceptance of the principle that rich polluting countries
won’t prevent excess warming without helping poorer countries adapt
• It’s like the Church Steeple Restoration fund has set up a committee to discuss it, and someone’s labelled a (still empty)
bucket...
• Fridays for Future, especially Global South groups such as Fridays for Future Bangladesh (seems inactive in UK at present)
• Parents for Future
• Debt for Climate - a Global South-driven coalition connecting social & climate justice struggles, by uniting labour, social and climate
movements from the Global South & North toward a common goal of turning debt-trap diplomacy on its head by cancelling the debt of
impoverished nations as a way to pay for leaving fossil fuels in the ground and financing a just transition. (A global Debt-for-Climate
initiative could leave trillions of dollars in FFs in the ground, while freeing countries from a strangling debt burden often used as a tool
for further extraction.)
• The Campaign against Climate Change Trade Union group
• Ende Gelände International – mainly German local groups, but you could set one up here!
• Climate - Global Justice Now - Tell big polluters to pay for their climate damage (sign their petition)
• Cambs Climate Justice Coalition – and other like-minded groups formed in wake of COP26 (not sure if still going but very local and
findable people involved).

• The court ordered Shell to change its policy in order to prevent future damage.
• As well as emissions resulting from its own operations, it must also take responsibility for bringing down its ‘downstream emissions’, i.e.
the emissions resulting from the burning of its products.
• Actions now underway since October 2022 by green groups against the latest round of UK OG licensing.

• Lobby political parties to prioritise climate action
• Climate policies of various parties, e.g.: Labour’s official policy (Dec 22) is here. It’s ‘a bit thin’, but there is pressure to make it more ambitious
(here).
• Tell them climate policy is THE key criterion in deciding who to vote for (a personal action that becomes collective if you encourage
others…)

• By signing up you commit to vote in the next GE based on who you feel will work for urgent action on the climate and nature, giving
your particular concerns/reasons.
• They collate (first names and reasons) and forward to the relevant candidates. Not partisan.
• Greenpeace Project Climate Vote - an a-political campaign to persuade people to declare that climate will be a major (or ‘the’) priority in their
voting decision at the next election.

Plans for Actions. Ideal if Zoomers can join in person! (We might need a bigger room…)
