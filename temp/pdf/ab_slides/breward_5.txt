Misinformation
Mis or Dis?
• Misinformation is “false information that is spread, regardless of intent to mislead.”
• Intent is not important, the label is for any kind of wrong or false information
• We all do it sometimes, spreading what we believe to be true, even where it’s not the whole story, or just plain wrong.
• It’s damaging, but not a sin, just human.
• Disinformation is “deliberately misleading/biased information; manipulated narrative/facts; propaganda.”
• A lot of disinformation is skilfully crafted (to include emotive triggers, conflate two things, hide the full picture, etc)
• And skilfully disseminated (as to timing, audience selection, medium used, etc.)
• Save where used to protect a child against the full horror about Santa Claus, disinformation is a sin (reprehensible)
• And therefore is usually crafted or disseminated so that:
• the true source is hard to find, and/or
• if found can claim it wasn’t meant like that (“taken out of context” etc)
• That’s why there are “useful idiots” – people who, once they’ve swallowed the nonsense, become its greatest advocates,
often researching further, gathering defences to counter-claims etc.
• I use the term misinformation here, because I want you to be the one to decide whether it is also disinformation.
(Sometimes it will be obvious what my view is, but we should all be charitable where we can be.)

The big picture
• Vested interests have known for a long time that Fossils Fuels → dangerous levels of
Climate Damage
• Exxon scientists in the 1970s accurately predicted climate change | New Scientist
• Exxon Mobil accurately predicted global warming in the 1970s, new study shows | Daily Mail Online
(if you want to amaze yourself, go to this DM article, note there are 88 comments where fifteen stories on the same day
about Harry & Megan all got thousands, and then read them! Almost every trope denying Climate Change thrives there)
• They have huge resources, which they use to manipulate people
• They know as well as anyone HOW to do this manipulation:
• The old phrase “Fear, uncertainty, doubt” (FUD) – based on misinformation
• They can pay well for expertise
• And there’s a roadmap: The “Tobacco Playbook” (more anon)
• Politicians connive, because:
• Due to ‘Money in Politics’, they must!
• They are, to a significant extent, the same people
• Politics is the art of the possible. Until voters care, acting is suicidal
• Here’s a picture of what we’re up against →

Misinformation
How?
First technique:
DISMISS the problem
• Deny it
• It’s not warmer / this is natural and normal (e.g. “medieval warm period”, the 50s and
60s, the pause in the “hockey stick” in the early 2000s)
• The models are hopelessly wrong (unrealistic / unreliable / retro-fitted)
• (Patient rebuttal by Katherine Heyhoe: Climate Models | Global Weirding - YouTube
• The models are intentionally wrong (Orchestrated conspiracy - Soros/Maurice Strong)
• George Soros crops up in pretty much every conspiracy! “He’s a billionaire” - funding this!
• Ignoring about 3,000 other billionaires, mostly aligned on the other side
• “They’re only in it for the money” (!)
• (Exasperated rebuttal by Katherine Heyhoe: Climate change, that's just a money grab by
scientists... right? - YouTube)
• Deathropomorphise it, i.e. Accept it but deny the cause
• Ok it is warmer, BUT it’s not humans doing this (e.g. Solar activity)

page ============ 6 ==========
Misinformation
How? – Dismissal (not happening) – Example: “the Pause” (used for years around 2010)
• ‘Pauses’ do happen
• But then they end…
• Lomberg: ‘look at the drop’ (2008)
• Mostly, this kind of nonsense is no
longer respectable
• So… Lomberg has now reinvented
himself as a down-player (more
anon)
• A reusable falsehood: “Global
warming appears to have halted
in 1998”—an earlier claim that
subsequent research has
disproved and which NOAA
has deconstructed in a Q&A

Misinformation
How? – Dismissal – “not us”
• No, it’s not solar
activity
• (Or volcanoes, etc etc)
Climate.nasa.gov
• In general, the data
shows that, based on
other natural factors,
the Earth should be
cooling right now

page ============ 8 ==========
Misinformation
How? – Dismissal ---> Discombobulation
• Dismissers are now a minority (7%), and dwindling, even in the republican areas of the US
• There is a tsunami of data and evidence for AGW*, such that to doubt it you must also believe in a very large,
very sophisticated conspiracy
• Occam’s razor ought to be a useful tool: what’s the least contrived explanation?
• Although still some total loons like Peter Thiel (“democracy and freedom are incompatible”) who use Dismissers
as ‘useful idiots’
• Most ‘professional’ obstructors have now switched tactics, from Dismissal to Discombobulation.
• There’s little point trying to convince a Dismisser – they’ll be impervious (cf Festinger: When Prophecy
Fails - Wikipedia)
• But it is worth convincing those less invested (the Discombobulated, i.e. confused), whose minds are open (cf
Munger’s “Egg”)
* AGW = Anthropic Global Warming

Misinformation
How? – Post-dismissal (the “Discombobulation” strategies)
• Deflectors - Not our/my problem (i.e. yes, it’s humans, but just not my tribe.)
• Population is the problem – stop ‘them’ breeding!
• Other countries are the problem – (especially China)
• “Never mind us, you’re the problem” – Personal Carbon Footprints (concept seeded by Big Oil!)
• Downplayers (not of the problem itself, or its size, but of the need for radical change)
• We can adapt to the impact (instead of stopping it happening)
• Tech will save the day
• Let’s keep talking, surely we can find some cost-free solutions.
• Distractors
• Change will be too painful
• We can’t afford it - People will be hurt by action
• Despairers (aka Doomers) - We can’t fix it / we’re doomed (So just carry on as you are)
And the playbook says - fund all of these..
heavily, quietly, indirectly, respectably, using subtle/catchy language, and cover your tracks!

Misinformation
How? – Post-dismissal (the “Discombobulation” strategies)
And (due to our defective human software) we are very receptive to these viruses!
• When the “strategy” of denying a problem is no longer tenable, we are programmed to:
• Deny we are responsible (Deflection)
• Make light of it (Downplayers)
• Put off any action, often finding “counter-balancing” reasons to not act. Change the subject (Distractors)
• Say it’s all too much / Que sera, sera (Despairers)
• These are all attractive, restful states of mind to be in
• relative to the discomfort of knowing “yes, we must all act - drastic change needed”
• even Doom, because it absolves you from the need to think or act
• Because it “sets minds at rest”, it’s quite easy for ‘certain agents’ to provide us with props, to help that
‘step-down’ from denial into some form of doldrums
• Let’s look at 12 doldrum mindsets (“Discourses of Climate Delay”). Can you spot them in:
• Professionals/Pundits?
• Friends and family?
• Yourself??

• Exxon knew FF → dangerous global
warming since at least the 1970s,
probably since the 1950s

• Denial. Early 1980s - late 1990s
• Exxon modelled the impact of CO in the atmosphere, drew stark conclusions, then buried them.

• Doubt. 2000-2010
• Big Oil used paid lobbyists to influence both public and political opinion against science.
• Delay. 2011-2020
• Defending fracking for shale gas, despite knowing this caused huge increases in methane
released into the atmosphere
• Still happening….
• 2022.09.14 Hearing Report_PR Firms Preventing Action on Climate Change.pdf (house.gov)
• “The oil and gas industry’s role in spreading climate misinformation to prevent action on climate
change has been extensively studied, but less is known about the critical role of public relations (PR)
firms in that process. The House Natural Resources Committee (Committee) has been investigating
the sophisticated and varied ways in which some PR firms use their considerable public-influence
expertise to help industry mislead the public and block climate change policy proposals. This report
summarizes the investigative findings to date.”

Who
One might ask, how can they live with themselves?
• Human psychology
• The silo effect (“everyone I know works in Oil, they’re good guys, smart
guys, fun guys, kind to animals…”)
• Lots to lose
But as mentioned, we can’t change them, only protect others (and ourselves)
from swallowing their charms
So we need to look not just at the ‘why/who/what’, but also at the ‘how’
• So that we can sway those at the margin, who are swallowing the lies

How – follow the money
“It’s hard to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon
him not understanding it”
Upton Sinclair
Which is why corporates and wealthy individuals spend so much on people’s
salaries (and other funding)!
• Employees, fair enough
• Advisors, hmm ok maybe
• Politicians, definitely not!
• Yet a huge proportion of the cash funding US (and UK) politicians comes from Big Oil

How – subtle deception
• Oil companies discourage climate action, study says – Harvard Gazette
• “In 2017, I and Naomi Oreskes published a series of three papers focused on what you
might call traditional climate-science denial by ExxonMobil. Then, in May of this year,
we shifted gears slightly, releasing a new study looking at the company’s more subtle
forms of climate propaganda.
• “ExxonMobil misled the public about basic climate science and its implications. They
did so by contributing quietly to climate science, and loudly to promoting doubt about
that science.
• “.. over and over, ExxonMobil has misled the public about climate change by telling the
public one thing and then saying and doing the opposite behind closed doors. .. while
their tactics have evolved from outright, blatant climate denial to more subtle forms of
lobbying and propaganda, their end goal remains the same. And that’s to stop action
on climate change.”
Prof Supran, History of Science, Harvard
• E.g. “personal carbon footprint” concept — now ubiquitous — first popularized by BP as
part of a $100 million/year marketing campaign 2004-6.

Misinformation
How – subtle deception
• Oil companies discourage climate action, study says – Harvard Gazette
• “Mobil’s vice president and pioneer of PR in the ’70s and ’80s literally talked about what he called
‘semantic infiltration.’ He called it ‘the process whereby language does the dirty work of politics.’ And he
said that the first ‘general principle’ of PR was to, quote, ‘grab the good words … while sticking your
opponents with the bad ones.’ Our research now shows that’s exactly what they’ve been up to for
decades.”
• “[Exxon] thread a very fine rhetorical needle, using language about climate change just strong enough to
be able to deny that they haven’t warned the public, but weak enough to exculpate them from charges of
having marketed a deadly product. So .. their propaganda has .. shifted into high gear and is now
operating with a sophistication that we’ve never seen before. [They use]:
• the rhetoric of risk (vs certainty)
• individualized responsibility (vs corporates)
• “discourses of delay,” e.g. greenwashing, fossil-fuel solutionism, technological optimism, and so on.
• “These [techniques] are now pervasive in industry marketing and, in turn, in the ways that the public and
policymakers think and talk about the climate crisis.” Prof Supran, History of Science, Harvard
• Recall: “Do it heavily, quietly, indirectly, respectably, use subtle/catchy language and cover your tracks.. ”

How – the Tobacco PlayBook
• "That was a Eureka moment. We realised this was not a scientific debate. A person with expertise about
climate change would in no way be an expert about oncology or public health or cardiovascular disease, or
any of the key issues associated with tobacco.
• "The fact that the same people were arguing in both cases was a clue that something fishy was going on.
That's what led us to discover this pattern of disinformation that gets systemically used again and again."
• Naomi Oreskes spent years going through 14 million documents that were made available thanks to
litigation against US tobacco firms.
• A strikingly familiar story emerged. Decades before the energy industry tried to undermine the case for
climate change, tobacco companies had used the same techniques to challenge the emerging links between
smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s.
• It’s known as the “Tobacco Playbook” - "The purpose of these programmes was not to advance scientific
understanding, it was to create enough confusion that the public would doubt the existing scientific
evidence.“

Taking Stock – the story so far…
So there are three connected problems:
• Planetary destruction via AGW and related crises (Climate system failure)
• Our collective inertia, due to both
• Spineless, wrongly incentivised politicians (socio-political system failure)
• Complacency about where FMC is taking us (economic system failure)
• The active sabotage of the changes we need to implement, by vested interests
Now we have a clear diagnosis, we can begin to look at cures ☺ (next time )
In brief:
• Change, yourself
• BUT (even in aggregate) this isn’t going to be enough, or fast enough
• Our duty to our offspring extends beyond personal lifestyle adjustment
• Analogy: you’re part of a gang bullying the spotty kid, and deciding you’ll stop joining in the beatings
• You need to pressure the teachers (who are paid by the bullies to turn a blind eye) to stop the beatings
• Join forces with others to
• expose misinformation
• wake people up, &
• force politicians to act – they’ll benefit from a good smack!
• Avoid despair
• it’s only slightly ‘too late’ - every 0.1 deg C saved is hugely beneficial – and there are better and worse options
