That fixation has been used to justify extreme inequalities of income and wealth coupled with unprecedented destruction of the living world. For the twenty-first century a far bigger goal is needed: meeting the human rights of every person within the means of our life-giving planet.&#8221;</li></ul></p><p>2017</p><p>Kate Raworth<ul><li> Constructive points, but largely unheeded.

This is our last chance.&#8221;</li></ul></p><p>2018</p><p>Sir David Attenborough<ul><li> ")It is now indisputable that we are in a climate emergency. Soaring levels of .. greenhouse gases .. put the future of humanity at extreme risk. Global heating is already resulting in more extreme weather events at greater frequency, and some irreversible changes have now been triggered in our climate systems as tipping points are exceeded.</li></ul><ul><li> ")The first such tipping point is the Arctic Circle region. This region is warming four times faster than the global average, resulting in rapid and irreversible sea ice loss, and ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet. Arctic Sea ice loss is accelerating global warming via the reduction in albedo as the blue sea absorbs the sunlight, rather than ice reflecting the sun&#8217;s heat back out into space. Ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet is accelerating sea level rise, and is now irreversible. In addition, the Arctic region holds vast amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, locked within permafrost, which is now starting to thaw, with potentially disastrous consequences.&#8221;</li></ul></p><p>2022</p><p>Sir David King (Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Govt 2000-2007)</p></div><div><h2>slide 5</h2><p></p><p>A few warm-up exercises (3)<ul><li> Journalists, then scientists, but not many politicians&#8230; (Caroline Lucas fighting alone under FPTP)</li></ul><ul><li> ")We should abandon the illusion that our politicians will come to the rescue of planet Earth, especially those who delight in calling themselves climate leaders.
