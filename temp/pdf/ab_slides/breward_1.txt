• Not an expert! An absolute amateur!
• Studied sciences to A level about a million years ago
• Worked in IT, law and commerce, now retired
• Always most interested in logic, rationality and ethics
• Increasingly interested in the flaws in human thinking capabilities
• Personal belief that Climate change is the biggest thing we face
• Vastly bigger than Brexit, impactful though that was
• Much bigger than Covid, ditto
• Not as big as Artificial (General) Intelligence
• But if we don’t fix CC, we won’t see AGI!

A few warm-up exercises (1)…
• “It doesn't matter how many windmills or solar panels or nuclear plants you build if you are not
simultaneously retiring fossil fuel production. We need a global programme whose purpose is
to leave most coal and oil and gas reserves in the ground, while developing new sources of
power and reducing the amazing amount of energy we waste.”
2013
George Monbiot
• “For over 70 years economics has been fixated on GDP, or national output, as its primary
measure of progress. That fixation has been used to justify extreme inequalities of income and
wealth coupled with unprecedented destruction of the living world. For the twenty-first century
a far bigger goal is needed: meeting the human rights of every person within the means of our
life-giving planet.”

A few warm-up exercises (2)…
• “Climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. It could lead to the collapse of
civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world. We are facing a man-made disaster of
global scale. This is our last chance.”
2018
Sir David Attenborough
• “It is now indisputable that we are in a climate emergency. Soaring levels of .. greenhouse gases ..
put the future of humanity at extreme risk. Global heating is already resulting in more extreme
weather events at greater frequency, and some irreversible changes have now been triggered in our
climate systems as tipping points are exceeded.
• “The first such tipping point is the Arctic Circle region. This region is warming four times faster than
the global average, resulting in rapid and irreversible sea ice loss, and ice loss from the Greenland
ice sheet. Arctic Sea ice loss is accelerating global warming via the reduction in albedo as the blue
sea absorbs the sunlight, rather than ice reflecting the sun’s heat back out into space. Ice loss from
the Greenland ice sheet is accelerating sea level rise, and is now irreversible. In addition, the Arctic
region holds vast amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, locked within permafrost, which
is now starting to thaw, with potentially disastrous consequences.”

A few warm-up exercises (3)
• Journalists, then scientists, but not many politicians… (Caroline Lucas fighting alone under FPTP)
• “We should abandon the illusion that our politicians will come to the rescue of planet Earth,
especially those who delight in calling themselves climate leaders. Time and again they have
betrayed the faith that has been placed in them – using greenwashing and PR strategies disguised
as politics.
But
• “We cannot despair… A critical mass of people … will no longer tolerate the procrastination, denial
and complacency... It is not too late. We have a duty to help as many of our fellow citizens as
possible understand the dire situation we are in. We must all do more to explain, inform and
educate; public pressure can create profound change.”

What is the “Climate Change” issue?
• Objective science
1. The planet is warming up
2. Rising CO levels are the cause of planetary warming
2
3. Humans are the major cause of the observed warming
4. Burning Fossil Fuels is the main reason
• Sociopolitical impacts
• Social – habitability/migration, food scarcity, water wars
• Political – nationalism (even fascism), ever more rot (from ever more lying)
• Economic – cracks (disruption, resource scarcity), implosion (systemic contagion)
• And embracing all of these: Fairness – Injustice rots the SPE fabric.
• Inter-related crises
• Sea-level rise
• Bio-diversity loss → collapse
• Pollution.. Etc etc
• Options / choices
• Not all is lost yet
• But this is all-pervasive, and urgent

Framing Climate Change
What is the “Climate Change” issue?
• ‘Climate Change’ sounds not too bad
• We all love a nice climate, and often change is good.
• Climate Change is a neutral term, but really we should be thinking
in terms of
• Climate Breakdown (where the weather gets more turbulent, and regular
weather patterns break down – gulf stream, el nino, monsoon, etc)
• Climate Emergency
• Climate Crisis
• Even Extinction
• I think my preferred term is…
• Crisis (pure and simple)
• Because it’s not just the climate

Inter-related Crises
Global Warming from Fossil Fuels links to….
• Deforestation
• Sea Level rise / melting icecaps (feed back via Albedo)
• Ocean warming and acidification
• Food Waste
• Food/Water insecurity
• Agricultural profligacy - land, soil (erosion), fresh water, fertilizers, pollution
• (Human) population growth
• Consumer culture / Fast Fashion / Planned Obsolescence
• Chemical / Plastic Pollution
• Air pollution
All of which cause
• Biodiversity Loss (and if we carry on, Collapse, which WILL destroy us…)

Inter-related Crises
But it’s not just the environmental impacts….
In a perverse and highly damaging way, CC also links (causally in both
directions) to
• Poor Governance
• market failures/poor price signals/externalities/current pricing of future effects
• due to Govts failure to update legislation - it worked OK before we got addicted
to Fossil Fuels, now their inaction is disastrous
• Political mendacity, and straight forward corruption
And finally to
• Injustice
• do we believe in fairness? Or is it Dog-eat-Dog?
• Can WE thrive in a chaotic , violent world? (More in next seminar)

A big (related) issue
Liberal Democracy
• Illiberal Leaders
• for Life…. Putin, Xi Jing Pin
• for the ill-educated…. Trump
• other strongmen… Bolsonaro (despatched for now), Erdogan, Modi, Kim
• Undemocratic Systems
• Cambridge Analytica, Facebook , silos, dark ads (i.e. invisible lies)
• 200 FB ‘likes’ tell CA enough to know (i.e. predict) you better than anyone except spouse
• powerful non-democracies (China)
• sham democracies (Russia for sure, ..)
• FPTP in UK, Electoral College in US
• Wealth concentration – inexorably getting worse
• International institutions under attack
• EU via Brexit, AfD, Le Pen, Melone, Orban, Fico in Slovakia (though recent positive news in Poland…)
• UN, WHO, etc via Trumpism, Russian invasion of Ukraine
• And generally, tensions in West as China/India return to being the “centre of the world”
• Polarising conflicts like Israel/Palestine
• All of these cut BOTH ways – CC feeds them, and they feed CC inaction

• Human Time – where do we fit in time

Framing Climate Change
A range of positions on CC
• Various stances:
1. It’s all nonsense
2. It’s an issue but overblown, e.g. tech will get us through
3. It’s pretty important, but I am powerless
4. It’s very serious, and we’ve a lot of work to do
5. It’s super-serious, but it’s too late.
• I won’t be spending much time on positions 1, or 2 (partly because there is so
much scope for using 2 cynically, to undermine 4!)
• I won’t be doing ‘both sides’ or ‘who knows!’
• Because we do know, and there’s only one respectable position now (which is 4).
• Most people are now in 3 – and it’s wrong. The point of this course is to convince
you that there are still lots of things you can and must do both as an individual
and as a group.
• 5 is also wrong. We are not in the territory of stopping the climate crisis (it’s
already too late) but there is lots of scope for averting the worst outcomes.
• Given that it IS very serious and there ARE lots of things we can do, how come we
aren’t doing them? We will also cover this.

Framing Climate Change
The Short version of this course
• It is NOT too late
• There is a continuum, and some really bad outcomes are already baked in, due to our inertia
• BUT
• We will ensure FAR worse outcomes if we keep rearranging deck-chairs
• So action is urgent
• Sometimes we hear a debate in terms of
• “should we do X, or is Y better?”
• “we should do X, but right now we have a bigger issue”
• “we could do X, but unless they do X too, it’s pointless”
The truth is
• everyone
• needs to be energetic about doing all they can,
• now.
• No-one is riding to our rescue, least of all our Govts.
• There are powerful entrenched forces opposing what needs to be done.
• If you want to be part of the problem, rather than part of the solution, look away now…

• Drop Home heating 1 degree C – woolly hat indoors!
• Investigate heat-pumps (not yet right for everyone)
• Reduce Consumption generally
• the best device is the one you already own

• Buy (almost) everything second hand. Recycle don’t discard.
• But the most important things are about collective action…
• Talk to people, a lot, repeatedly – see guides on reading list (we will revisit near the end)
• Find others, and collaborate to:
• Gather information (as you are doing right now!)
• Write to people with power (e.g. your MP), and say:
• Your next vote will be ONLY on Climate issues, tired of fence-sitting & platitudes, needs guts & sweeping
changes
• See https://www.thecommitment.uk/ which does this for you
• Support people protesting, even think about protesting yourself.
