Scientists<ul><li> The source of the famous &#8220;97% of scientists&#8230;&#8221; claim:</li></ul><ul><li> Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature (iop.org)</li></ul></p><p>2013 John Cook, Dana Nuccitelli, Sarah A Green, Mark Richardson, Barbel Winkler, Rob Painting, Robert Way, Peter Jacobs and</p><p>Andrew Skuce. Universities of Queensland, Western Australia, McClellan CA, Reading, Newfoundland, George Mason University USA,</p><p>BC Canada.<ul><li> We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer- reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991&#8211;2011 matching the topics &#8216;global climate change&#8217; or &#8216;global warming&#8217;. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.</li></ul><ul><li> Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. .. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.</li></ul><ul><li> Despite these independent indicators of a scientific consensus, the perception of the US public is that the scientific community still disagrees over the fundamental cause of GW. From 1997 to 2007, public opinion polls have indicated around 60% of the US public believes there is significant disagreement among scientists about whether GW was happening (Nisbet and Myers 2007).</li></ul><ul><li> The Cook et al. (2013) 97% consensus result is robust (skepticalscience.com)</li></ul><ul><li> This work was done in 2013, shortly after the &#8216;great pause&#8217; had run its course.
