Introduction
You need to get the bus from A to B, and its getting late.
• A drunk in the bus shelter says the bus to B is due in 10 minutes
• A bus arrives instantly. The driver says it’s not going to B.
• A descending passenger whispers that this driver always lies, and it will go there next.
• A fellow on a nearby bench chuckles that the bus is making a noise that means its engine won’t last more
than another mile.
• A man strolls by calling out that all routes to B are flooded except a back route that buses can’t use, and he
has a taxi.
• Then a second bus arrives (it’s been 10 minutes), whose sign says C, but driver says he’ll stop at B and he
thinks the road is probably open.
What do you do? Two points:
1. You can’t verify all information yourself. You have to decide:
• What information you trust
• Whose judgement you trust
• Who has what expertise
• How to weigh the claims (could they be honest or expert - but wrong, or drunken - but right?)
• How to weigh the outcomes from different choices and delay - are you checking out a new pub in B, or meeting the pope?
2. Anyone wanting to stop you succeeding has to work out how to mislead you.
And that’s just getting a bus!

Key Questions
To make sense of the Climate Problem, we need to ask about
• Key Players
• Who are they? Are they:
• Competent?
• Disinterested?
• Being honest (the whole truth)?
• Human Psychology
• Why is no-one doing anything?
• How is our much-vaunted human capacity for rational thought leading to
action failing us?

Key Players – involved in Climate Change
In roughly the order of engagement in the issue as a serious problem:
1. Activists and ‘Green’ Organisations
2. Scientists
3. Media
• Though media owners are usually in 5
4. Politicians/Governments
• Excluding those of major FF-exporting Countries (OPEC etc)
• But also including General Business
• And International Bodies (set up by Govts)
5. Think Tanks (lickspittles*)
6. The Super-rich and their (other) lickspittles (Tax advisors, Lobbyists, PR firms etc)
7. “Big Oil” (incl Gas & Coal) – both Corps and Countries
• Including Intensive FF-Using Corps
*Lickspittle: “a service provider who earns $1m pa helping a billionaire work at becoming a trillionaire…”.
Crumbs off the master’s table. (Yes, a pejorative term, which I feel able to use because I was among them,
before I was cured. As individuals, they are mostly good people: cf “Swimming with Sharks: Joris Luyendijk,

Key Players – 1. Activists and ‘Green’ Organisations
We’ll cover in depth in later sessions (on ‘What to do’), but a few
comments:
• It’s a broad church
• MLK was the reasonable face of Civil Rights, but there were more radical agents
• Who never aimed to popular, but helped make people listen to MLK
• A bit like XR, SchoolStrike, Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil etc today…
• As things get worse, it’s a growing church - all are welcome
• As I’m trying to show, activism is all there is between us and Armageddon

Key Players – 2. Scientists
• The source of the famous “97% of scientists…” claim:
• Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature (iop.org)
2013 John Cook, Dana Nuccitelli, Sarah A Green, Mark Richardson, Barbel Winkler, Rob Painting, Robert Way, Peter Jacobs and
Andrew Skuce. Universities of Queensland, Western Australia, McClellan CA, Reading, Newfoundland, George Mason University USA,
BC Canada.
• We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-
reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics ‘global
climate change’ or ‘global warming’. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6%
endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.
• Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are
causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared
to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among
self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. .. Our analysis indicates that the
number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.
• Despite these independent indicators of a scientific consensus, the perception of the US public is that the
scientific community still disagrees over the fundamental cause of GW. From 1997 to 2007, public opinion polls
have indicated around 60% of the US public believes there is significant disagreement among scientists about
whether GW was happening (Nisbet and Myers 2007).
• The Cook et al. (2013) 97% consensus result is robust (skepticalscience.com)
• This work was done in 2013, shortly after the ‘great pause’ had run its course. One might expect
even stronger consensus now.

Key Players – 3. Media
How does Media engage and keep us?
• Stories (the human interest/drama, not the big picture – anecdote ALWAYS trumps data)
• Novelty (so corrections are late and hidden)
• Immediacy – the urgent, not the important
• Exaggeration sells
• Speculation (House prices “could” fall by 30%!)
• This is the norm with Climate stories
• A scientist (wanting her 15 min of fame) reports research that says Glaciers melting
• Journo asks ‘how long?’ Reply: ‘Anything from 10 to 100 years’
• Print it as: “Glaciers could disappear in 10 years”
• Leads to “crying wolf” strategy for ignoring those stories
Do these things matter:
• Money? (Most are businesses. BBC has political pressures. Guardian slightly insulated.)
• Truth? (Up to a point – must retain credibility – but often less important than money)
• Journalistic cognitive biases? (Yes – they’re human!)
• Balance? (Often badly done….)

Key Players – 3. Media – Climate Coverage
Media coverage of climate change – Wikipedia:
Journalists distort reality by:
• making scientific errors
• keying on human-interest stories rather
than scientific content
• rigid adherence to the construct of
balanced coverage.
Media Matters (US):
• of 127 segments on the global heat wave
that aired on ABC, CBS, and NBC in summer
2018, only one mentioned the connection
between climate change and extreme heat.
• in the height of hurricane season in 2017,
neither ABC nor NBC aired a single segment
on any news show that mentioned the link
between climate change and hurricanes:

• The pundit always sounds more authoritative
than the scientist
• Not bothered by ‘professional reputation’
• Not schooled in ‘academic debate’
• Skilful with sound bites
UK examples
• Julia Hartley-Brewer on QT very recently
(“It’s called weather”)
• On Nick Robinson (BBCR4today): “What makes

Key Players – 4. Politicians/Governments
Where to start?!
• Always and obviously: National Self-interest (Saudi sun spots…)
• Autocracies (mostly not very benevolent, usually kleptocracies)
• though cf Haiti/Dom Rep tree line:
• Democracies
• “We know exactly what to do. We just don’t know how to get re-elected if
we do it!”
• Election cycle time-frames very short
• Electability requires “Growth”
• GDP is an obsession, yet it’s a truly LOUSY measure of well-being
• A car-crash increases it. But not unpaid care.
• It has nothing to say about distribution or fairness.
• Very few elected officials are scientists etc.
• Electoral systems are rickety
• Voters are very largely ignorant
• So, even in Democracies, ‘what happens’ isn’t ‘what would be good for citizens’

Key Players – 4. Politicians/Governments
• It was ever thus – “what’s good for General Motors is good for America”
• Where politics is driven by money, Business will have (undue) influence
• Recent arrivals can be visible and brash (cf Elon Musk), or clumsy (cf Zuckerberg)
• But the old players are shadowy and silky smooth on how this works
• “The ideas we hold as axiomatic frame what other ideas we are able to have”
• Big Oil
• Has always been awash with cash
• Pay top dollar with lots of perks → high quality staff, then train them very well
• Massive, complex projects hone problem-solving (and problem-hiding..) skills
• These people are consulted by Govt over energy policies. Many are now IN government
• Big 4 Accounting firms (used to be 8, who let through the consolidation??)
• A near monopoly on the detailed expertise on how tax laws work
• Hired to help draft the laws
• Then hired privately to help evade them.
• In both cases, the ideas held as axioms act as a frame
• No thinking outside the box: “Imagine if we told the truth about Climate?”, “Imagine if we closed the tax havens?”
• The revolving doors – e.g. links between fossil fuel extractors, politicians, media etc
• Corruption is rife
• London is the global money-laundering capital - BBC Radio 4 - How to Steal a Trillion (Oliver Bullough)

Key Players, and Psychology
Key Players – 4. Politicians/Governments
• Governments ought to have real power to do what’s good for citizens. They can make new laws
• Sometimes Positive (eg NetZero commitments)
• Sometimes Negative (eg Policing Bill)
• But usually supine, until pulled by outcry – voters vote in a bad system twice a decade, lobbyists are on schmoozing every day
• Autocratic governments just decide what public opinion is going to be!
• But they tend to shape it to retention of power above all else
• Democratic governments do sometimes lead public opinion (UK death penalty)
• But only where it’s expedient, i.e.
• cheap and
• not threatening to them (even if a pain for the next lot)
• But ‘revolving door’ elites provide Politicians with many tools to retain elite privileges
• Money
• Talking Points (aka question everything, change the subject, tell a counter-anecdote)
• Techniques for Delay, Deception, Deflection
• Where they do follow public opinion, this is due to
• Electoral pressure (weak force)
• Media shaming (strong force, but usually, shaming is driven by expedience – the Media are largely captured)
• Civil unrest (strong force)

Key Players – 4. Politicians/Governments
But don’t hold your breath
• The forces for inertia are strong, well funded, and
embedded in Govt (Cf Crude Britannia)
• The default route to action is supposedly: events →
public opinion → electoral pressure → change. But
this mechanism won’t work fast enough. And Politicians
will not lead.
So, per Greta Thunberg’s comment quoted in seminar 1
(“abandon the illusion that our politicians will come to the
rescue”), and analyses of COP impacts, we can’t rely on
politicians sorting this out.
Yet, we CANNOT do it without them - because they have the
power.
So all of us who ‘get it’ need to work to raise public
awareness, and change public opinion, so that CC is the
paramount issue when they come to vote.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
• (under ‘Systems’ and ‘Evidence’, we’ve seen what the IPCC says, and that 27 COPs have not dented
CO2 growth, but not what it is, or why so ineffective)
• an intergovernmental body of the United Nations responsible for advancing knowledge on human-
induced climate change*
• Established in 1988 by
• the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and
• the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
• later endorsed by United Nations General Assembly
• 195 member states
• Consequently, IPPC conclusions are pretty ‘Middle of the Road’
• E.g. final moments of COP26 that had Sharma in tears – India “phase down” not “phase out” coal
• Although recently its WORDS are beginning to be pretty unequivocal that we face meltdown here
• Provides
• objective and comprehensive scientific information on ACC
• including the natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and
• possible response options
• Does NOT conduct original research or monitor climate change
• Informative and authoritative, but essentially Toothless

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
• Six ‘Assessment Reports’: 1990, 1995, 2001, 2007, 2014, 2021/2 – i.e. about every 5-7 years
• Inevitably ‘watered down’ in order to achieve a publishable consensus, but still the best comprehensive data
• First Report led to establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
What is a COP? (eg COP26)
• A “conference of the parties” (COP) is the supreme governing body of an international convention (written agreement between
actors in international law).
• To review progress and take decisions necessary to promote effective implementation
• So there are COPs for e.g. Chemical Weapons Convention, Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
• And more relevantly for our purposes:
• Convention on Biological Diversity
• Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
• Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
• United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
• Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
• First UNFCCC COP: Berlin 1995, then annually incl
• 1997 COP3 Kyoto • 2021 COP26 Glasgow
• 2009 COP15 Copenhagen • 2022 COP27 Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt
• 2015 COP21 Paris • 2023 COP28, Dubai (yes, F*ck$%g Dubai)
• All COPs fail, some more abjectly than others

Key Players – 5. Think Tanks
• Why do they exist?
• Universal suffrage!
• Who funds them?
• Those who prefer $1/1vote to 1person/1vote
• These are UK think tanks:
• Nb. IEA is also “International Energy
Authority”
• Global Policy Warming Foundation not rated
• denied for a long time that it took FF money,
until emails leaked showing it does…
• If you don’t know what “55 Tufton St” means,
time you did! Nest of astroturfing vipers
• In the US, the culture is more “it’s your
money, you can fund who you like”, so
transparency is very low, and the only
concern is foreign funding.
• So e.g. the infamous Koch brothers fund
Politicians direct as well as Think Tanks
• Source: www.transparify.org 2016 (seems to
have stopped flagging opacity, only
transparency – perhaps they were got at)

Key Players – 6. The Super-rich and their lickspittles
Background
• Income is very unequal, but wealth inequality is ‘off the scale’ – far worse.
• If you have £800,000 (e.g an average house without mortgage, plus a pension pot worth £15,000 a year), you are in the Global 1%: credit-suisse/global-
wealth 2022
• If you have £100,000 you are in the global top 1/8 (12.5%)

• Imagine a birthday cake for 8 kids is cut into 8.
• Here’s the first slice →
• Actually, it’s the BLUE bit, not the red!
• So one kid gets almost the whole cake, the next 3 need a fork, the last 4 just get crumbs
• But within the top 1/8 (12.5%) wealth is ALSO very skewed, and ditto within the top 1%
• So that blue area is not shared out evenly at all!
• By 2030
• the top 1% (70m) will have 2/3 of the entire pie – mid-blue (They already owned 1/2 in
2018)

• So 700,000 people have more financial clout than the bottom 7,000,000,000.
• And they chuck a few crumbs to a big chunk of the rest of the top 1%, for help keeping it that way
• The people who call the shots care more about protecting themselves than paying out so others
have a habitable planet

Key Players – 6. The Super-rich and their (other) lickspittles
• They have vastly disproportionate influence and access - to Politicians, rule makers, adjudicators and enforcers, public news, etc
• They can buy, and co-opt, the best talent to promote various protective narratives:
• Their huge success validates ‘the system’: they got wealthy by hard work, and you can too!”
• Really? The US has the biggest concentration of super-rich, and the 2nd highest MEAN average wealth.
• But US MEDIAN wealth is 18th, below the UK, France, Spain, Italy. I.e. the guy even half-way along the scale does NOT do well.
• Social mobility in the US and elsewhere is declining, and the US is lower than most of Europe. “Anyone can make it in… Sweden.”
• They “generate all the wealth”
• Long story, but this is unlikely to be near the truth, and is certainly not proven
• Not least because inheritance plays a huge part
• “Our wealth trickles down, so benefitting everyone” (demonstrably false)
• “Everything is just great” how it is now (well, they would say that!)
• They can insulate themselves from the rules
• Lobbyists, PR shills – influencing everything quietly, unattributably
• Revolving doors (Journalists, Politicians, Board Rooms) – keeping gate-keepers and whistle-blowers onside
• Investment bankers, the Big 4 Accounting/Tax firms – to globally manage capital protection & concealment, and tax-net design & avoidance
• Libel Lawyers, .. (“America has the best legal system money can buy.” And likewise in the UK and elsewhere. Law protects privilege & property.)
• A whole industry devoted to making them idols
• "In reality, we see a surprising support of the lifestyles of the very wealthy. People brought up in cultures that idolize the rich often oppose
policies to restrict them.” Prof Stefan Gössling, Lund University
• They have hugely polluting life-styles
• Yachts (each equating to 1-3 jumbo jets), private jets, multiple mansions, ostentation off the scale, and merchandising to the aspiring..
Despite the manifest obscenity of this
• The Super-rich themselves only emit about 3% of the total (30,000 x the average, BUT there are so few of them)
• HOWEVER, their impact on distracting, driving aspiration, and slowing system change, is surely MUCH greater.

• Stop those assets from being “stranded”
• Keep exploring and developing new fields
• Awash with cash
• Very well organised and experienced in operating Politically, Internationally, with some “challenging” regimes

good at it…
• Because they have taken the time to understand how people tick….

Psychology – Introduction
• Most people now accept as true that human activities are warming the planet
and this is very bad.
• Yet little is done – Why? We need to understand:
• How humans think and behave
• How we are less rational than we think we are
• We are much more easily influenced than we think (Vance Packard – The Hidden Persuaders)
• The science on this is over 50 years long and increasingly wide and deep
• The psychology of decision making
• Behavioural Economics
• Govts can ‘nudge’ for good, individual politicians can build followings on lies
• Businesses can use for commercial gain (which can be good or bad)
• When you make a lot of money, you can invest in the best expertise, techniques and campaigns
• The Fossil Fuel Industry has a lot of money…
• Only then can we understand Misinformation (next time)
• Who’s doing what to whom
• How

Psychology – How we really think (1)
• The world is very complex and fluid
• Our role and goals are undefined
• what are we for/what are we trying to do?
• Any decision we make (including whether to believe X) is made under
constraints:
• imperfect information ~ uncertainty
• time available
• processing power
• Hence: Heuristics or “less is more” (Herbert A Simon)
• E.g. Satisficing
• Seminal work – “Judgement under uncertainty” (Tversky & Kahneman)
• Availability – e.g. overestimate likelihood of dying in a dramatic event. Trains 100% heavier
than optimal.
• Representativeness – is quiet, bookish, shy Tom: a librarian? or an accountant?
• Anchoring – basing (numerical) decisions on earlier irrelevant numbers
• But Heuristics are not rational!

We are not just irrational, we are ‘predictably irrational’ (Dan Ariely) We can be manipulated! (Who knew)

Psychology – How we really think (3)
• Lots of unseen influences on our thinking
• Parole judges – Most important factor is whether they’re hungry…
• Power of persuasion ~ Placebos – “But I still need those sugar pills!”
• And then there’s Cognitive Dissonance
• ‘Mistakes were made (but not by me)’: Aronson & Tavris
• We can’t abide mental conflict
• E.g. “I’m a good person, yet I did that bad thing”
• We can’t give up that first belief, so we bend the second till it fits
• Hence there are always two accounts of any marriage break up
• “He did me no harm. But I played him an evil trick, and have hated him ever since”
(Pavlovitch, in The Brothers Karamasov - Dostoyevski)
• So, to solve the conflict
• We invent stuff
• We even bend our memories
• Which are surprisingly malleable: cf the case of Binyamin Wilkomirski/Bruno Grosjean….
• But most of all, we far too readily ACCEPT whatever meets our gut-instinct needs →

Psychology – How we really think (4)
• Our thinking is bent out of shape by many, many distinct Cognitive Biases
• But one of the strongest is Confirmation Bias. Have you ever done this?
• Yes (if you’re honest)! Did it make you feel better? Yes! Means your instinct was right!
• And even worse – you then become ‘toughened’ against new info:
• “the human mind is a lot like the human egg, and the human egg has a shut-off
device. When one sperm gets in, it shuts down so the next one can’t get in.”
Charlie Munger .

Psychology – How Misinformation Works (30,000 ft view)
• So,
• Our ‘human software’ is full of ‘bugs’
• Many are ‘hackable’
• Then the hackers can insert their ‘viruses’! (“Misinformation”)
• And we don’t feel a thing….
• Which is why we’ll need to get inside the heads of the hackers, and
understand how they do it.
• Of course, this is a simplistic account – misinfo is a wider thing than just
the creation, or validation, of false beliefs. It can also be used to
• Confuse us
• Persuade us to change the subject (all too hard)
• But that’s the whole new topic, for next time….
