BP first promoted and soon successfully popularized the term ")carbon footprint&#8221; in the early 2000s. The company unveiled its ")carbon footprint calculator&#8221; in 2004 so one could assess how their normal daily life &#8211; going to work, buying food, and (gasp) traveling &#8211; is largely responsible for heating the globe.</li></ul></p><p>United States 15.5</p><p>Japan 9.5</p><p>Nevertheless, if done correctly, and NOT used to pass the buck, they&#8217;re a useful tool.

Our economies are currently based on the goal of endless GDP growth, which fails to meet all our needs as it damages our planet. It is time to work toward a new goal: thriving in a safe and just space, or, as we like to call it, getting into the Doughnut!</li></ul><ul><li> See the big picture. We often hear about the power of the market to provide for us, but we must take a step back to see the big picture of the economy as embedded within, and dependent upon, society and the living world.</li></ul><ul><li> Nurture human nature. Doughnut Economics recognizes that humans aren&#8217;t just self-centered, acting in isolation, or behaving in predictably ")rational&#8221; ways, but are caring beings, adapting to their social context, and can nurture cooperation.</li></ul><ul><li> Think in systems. Doughnut Economics understands that economies are nonlinear complex adaptive systems like the roots of a forest, with independent agents, and not based on linear, reductionistic, or equilibrium models like the cogs of a machine.</li></ul><ul><li> Be distributive. Extreme inequality is a design failure of our current economic system. We recognize that there are many ways to design economies to be far more distributive of value among those who help to generate it.</li></ul><ul><li> Be regenerative. Environmental degradation is the result of degenerative industrial design. We can create a truly circular economy instead of thinking that someone else will clean up our mess.</li></ul><ul><li> Aim to thrive rather than to grow. It is time for us to recognize that nothing grows forever &#8211; living systems also need time to mature. Doughnut Economics rejects the idea that economies should grow whether or not they make us thrive, and advocates for an economy that makes us thrive whether or not it grows.</li></ul></p></div><div><h2>slide 8</h2><p></p><p>Tools &#8211; Thinking differently &#8211; Degrowth</p><p>Sustainable degrowth:<ul><li> Is a downscaling of production and consumption that increaseshuman well-being and enhances</li></ul><ul><li> ecological conditions, and</li></ul><ul><li> equity on the planet</li></ul><ul><li> Calls for a future where societies live</li></ul><ul><li> within their ecological means</li></ul><ul><li> with open, localized economies</li></ul><ul><li> with resources more equally distributed through new forms of democratic institutions</li></ul><ul><li> so that societies no longer have to ")grow or die&#8221;</li></ul><ul><li> Relegates materialaccumulationfrom prime position in the population&#8217;s cultural imagery.</li></ul><ul><li> With a focus onsufficiencynot efficiency</li></ul><ul><li> With innovation focused on new social and technical arrangements that will enable us to live convivially and frugally</li></ul><ul><li> [")PrivateSufficiencyandPublicWealth&#8221;: George Monbiot]</li></ul><ul><li> Removes GDP as the overarching policy objective and builds towards</li></ul><ul><li> alowerbutsustainablelevel of production and consumption</li></ul><ul><li> a shrinking of the economic system to leave more space for human cooperation and ecosystems</li></ul><ul><li> [GDP is a lousy proxy for well-being:</li></ul><ul><li> Car crashes &amp; drug rehabs raise it.

Talk like a human - Regular people aren&#8217;t policy wonks. Connect using language they understand.<ul><li> Words to avoid: &#8226; Decarbonization &#8226; Net zero &#8226; Anthropogenic &#8226; Green house gasses &#8226; Carbon footprint &#8226; 1.5 degrees &#8226; 100 year storm (what is that?)</li></ul><ul><li> Words to use: &#8226; Pollution &#8226; Overheating &#8226; Extreme weather &#8226; Costing people too much &#8226; The hottest year on record</li></ul></p><p>2. Don&#8217;t exaggerate The truth is motivating enough. Catastrophe messaging can be polarizing especially if it seems like it comes with a political agenda. The key is to make the connection so people understand it on their own, rather than yell ")CRISIS!&#8221; Be the rational source during the storm.</p><p>3. No partisanship Language can be political. Be mindful of perpetuating triggering tropes. Use language that appeals equally to conservative and progressive values. Simply saying ")it&#8217;s not political&#8221; immediately lowers people&#8217;s defenses</p><p>4. Keep it local We care about what we experience. Tie climate change to its real consequences. Avoid &#8216;Planetary&#8217;</p><p>5. Humans, not concepts People care about people, not abstract concepts. Spare us the theoreticals: global competitiveness, green innovation boom, economic leadership arguments. What works is that people like me are being affected</p><p>6. Fight pollution, not climate change We aren&#8217;t fighting climate change. We are fighting the polluters who are causing climate change</p><p>7. Focus on today The future is easy to ignore. What&#8217;s happening now matters now. Avoid &#8216;2030&#8217;, &#8216;2040&#8217; etc.</p><p>8. Messengers make the message People are more likely to trust information from trustworthy sources.
