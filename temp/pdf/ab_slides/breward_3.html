It has tracked the unprecedented recent rise in atmospheric CO and other GHGs since the beginning of the industrial</p><p>2 revolution.<ul><li> Since then, CO2 is up from 280 ppm to 387 ppm (40%) - highest for two million years.</li></ul><ul><li> Methane up from 715 ppb in 1750 to 1,774 ppm in 2005 - highest for at least 650,000 years.</li></ul></p><p>2. It knows from laboratory and atmospheric measurements that GHGs do indeed absorb heat when they are present in the atmosphere.</p><p>3. It has tracked significant increase in global temperatures of 0.85&#176;C and sea level rise of 20cm over the past century.</p><p>4. It has analysed the effects of natural events such as sunspots and volcanic eruptions on the climate, and though these are essential to understand the pattern of temperature changes over the past 150 years, they cannot explain the overall warming trend.</p><p>5. It has observed significant changes in the Earth&#8217;s climate system including<ul><li> reduced snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere</li></ul><ul><li> retreat of sea ice in the Arctic</li></ul><ul><li> retreating glaciers on all continents</li></ul><ul><li> shrinking of the area covered by permafrost and the increasing depth of its active layer.</li></ul><ul><li> All of which are consistent with a warming global climate.</li></ul></p><p>6. It continually tracks global weather and has seen significant shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme events.<ul><li> Patterns of precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) have changed, with parts of North and South America, Europe and northern and central Asia becoming wetter, while the Sahel region of central Africa, southern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia have become drier.</li></ul><ul><li> Intense rainfall has become more frequent, along with major flooding.</li></ul><ul><li> They&#8217;re also seeing more heat waves.
