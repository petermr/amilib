# Chapter 8: Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development
## Working Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability)

This chapter aims to better understand and analyse the human dimension of climate change at the interface of climate change, climate hazards, and socio-economic development. Areas of focus include:

### Climate Change and Inequality

- Climate change disproportionately affects marginalized groups
- Worsens existing vulnerabilities and inequalities
- Undermines sustainable development

### Vulnerability and Impact

- 3.3 billion people live in highly vulnerable countries
- Mortality from climate-related disasters 15 times higher in vulnerable regions
- Vulnerability linked to poverty, inequality, and historical factors

### Economic and Social Impacts

- Increasing economic and non-economic losses due to climate extremes
- Threatens achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals
- May force economic transitions among the poorest groups

### Adaptation and Development

- Urgent need for adaptation in vulnerable regions (e.g., parts of Africa, South Asia)
- Gender inequality hinders adaptation efforts
- COVID-19 pandemic has worsened climate vulnerabilities

### Climate Justice and Solutions

- Importance of rights-based approaches and climate justice
- Potential of nature-based solutions for livelihoods and adaptation
- Need for coherent governance and targeted adaptation finance

### Future Risks

- Higher emissions scenarios increase the risk of social tipping points
- Even moderate climate change may lead to humanitarian crises
- Adaptation limits for the most vulnerable populations
