The Chapter 5 from the IPCC AR6 WGII report highlights the significant impacts of climate change on food, fibre, and other ecosystem products. Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture are experiencing stress due to human-induced warming, which has slowed agricultural productivity, particularly in mid and low latitudes, and negatively affected crop yields. Warmer and drier conditions have increased tree mortality and forest disturbances. Ocean warming and acidification have reduced sustainable yields of wild fish and affected farmed aquatic species. Additionally, warming has altered species distribution and biological event timing, causing mismatches such as those between plants and pollinators, especially in high latitudes. Climate-related extremes like droughts, floods, and marine heatwaves have further reduced productivity in agriculture and fisheries, exacerbating food insecurity and affecting livelihoods. Vulnerable groups, including women, children, low-income households, and Indigenous communities, face higher risks of malnutrition, livelihood loss, and resource competition. Projections indicate that many current food production areas will become unsuitable under high-emission scenarios, and climate extremes will lead to simultaneous losses in major food-producing regions. Food security will worsen, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America, with higher CO2 levels reducing crop nutrient density. Outdoor workers and animals will face more heat stress, reducing labour capacity and productivity. Ecosystem services, including pollinator effectiveness, will decline, and marine fisheries and aquaculture will experience reduced productivity. Forest production will suffer in tropical regions, while temperate and boreal areas may see gains. Food contamination risks will rise due to higher temperatures and humidity. Adaptation strategies include cultivar improvements, community-based adaptation, agricultural diversification, and adaptive eco-management in fisheries. Ecosystem-based approaches, such as diversification, land restoration, agroecology, and agroforestry, can strengthen resilience with multiple co-benefits. The bioeconomy, through bio-based products, can support adaptation and mitigation with transparent governance. Sustainable resource management through adaptive governance and ecosystem-based management can reduce food and nutritional risks, conflict, and livelihood loss. Public policies, including subsidies, green procurement, and investment in sustainable value chains, can enhance adaptation effectiveness. Integrating youth innovation and Indigenous knowledge with scientific knowledge will support effective adaptation. Policies must consider equity and participation to avoid increasing vulnerability and impeding sustainable development, with attention to the negative implications of large-scale land acquisitions without sufficient stakeholder participation.
