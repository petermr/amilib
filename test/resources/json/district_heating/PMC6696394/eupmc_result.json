The current level of district heating technology dictates a need for higher supply temperatures, which is not the case when considering the future outlook. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that current networks are being controlled by operator experience and outdoor temperatures. The prospects of reducing network temperatures can be evaluated by developing a dynamic model of the process which can then be used for control purposes. Two scenarios are presented in this work, to not only evaluate a controller's performance in supplying lower network temperatures, but to also assess the boundaries of the return temperature. In Scenario 1, the historical load is used as a feed-forward signal to the controller, and in Scenario 2, a load prediction model is used as the feed-forward signal. The findings for both scenarios suggest that the new control approach can lead to a load reduction of 12.5% and 13.7% respectively for the heat being supplied to the network. With the inclusion of predictions with increased accuracy on end-user demand and feed-back, the return temperature values can be better sustained, and can lead to a decrease in supply temperatures and an increase in energy savings on the production side.", "affiliation": "Department of Automation in Energy and Environment, School of Business, Society and Engineering, M\u00e4lardalen University, Box 883, 721 23 V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden. nathan.zimmerman@mdh.se.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "2016-02395", "agency": "VINNOVA", "orderIn": "0"}}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Control", "energy savings", "Mpc", "Dynamic Modelling", "District Heating", "Dhn", "Feed-forward"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/12/15/2465/pdf?version=1564744321"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12152465"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6696394"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6696394?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2019-08-07", "firstIndexDate": "2019-08-06", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2020-10-01", "electronicPublicationDate": "2019-08-02", "firstPublicationDate": "2019-08-02"}
