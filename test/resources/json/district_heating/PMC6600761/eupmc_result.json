However, it is difficult to apply CP to a pipeline for district heating distribution systems, because the pipeline has thermally insulated coatings which could disturb the CP. Theoretical calculation and field tests alone are not enough for a reliable CP design, and therefore additional CP design methods such as computational analysis should be used. In this study, the CP design for pre-insulated pipelines is tested considering several environmental factors, such as temperature and coating defect ratio. Additionally, computational analysis is performed to verify and optimize the CP design. The simulation results based on theoretical methods alone failed to satisfy the CP criteria. Then, a re-design is conducted considering the IR drop. Consequently, all of the simulation results of defective pipelines satisfied the CP criteria after adding the proper CP current.", "affiliation": "School of Advanced Materials Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 300 Chunchun-Dong, Jangan-Gu, Suwon 440-746, Korea. smith803@skku.edu.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Simulation", "Cathodic protection", "Corrosion Mitigation Method", "Potentiodynamic Polarization Test", "Pre-insulated Pipeline"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/12/11/1761/pdf?version=1559209338"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12111761"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6600761"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6600761?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "4", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2019-06-02", "firstIndexDate": "2019-06-01", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-12", "dateOfRevision": "2020-10-01", "electronicPublicationDate": "2019-05-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2019-05-30"}
