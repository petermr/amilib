In the Nordic region, Sweden has emerged as a global hub, attracting leading technology companies like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. Server halls of DCs are energy intensive buildings, which puts pressure on local water resources and contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to, firstly, quantify the environmental impact of DCs, based on energy usage, water consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Secondly, it develops a planning tool by employing a multi-criteria approach to optimally locate new DCs and to assess the site suitability of existing ones in Sweden. Data of various performance indicators (geographical data on renewable energy accessibility, free cooling conditions, excess heat receivers, and resilience to water shortages) of DCs was collected through different means, e.g., questionnaire surveys, permit applications, company websites, and other open online data repositories. ArcGIS Pro was employed for spatial analysis, and 68 DCs with a site suitability index (SSI)\u00a0\u2264\u00a045\u00a0% were identified as less ideally located. The principal findings are centered on Sweden, and thereby primarily benefit stakeholders engaged in decision-making for evaluating existing or strategic planning of new DCs by incorporating a comprehensive environmental perspective. Given the rapidly changing climate, strategically siting DCs will become crucial for minimizing the sector's environmental impact.", "affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, Linnaeus University, Sweden.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Information And Communication Technology", "Data Center", "Environmental Footprints", "Electricity Usage", "Sustainable Siting Of Dcs"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31290"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11140606"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11140606?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-06-03", "firstIndexDate": "2024-06-04", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-06-03", "dateOfRevision": "2024-06-04", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-05-18", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-05-18"}
