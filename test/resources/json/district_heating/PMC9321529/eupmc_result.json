Measurement data of 22 real events was analyzed for localization, but suitable results were not always achieved. In this paper, the reasons are investigated and a model for data evaluation (MoFoDatEv) is developed for further insights. This contains prior knowledge and a simplified physical model for the reaction of the DHN in the case of a large spontaneous leakage. A model like this does not exist so far. It determines the time point and the duration of the pressure drop of the pressure wave which is caused by such leakages. Both parameters and the evaluation time frame are optimized for each event separately. The quality assessment leads to a categorization of the events based on several parameters, and correlations between the pressure and the refill mass flow are found. A minimum leakage size is deduced for successful evaluation. Furthermore, MoFoDatEv can also be used for leakage localization directly, combining two steps from previous publications. Therefore, more data contribute to the result. The application is conducted with artificial data to prove the model concept, and also with real measurement data.", "affiliation": "Institute for Information Engineering, Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, Salzdahlumer Str. 46/48, 38302 Wolfenbuttel, Germany.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "03ET1624 C", "agency": "Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "03ET1624 B", "agency": "Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "03ET1624 B and C", "agency": "Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Heating"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Sensors", "Data analysis", "Quality assessment", "Measurement Data", "District Heating Network", "Leakage Localization"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/14/5300/pdf?version=1657883249"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s22145300"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9321529"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9321529?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2022-07-28", "dateOfCreation": "2022-07-27", "firstIndexDate": "2022-07-28", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2022-07-29", "dateOfRevision": "2022-07-31", "electronicPublicationDate": "2022-07-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-07-15"}
