To evaluate the corrosion properties, potentiodynamic tests were conducted and a galvanostatic test was used to accelerate corrosion. Tensile tests and microstructure observations were performed to figure out the degradation of the corroded region, and stress intensity factors were calculated. As a result of the potentiodynamic tests, welded carbon steel pipe showed uniform corrosion and the total charge was calculated. Using the galvanostatic test, the current density at the equivalent aging time was applied to the specimens. The tensile tests showed that according to corrosion damages, mechanical properties were degraded due to corrosion. Through the microstructure observations and calculations of stress intensity factors, the corrosion of the welded carbon steel pipe induced the degradation of mechanical properties. The mode of fracture was changed from ductile to brittle fracture with increasing aging time.", "affiliation": "School of Advanced Materials Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066, Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon 16419, Korea.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Carbon steel", "Corrosion", "Mechanical properties", "Welding"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/12/22/3682/pdf?version=1573205289"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ma12223682"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6888080"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6888080?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2019-11-14", "firstIndexDate": "2019-11-14", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2019-11-08", "firstPublicationDate": "2019-11-08"}
