Energy costs go up depending on increasing heat loss in DHS's distribution network. Heat loss from the network consists of 5-20% of transferred energy, and this loss is higher than the other losses in the heating system. In the study, heat losses from the pipes such as supply-return pipes, hot water and circulation pipes into heat canals are investigated based on energy, exergy, economic and environmental. Optimum insulation thicknesses, energy savings, reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the first investment costs and payback periods of the pipes in the network of all-generation district heating systems are investigated by using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) method for fuel types like natural gas, fuel oil and coal. Optimum insulation thicknesses are calculated for different nominal sizes of pipes and various insulation materials such as glass wool, and rock wool for the different climatic zones. According to the results of the study, the heat losses from pipes in the 4th generation DHS network are decreased between 38.19% and 33.33% from the warmest climate zone to the coldest climate zone according to the 3rd generation. Energy savings, reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, payback periods and optimum insulation thickness values of supply and return pipes in the network are respectively changed between 7.80-98.86 $/m, 39.61-322.32 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/year, 0.028-0.38 years and 0.025-0.0105 m depending on various fuel types, insulation materials, nominal size pipes, climatic zones and all generation types.", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Engineering and Natural Sciences Faculty, 162318Gumushane University, 29100, Gumushane, Turkey.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["District Heating Network", "Ltdh Network", "Life-cycle Cost Analysis (Lcca)", "Optimum Insulation Thickness", "Reduction Of Co2 Emisisons"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504221122287"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504221122287"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10358625"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10358625?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by-nc", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2022-09-01", "firstIndexDate": "2022-09-01", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-08-19", "dateOfRevision": "2023-08-10", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-07-01"}
