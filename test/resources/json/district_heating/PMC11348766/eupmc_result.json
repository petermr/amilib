A more convenient warm compresses will\u00a0help improve the patient compliance. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the disposable eyelid warming masks for treatment of dry eye disease (DED) due to MGD.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a randomized, controlled, non-masked, two-center clinical trial. One hundred and forty-four patients were treated by the masks or the hot towel twice daily for 12\u00a0weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 4-week and 12-week visits for subjective symptoms, objective signs and safety assessments, including ocular symptom scores, ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear break-up time (BUT), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), Schirmer I test (SIT), meibum quality, meibum expressibility, and adverse events (AEs).<h4>Results</h4>A totle of 134 patients were followed in the study. The mean age of the masks group (14 males and 52 females) and the hot towel group (20 males and 48 females) was 43.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5\u00a0years and 39.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9\u00a0years, respectively. At 4-week visit, there were significant statistical differences in ocular symptom scores, OSDI and CFS between two groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Except for SIT, the treatment group showed a greater improvement in subjective symptoms and objective signs than the control group at 12-week visit. (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, 40 AEs occurred in 27 patients (37.5%) in the treatment group, and 34 AEs occurred in 21 patients (29.17%) in the control group. No\u00a0serious\u00a0AEs\u00a0were\u00a0reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The masks had a good efficacy and safety in the treatment of DED due to MGD, and might offer an attractive treatment option for some patients.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The study was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900025443) on August 26, 2019.", "affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.725 South Wanping Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai, 200032, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Meibomian Glands"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Tears", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PH", "qualifierName": "physiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Dry Eye Syndromes", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "PP", "qualifierName": "physiopathology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Hyperthermia, Induced", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AE", "qualifierName": "adverse effects", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "IS", "qualifierName": "instrumentation", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Disposable Equipment"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Masks", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AE", "qualifierName": "adverse effects", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Meibomian Gland Dysfunction", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "TH", "qualifierName": "therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Patient Compliance", "Dry Eye Disease", "Meibomian Gland Dysfunction", "Warm Compresses", "Eyelid Warming Masks"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-024-03642-z"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11348766"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11348766?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "PPR839722", "source": "PPR", "type": "Preprint in", "note": "CrossRef Pre-print loader", "orderIn": "10002"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc-nd", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-08-26", "dateOfCreation": "2024-08-26", "firstIndexDate": "2024-08-28", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-08-29", "dateOfRevision": "2024-08-29", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-08-26", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-08-26"}
