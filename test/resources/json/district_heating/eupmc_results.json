			"abstractText": "Heat networks play a vital role in the energy sector by offering thermal energy to residents in certain countries. Effective management and optimization of heat networks require a deep understanding of users' heat usage patterns. Irregular patterns, such as peak usage periods, can exceed the design capacities of the system. However, previous work has mostly neglected the analysis of heat usage profiles or performed on a small scale. To close the gap, this study proposes a data-driven approach to analyze and predict heat load in a district heating network. The study uses data from over eight heating seasons of a cogeneration DH plant in Cheongju, Korea, to build analysis and forecast models using supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), boosting algorithms, and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The models take weather data, holiday information, and historical hourly heat load as input variables. The performance of these algorithms is compared using different training sample sizes of the dataset. The results show that boosting algorithms, particularly XGBoost, are more suitable ML algorithms with lower prediction errors than SVR and MLP. Finally, different explainable artificial intelligence approaches are applied to provide an in-depth interpretation of the trained model and the importance of input variables.",

In this study, the relationship between corrosion factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and operating time and corrosion depth was investigated using the Box-Behnken method within the response surface methodology. To accelerate the corrosion process, galvanostatic tests were conducted in synthetic district heating water. Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was performed using the measured corrosion depth to derive a formula for predicting the corrosion depth as a function of the corrosion factors. As a result, the following regression formula was derived for predicting the corrosion depth: \"corrosion depth (μm) = -133 + 17.1 pH + 0.00072 DO + 125.2 Time - 7.95 pH × Time + 0.002921 DO × Time\".",

Measurement data of 22 real events was analyzed for localization, but suitable results were not always achieved. In this paper, the reasons are investigated and a model for data evaluation (MoFoDatEv) is developed for further insights. This contains prior knowledge and a simplified physical model for the reaction of the DHN in the case of a large spontaneous leakage. A model like this does not exist so far. It determines the time point and the duration of the pressure drop of the pressure wave which is caused by such leakages. Both parameters and the evaluation time frame are optimized for each event separately. The quality assessment leads to a categorization of the events based on several parameters, and correlations between the pressure and the refill mass flow are found. A minimum leakage size is deduced for successful evaluation. Furthermore, MoFoDatEv can also be used for leakage localization directly, combining two steps from previous publications. Therefore, more data contribute to the result. The application is conducted with artificial data to prove the model concept, and also with real measurement data.",

			"abstractText": "District heating systems are provided solutions for the increasing energy problems in high-population cities. Energy costs go up depending on increasing heat loss in DHS's distribution network. Heat loss from the network consists of 5-20% of transferred energy, and this loss is higher than the other losses in the heating system. In the study, heat losses from the pipes such as supply-return pipes, hot water and circulation pipes into heat canals are investigated based on energy, exergy, economic and environmental. Optimum insulation thicknesses, energy savings, reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the first investment costs and payback periods of the pipes in the network of all-generation district heating systems are investigated by using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) method for fuel types like natural gas, fuel oil and coal. Optimum insulation thicknesses are calculated for different nominal sizes of pipes and various insulation materials such as glass wool, and rock wool for the different climatic zones. According to the results of the study, the heat losses from pipes in the 4th generation DHS network are decreased between 38.19% and 33.33% from the warmest climate zone to the coldest climate zone according to the 3rd generation. Energy savings, reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, payback periods and optimum insulation thickness values of supply and return pipes in the network are respectively changed between 7.80-98.86 $/m, 39.61-322.32 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/year, 0.028-0.38 years and 0.025-0.0105 m depending on various fuel types, insulation materials, nominal size pipes, climatic zones and all generation types.",

			"abstractText": "Nowadays, the winter is getting harsher and harsher in Northern China. Thus, the centralized heating systems (CHSs) are playing even more irreplaceable, essential and critical roles in ensuring general public’s livelihood than never ever before. CHSs are normally composed of one or several combined heat and power (CHP) plants (units) and an extensive vein like district heating networks (DHNs) connecting with chemical plants, paper mills, food processing factories, hospitals, hotels, universities, prisons and residential complexes. A CHP plant in Northern China usually consumes coal to heat the cold water into steam to drive high-pressure turbines and low pressure turbines to generate electricity. Then the low-temperature steam is used to heat up the cold water in a main pipe into hot water travelling through the DHNs to provide heat to each end nodes. The returned water will be heated again for reuse and the surplus steam will be released into air through cooling towers. In 2020, China promised to the world that carbon dioxide will peak in 2030 and net-zero emission will happen in 2060. On the one hand, CHP plants need to guarantee enough hot water flowing within each household’s heating radiator. On the other hand, they should cut down on the consumption on non-renewable resources. Lowering water temperature, adjusting water volume and reducing water pressure will all contribute to energy-saving purpose. Lowering water temperature and reducing water pressure may cause too much heat losses during long-distance transmission in frigid winter. Therefore, a reasonable water volume adjustment becomes an advisable action comparatively. Here, we transfer the hot water supply volume optimization problem (HWSVOP) into a heat exchange station (HES) valve angle adjustment problem (SHWESVAAP). Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is established considering balancing the satisfactory degree of each household in residential quarters and the hot water volume (HWV) in the main pipe. And a hybrid polar bear optimization algorithm integrated with chemical reaction optimization (HA-PBO-CRO) is designed to optimize the valve angle (VA) in each HES. The comparative results between HA-PBO-CRO and non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) demonstrate HA-PBO-CRO is superior to NSGAII with better Pareto frontiers on one hand and provide a critical reference supporting the management in a CHP plant to make a right decision on what to do to cut energy consumption while satisfying customers’ needs.",

			"abstractText": "The study proposes a method for preliminary and estimative sizing of the main components of solar district heating systems, with seasonal thermal storage. The main parameters determined by this method, are the aperture area of the solar thermal collectors and the volume of the seasonal thermal storage. The proposed method is only estimative, but it provides the necessary input data for the investigation ofthe dynamic thermal behavior of such systems. The main advantage of the method is that it requires only very few and accessible input data. Two situations are considered: the first in which available climatic data such as annual global solar radiation on horizontal plane and annual average temperature can be used in calculations, and the second in which such data is not available and should be determined through interpolation. With the proposed interpolation functions the annual global solar radiation on horizontal plane, the annual average temperature and the annual global efficiency of the solar thermal collectors were determined. The errors of the estimations are ranging within the intervals of (-15.6 … +25.8) % for annual global solar radiation on horizontal plane and (-10.8 … 19.1) % for annual global efficiency of the solar thermal collectors. The maximum deviations for the annual average temperature estimations were (-4.23 … +5.37) °C. With this limited accuracy, the proposed interpolation functions can be used for latitudes between (0-70) °, annual global solar radiation on horizontal plane between (704-2337) kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/year and annual average temperatures ranging within the interval of (2-30) °C.",

However, there has been no study on the effect of imidazole in alkaline conditions such as a local district water heating environment. Therefore, in this study, the effect of imidazole as a corrosion inhibitor on carbon steel weldment was investigated in alkaline district heating water. Inhibition efficiency and electrochemical properties were investigated by potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As the concentration of imidazole increased up to 500 ppm, inhibition efficiency increased up to 91.7%. At 1000 ppm, inhibition efficiency decreased. Atomic force microscopy showed that surface coverage of imidazole at 1000 ppm is lower than that of imidazole at 500 ppm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that with 500 ppm of imidazole, the amount of pyrrole type interaction is 4.8 times larger than pyridine type interaction. At 1000 ppm of imidazole, the amount of pyridine type interaction is 3.49 times larger than pyrrole type interaction. Depending on the concentration of imidazole, the ratio of interaction between carbon steel and imidazole affected inhibition efficiency.",

To evaluate the corrosion properties, potentiodynamic tests were conducted and a galvanostatic test was used to accelerate corrosion. Tensile tests and microstructure observations were performed to figure out the degradation of the corroded region, and stress intensity factors were calculated. As a result of the potentiodynamic tests, welded carbon steel pipe showed uniform corrosion and the total charge was calculated. Using the galvanostatic test, the current density at the equivalent aging time was applied to the specimens. The tensile tests showed that according to corrosion damages, mechanical properties were degraded due to corrosion. Through the microstructure observations and calculations of stress intensity factors, the corrosion of the welded carbon steel pipe induced the degradation of mechanical properties. The mode of fracture was changed from ductile to brittle fracture with increasing aging time.",

			"abstractText": "The focus of this work is to present the feasibility of lowering the supply and return temperatures of district heating networks in order to achieve energy savings through the implementation of feed-forward model predictive control. The current level of district heating technology dictates a need for higher supply temperatures, which is not the case when considering the future outlook. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that current networks are being controlled by operator experience and outdoor temperatures. The prospects of reducing network temperatures can be evaluated by developing a dynamic model of the process which can then be used for control purposes. Two scenarios are presented in this work, to not only evaluate a controller's performance in supplying lower network temperatures, but to also assess the boundaries of the return temperature. In Scenario 1, the historical load is used as a feed-forward signal to the controller, and in Scenario 2, a load prediction model is used as the feed-forward signal. The findings for both scenarios suggest that the new control approach can lead to a load reduction of 12.5% and 13.7% respectively for the heat being supplied to the network. With the inclusion of predictions with increased accuracy on end-user demand and feed-back, the return temperature values can be better sustained, and can lead to a decrease in supply temperatures and an increase in energy savings on the production side.",

The required temperature of the sanitary hot water (SHW) was set to 50 °C. The main objective of this study was to compare the exergy efficiencies of a DHS without a booster to DHSs with three different types of boosters, i.e., electric-, gas-boiler- and heat-pump-based, during the winter and summer seasons. To achieve this, we developed a generalized model for the calculation of the exergy efficiency of a DHS with or without the booster. The results show that during the winter season, for a very low relative share of SHW production, the DHS without the booster exhibits favorable exergy efficiencies compared to the DHSs with boosters. By increasing this share, an intersection point above 45 °C for the supply temperatures, at which the higher exergy efficiency of a DHS with a booster prevails, can be identified. In the summer season the results show that a DHS without a booster at a supply temperature above 70 °C achieves lower exergy efficiencies compared to DHSs with boosters at supply temperatures above 40 °C. The results also show that ultra-low supply and return temperatures should be avoided for the DHSs with boosters, due to higher rates of entropy generation.",

However, it is difficult to apply CP to a pipeline for district heating distribution systems, because the pipeline has thermally insulated coatings which could disturb the CP. Theoretical calculation and field tests alone are not enough for a reliable CP design, and therefore additional CP design methods such as computational analysis should be used. In this study, the CP design for pre-insulated pipelines is tested considering several environmental factors, such as temperature and coating defect ratio. Additionally, computational analysis is performed to verify and optimize the CP design. The simulation results based on theoretical methods alone failed to satisfy the CP criteria. Then, a re-design is conducted considering the IR drop. Consequently, all of the simulation results of defective pipelines satisfied the CP criteria after adding the proper CP current.",

If sensor resources can be shared and re-used in a variety of applications, the cost of sensors and installation can be reduced, and their functionality and operability can be increased. In this paper, we present a new concept of district heating substation control and monitoring, where a service oriented architecture (SOA) is deployed in a wireless sensor network (WSN), which is integrated with the substation. IP-networking is exclusively used from sensor to server; hence, no middleware is needed for Internet integration. Further, by enabling thousands of sensors with SOA capabilities, a System of Systems approach can be applied. The results of this paper show that it is possible to utilize SOA solutions with heavily resource-constrained embedded devices in contexts where the real-time constrains are limited, such as in a district heating substation.",

Based on a fixed-effect model focusing on Beijing, this study found that after the onset of air pollution, daily clinic visits, hospitalization days, and hospitalization expenses increased several days after the occurrence of air pollution. These hospitalization changes were observed in males and females and three different age groups. A difference-in-differences (DID) model was constructed to identify the influences of cleaner heating policies on health consequences. The study revealed that the policy positively affects health outcomes, with an average decrease of 3.28 thousand clinic visits for all diseases. The total hospitalization days and expenses tend to decrease by 0.22 thousand days and 0.34 million CNY (Chinese Yuan), respectively. Furthermore, implementing the policy significantly reduced the number of daily clinic visits for respiratory diseases, asthma, stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs).",

This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and the risk of COPD incident.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was based on the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) project in Wuzhong District, Suzhou. A total of 45,484 adults aged 30-79 were included in the analysis during 2004-2008. We used Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the association between SES and the risk of COPD. Household income, education, private property and consumption potential was used to measure SES. Incident COPD cases were ascertained using hospitalization records, death certificates, and active follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 524 COPD cases were identified during a median follow-up of 11.2 years. Household income was inversely associated with the risk of COPD (P<sub>trend</sub><0.005). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident COPD were 0.88 (0.69-1.14), 0.77 (0.60-0.99), and 0.42 (0.31-0.57) for participants with annual household income of 10,000 ~ 19,999 yuan, 20,000 ~ 34,999 yuan and ≥ 35,000 yuan respectively, in comparison to participants with an annual household income < 10,000 yuan. Furthermore, we found that education level, refrigerator use, private toilet, private phone, and motor vehicle were adversely associated with COPD risk, while ownership of newly renovated flats was positively correlated with COPD incident.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This prospective study suggests that SES is associated with the risk of COPD in Chinese adults. Population-based COPD prevention strategies tailored for people with different SES could help reduce the burden of COPD in Chinese.",

The dataset consists of measurements of occupancy, indoor environmental quality, room-level and system-level heating, ventilation and lighting operation at a 5 min resolution. The indoor environmental quality and building system data were collected from the building management system. The occupancy level in each monitored room is established from the computer vision-based analysis of wall-mounted camera footage of each office. The number of people present in the room is estimated using the <i>YOLOv5s</i> image recognition algorithm. The present dataset can be used for occupancy analysis, indoor environmental quality investigations, machine learning, and model predictive control.",

			"abstractText": "The impact of COVID-19 has boosted growth in the takeaway and medical industries but has also generated a large amount of plastic waste. Peanut shells (PS) are produced in large quantities and are challenging to recycle in China. Co-pyrolysis of peanut shells (PS) and polypropylene (PP) is an effective method for processing plastic waste and energy mitigation. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted on PS, PP, and their blends (PS-PP) at different heating rates (10, 20, 30 °C·min<sup>-1</sup>). The results illustrated that the co-pyrolysis process of PS-PP was divided into two distinct decomposition stages. The first stage (170-400 °C) was predominantly linked to PS decomposition. The second stage (400-520 °C) resulted from the combinations of PS and PP's thermal degradations, with the most contribution from PP degradation. With the increase in heating rate, thermogravimetric hysteresis appeared. Kinetic analysis indicated that the co-pyrolysis process reduced the individual pyrolysis activation energy, especially in the second stage, with a correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) generally maintained above 0.95. The multi-level reaction mechanism function model can effectively reveal the co-pyrolysis process mechanism. PS proved to be high-quality biomass for co-pyrolysis with PP, and all mixtures exhibited synergistic effects at a mixing ratio of 1:1 (PS1-PP1). This study accomplished effective waste utilization and optimized energy consumption. It holds significance in determining the interaction mechanism of mixed samples in the co-pyrolysis process.",

			"abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Warm compresses are the routine treatment for Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) in daily life, but in order to achieve satisfactory efficacy, the treatment needs to be sustained over a long time, which can have an impact on the patient compliance. A more convenient warm compresses will help improve the patient compliance. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the disposable eyelid warming masks for treatment of dry eye disease (DED) due to MGD.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a randomized, controlled, non-masked, two-center clinical trial. One hundred and forty-four patients were treated by the masks or the hot towel twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 4-week and 12-week visits for subjective symptoms, objective signs and safety assessments, including ocular symptom scores, ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear break-up time (BUT), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), Schirmer I test (SIT), meibum quality, meibum expressibility, and adverse events (AEs).<h4>Results</h4>A totle of 134 patients were followed in the study. The mean age of the masks group (14 males and 52 females) and the hot towel group (20 males and 48 females) was 43.7 ± 13.5 years and 39.5 ± 13.9 years, respectively. At 4-week visit, there were significant statistical differences in ocular symptom scores, OSDI and CFS between two groups (P < 0.05). Except for SIT, the treatment group showed a greater improvement in subjective symptoms and objective signs than the control group at 12-week visit. (P < 0.05). In addition, 40 AEs occurred in 27 patients (37.5%) in the treatment group, and 34 AEs occurred in 21 patients (29.17%) in the control group. No serious AEs were reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The masks had a good efficacy and safety in the treatment of DED due to MGD, and might offer an attractive treatment option for some patients.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The study was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900025443) on August 26, 2019.",

We developed an on-site testing platform that utilizes a centrifugal microfluidic chip and automated device to achieve high-throughput detection. The low-power (<32 W), portable (220 mm × 220 mm × 170 mm, 4 kg) device can complete bacterial lysis, nucleic acid extraction and purification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction, and real-time fluorescence detection. Magnetic beads for nucleic acid adsorption can be mixed by applying electromagnetic fields and centrifugal forces, and the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction is improved by 60% compared to the no-mixing group. The automated nucleic acid extraction process achieves equivalent nucleic acid extraction efficiency in only 40% of the time consumed using the kit protocol. By designing the valve system and disc layout, the maximum speed required for the centrifugal microfluidic chip is reduced to 1500 rpm, greatly reducing the equipment power consumption and size. In detecting <i>E. coli</i>, our platform achieves a limit of detection (LOD) of 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL in 60 min. In summary, our active centrifugal microfluidic platform provides a solution for the integration of complex biological assays on turntables, with great potential in the application of point-of-care diagnosis.",

			"abstractText": "This paper aims to enhance the design and operation of a Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) system utilizing a gas engine as the primary energy source for a residential building in China. An Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environment (4E) analysis is employed to assess the system's performance and impact based on energy, exergy, economic, and environmental criteria. The effectiveness of the DNGO algorithm is evaluated on a case study site and compared with Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The findings demonstrate that the DNGO algorithm identifies the optimal gas engine size of 130 kW. The algorithm's search capabilities are greatly enhanced by this unique blend, surpassing what traditional methods can offer. The DNGO algorithm brings several advantages, including unparalleled energy efficiency, reduced exergy destruction, and a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions. This not only supports environmental sustainability but also aligns with global standards. Economically, the algorithm enhances the performance of the CCHP system, evident through a reduced payback period and increased annual profit. Additionally, the algorithm's rapid convergence rate allows it to reach the optimal solution faster than its counterparts, making it advantageous for time-sensitive applications. Incorporating innovative methods like chaos theory, the DNGO algorithm effectively avoids local optima, enabling a broader search for the best solution. The utilization of Lévy flight further enhances the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and navigate the search space more efficiently. Additionally, swarm intelligence is employed to simulate the collective behavior of decentralized systems, aiding in problem-solving. This research represents a significant advancement in optimization techniques for CCHP systems and offers a fresh perspective to the field of swarm-based optimization algorithms.",

			"abstractText": "The global data center (DC) sector has expanded rapidly during the last decades, due to the rising demand for digital services. In the Nordic region, Sweden has emerged as a global hub, attracting leading technology companies like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. Server halls of DCs are energy intensive buildings, which puts pressure on local water resources and contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to, firstly, quantify the environmental impact of DCs, based on energy usage, water consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Secondly, it develops a planning tool by employing a multi-criteria approach to optimally locate new DCs and to assess the site suitability of existing ones in Sweden. Data of various performance indicators (geographical data on renewable energy accessibility, free cooling conditions, excess heat receivers, and resilience to water shortages) of DCs was collected through different means, e.g., questionnaire surveys, permit applications, company websites, and other open online data repositories. ArcGIS Pro was employed for spatial analysis, and 68 DCs with a site suitability index (SSI) ≤ 45 % were identified as less ideally located. The principal findings are centered on Sweden, and thereby primarily benefit stakeholders engaged in decision-making for evaluating existing or strategic planning of new DCs by incorporating a comprehensive environmental perspective. Given the rapidly changing climate, strategically siting DCs will become crucial for minimizing the sector's environmental impact.",
