especially for early diagnosis of infectious diseases and preventing the spread of infection. We developed an on-site testing platform that utilizes a centrifugal microfluidic chip and automated device to achieve high-throughput detection. The low-power (<32 W), portable (220 mm \u00d7 220 mm \u00d7 170 mm, 4 kg) device can complete bacterial lysis, nucleic acid extraction and purification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction, and real-time fluorescence detection. Magnetic beads for nucleic acid adsorption can be mixed by applying electromagnetic fields and centrifugal forces, and the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction is improved by 60% compared to the no-mixing group. The automated nucleic acid extraction process achieves equivalent nucleic acid extraction efficiency in only 40% of the time consumed using the kit protocol. By designing the valve system and disc layout, the maximum speed required for the centrifugal microfluidic chip is reduced to 1500 rpm, greatly reducing the equipment power consumption and size. In detecting <i>E. coli</i>, our platform achieves a limit of detection (LOD) of 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL in 60 min. In summary, our active centrifugal microfluidic platform provides a solution for the integration of complex biological assays on turntables, with great potential in the application of point-of-care diagnosis.", "affiliation": "School of Medical Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, 5 South Zhongguancun Street, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "(No. JCKY2021602B009)", "agency": "This research was funded by the Defense Industrial Technology Development Program", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Escherichia coli", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "IP", "qualifierName": "isolation & purification", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Centrifugation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biosensing Techniques"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Lab-On-A-Chip Devices"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Device", "LAMP", "Coriolis Force", "Nucleic Acid Extraction", "Centrifugal Microfluidic Chip", "Hydrophobic Valve", "Siphon Valve", "Paraffin Valve"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/14/6/313/pdf?version=1718789661"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/bios14060313"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11202104"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11202104?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-06-26", "dateOfCreation": "2024-06-26", "firstIndexDate": "2024-06-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-06-28", "dateOfRevision": "2024-06-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-06-19", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-06-19"}
