We developed an on-site testing platform that utilizes a centrifugal microfluidic chip and automated device to achieve high-throughput detection. The low-power (&#x0003c;32 W), portable (220 mm &#x000d7; 220 mm &#x000d7; 170 mm, 4 kg) device can complete bacterial lysis, nucleic acid extraction and purification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction, and real-time fluorescence detection. Magnetic beads for nucleic acid adsorption can be mixed by applying electromagnetic fields and centrifugal forces, and the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction is improved by 60% compared to the no-mixing group. The automated nucleic acid extraction process achieves equivalent nucleic acid extraction efficiency in only 40% of the time consumed using the kit protocol. By designing the valve system and disc layout, the maximum speed required for the centrifugal microfluidic chip is reduced to 1500 rpm, greatly reducing the equipment power consumption and size.

Introduction</title><p>The outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by pathogens have increased the demand for POCT for public health monitoring. Recently, miniaturized molecular diagnostic platforms have been designed for on-site testing and various microfluidic technologies, with the inherent benefits of compact nature, small reagent consumption, and precise and automatic fluid control. They can be assembled in various functional designs, and have been developed for pathogen detection [<xref rid="B1-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among them, the centrifugal microfluidic platform is an ideal technology that has been developed in recent years for POCT DNA detection [<xref rid="B4-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The centrifugal microfluidic chip focuses more on the ability to integrate nucleic acid extraction and analysis [<xref rid="B6-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Integrated chips have the advantage of composite functionality and can also reduce the amount of chips used and the time and operations required for detection. The integrated chip has good sealing, which is conducive to avoiding contamination that may occur when the reagents are transferred and improving the anti-interference ability of on-site pathogenic microbial detection. Although quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the gold standard for nucleic acid testing, it requires extremely accurate and rapid temperature control, which places extremely high demands on the equipment. To eliminate the necessity of the thermal cycler and simplify operation, the isothermal amplification method is proposed, in which amplification can be accomplished at a constant temperature within a short time [<xref rid="B8-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Integrating centrifugal microfluidic chips with LAMP reactions enables parallel detection and has the advantages of small sample volume requirements, simple reagent loading process, fast speed, high throughput, and high efficiency [<xref rid="B10-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The integration of bacterial lysis, nucleic acid extraction and purification, and nucleic acid detection to establish a centrifugal-driven microfluidic chip system is currently the focus of research on integrated detection equipment. Traditional microfluidic chips rely on bulky syringe pumps, valve actuators, and complex tubing systems for transferring and placing liquids, which makes their processing technology complex, resulting in insufficient efficiency during testing and prolonged testing time [<xref rid="B13-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Compared with traditional pressure-driven methods, centrifugal microfluidic chips have the advantage of higher potential for automation [<xref rid="B14-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, most work to achieve the graded opening of the fluid control circuitry, step up the speed during centrifugation, or maintain centrifugal motion for long periods [<xref rid="B15-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This ultimately leads to excessively high maximum centrifugal speeds and high motor power consumption, taking away from the original intent of instant detection. Therefore, to achieve an integrated automatic detection process, it is necessary to consider the design of chip valves. Centrifugal microfluidics were clarified into two categories: passive centrifugal microfluidics and active centrifugal microfluidics [<xref rid="B16-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, passive valves still have some limitations in terms of performing complex logical operations or time sequencing with more steps, which limits their application on centrifugal microfluidic chips. Centrifugal microfluidic chips in recent years have tended to have a flexible combination of passive/passive valves and active/ciliated valves, finding a balance between stability and simplicity [<xref rid="B17-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These fluid control circuits have achieved good results.</p><p>Furthermore, nucleic acid extraction is the initial and necessary step of nucleic acid testing, and the quality of nucleic acid determines the result. However, due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of sample preprocessing and nucleic acid extraction, the DNA is usually extracted and purified directly outside the chip and added by the micro pipettor. Lander developed an automatable rotationally driven microfluidic device for the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, sample enrichment using Nanotrap magnetic virus particles was conducted off-disc, reducing the automation of the detection process [<xref rid="B18-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, some studies have integrated traditional nucleic acid extraction methods into detection systems but inevitably complicated the equipment, increased sample processing time, and introduced amplification inhibitors. A study developed a portable genetic analyzer with an integrated centrifugal disc, but the extraction efficiency of magnetic beads for nucleic acid was relatively low, and the sample pre-treatment was time-consuming [<xref rid="B19-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The nucleic acid adsorption process based on centrifugal microfluidic chips often employs a membrane [<xref rid="B20-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]/silica column [<xref rid="B21-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]/magnetic bead [<xref rid="B22-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] approach. With more efficient solid&#x02013;liquid mixing efficiency, magnetic beads have been widely used in the on-chip nucleic acid adsorption process. In the project, centrifugal force was skillfully utilized to control the opening of the siphon valve circuit. However, the magnetic beads were bound by the centrifugal force during the adsorption process and could not be actively mixed, which reduced the extraction efficiency and made the process time-consuming.</p><p>This study proposes an integrated and fully automated centrifugal microfluidic chip for the rapid detection of pathogenic microbials. The proposed strategy of active mixing or active collecting of magnetic beads allows nucleic acid extraction on the centrifugal microfluidic chip with the same efficiency as that of the kit while reducing the time consumed by 60%. The automated nucleic acid extraction process of the centrifugal microfluidic chip achieves the same nucleic acid extraction efficiency in 40% of the time required by the kit protocol. By introducing paraffin valves, hydrophobic valves, siphon valves and Coriolis force structure, the on-chip fluid control is accurately accomplished, while the maximum centrifugal rotational speed is controlled at only 1500 rpm. The low-power (&#x0003c;32 W) and portable (220 mm &#x000d7; 220 mm &#x000d7; 170 mm, 4 kg) automation unit contains five modules: centrifugation, heating, electromagnetic field, fluorescence detection, and control system. Within the automated device, the variety flows in the centrifugal microfluidic chip for nucleic acid extraction and the LAMP reaction is fully automated. Our centrifugal microfluidic chip requires only a simple reaction reagent and sample filling, and the remaining steps of the assay are fully automated. We tested this protocol with <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and achieved detection within 60 min. Detection of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in a centrifugal microfluidic chip showed that our system achieved the LOD of 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL for genomic DNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-biosensors-14-00313"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-biosensors-14-00313"><title>2.1. Fabrication of Centrifugal Microfluidic Chips</title><p>The 3-dimensional (3D) model of the centrifugal microfluidic chip was designed using Solidworks 2020. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) has been widely used in the fabrication of centrifugal chips due to PMMA&#x02019;s excellent light transmission and biocompatibility. Five PMMA layers (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) with diameters of 136 mm, 136 mm, 90 mm, 60 mm, and 40 mm were processed using a high-speed precision engraving and milling machine to form functional structures on the front and back of the PMMA layers. These PMMAs were rinsed twice using ddH<sub>2</sub>O and dried in an oven at 60 &#x000b0;C for 3 h. Low-temperature paraffin wax with a melting point of 40 &#x000b0;C was selected and melted at 120 &#x000b0;C; then, 1 &#x003bc;L was taken and added to the paraffin valve and subsequently cooled and solidified at room temperature. The hydrophobic valves and siphon valves were treated using MesoPhobic-2000 (Wuhan Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Wuhan, China) and 0.2% (<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>) Tween-20 (dissolved in anhydrous ethanol), respectively, and dried naturally at room temperature. Finally, five layers of PMMA chips and four layers of pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA, 3M 9969Solventum, St Louis, USA) were sequentially pressed together to form the overall centrifugal microfluidic chip. Screws were fixed onto the edge of the chip to avoid air bubbles that may be generated by the PSA under different temperature conditions. The schematic and photo of the whole machining process are shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-biosensors-14-00313"><title>2.2. Development and Assessment of Automated Devices</title><p>We designed an integrated device for automated work on centrifugal microfluidic chips (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B). For rapid deployment and detection on-site, automation devices should have the advantage of being portable and low-power. The dimensions of the automation device are 220 mm &#x000d7; 220 mm &#x000d7; 170 mm and the weight is 4 kg. The automated device contains a centrifugal module, a heating module, an electromagnetic field module, a fluorescence detection module, and a control system. The centrifugal module consists of a direct current (DC) motor (GA36Y-3530-12100, Xinyongtai, Shenzhen, China) with a photoelectric switch. The heating module consists of two pairs of PI (Polyimide) heating membranes and purple copper disks. The electromagnet module consists of eight miniature low-power electromagnets. The fluorescence detection module utilizes a miniature fluorescence detector (MNS-MFD-470, MONAISI, Suzhou, China) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 470 mm and 525 mm. The control module consists of data analysis software, an STM32 microcontroller, power supply, a heating controller (TEC207M, SenseFuture, Shenzhen, China), an electromagnet controller, a DC motor controller, and a pushrod motor. The centrifugation program, the heating program, the magnetic bead mixing/collection program, the fluorescence detection program, and the result-sending program are loaded into the microcontroller unit (MCU).</p><p>Fluid control relies on precise speed control. We set multiple rotational speeds within the maximum speed of the centrifugal chip to examine the linear relationship between the actual rotational speed and the duty ratio of pulse width modulation (PMW). The PWM is generated through the MCU. The actual speed of the centrifugal chips was measured with a hand-held tachometer (DLY-2301; DELIXI, Hangzhou, China). We fitted the data linearly using rotational speed as the horizontal coordinate and the duty ratio of PWM as the vertical coordinate.</p><p>A low-noise fluorescence detector with an accurate response is essential for plotting amplification curves. We set up a concentration gradient of sodium fluorescein solution (0 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.2 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.4 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.6 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.8 &#x003bc;mol/L, and 1 &#x003bc;mol/L) for the purpose of checking the working performance of the fluorescence detector. During fluorescence response signal acquisition, we rotated the centrifugal chip to spin at 60 rpm. After adding ddH<sub>2</sub>O to all amplification chambers, the fluorescence response signals were measured for one week of centrifugal chip spinning using the ADS1256 module on the MCU. The background noise of the detector was calculated from these fluorescence response signals. Subsequently, we fitted the data linearly with the fluorescein sodium concentration as the horizontal coordinate and the fluorescence response signal as the vertical coordinate.</p><p>After initiating automated pathogenic microbial detection, the lysis and amplification reactions have stringent requirements for the accuracy and stability of temperature control. We measured the effect of temperature control for the lysis reaction (56 &#x000b0;C) and the LAMP reaction (65 &#x000b0;C), respectively. Temperature sensors were installed in four lysis chambers and four amplification chambers. We used the MCU to record the temperature sensor for 10 min at 2 Hz when the predetermined temperature is reached. The temperature records were then evaluated, and time&#x02013;temperature curves were plotted.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the power consumption of the automation device using a power meter, and the results were used to confirm that the automation device had the advantage of low power consumption.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-biosensors-14-00313"><title>2.3. Nucleic Acid Extraction and LAMP Reaction Program</title><p>We used the product of centrifugation of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in place of samples of pathogenic microbials obtained from the environment. First, 90 &#x003bc;L ATL buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and 10 &#x003bc;L proteinase K (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) were used as lysis reagents. The nucleic acid adsorption reagent consisted of 10 &#x003bc;L of magnetic beads and 140 &#x003bc;L of MB buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A 160 &#x003bc;L sample of ddH<sub>2</sub>O was used as the wash buffer, so disturbance or mixing of the magnetic bead clusters needed to be strictly avoided during the washing process. We used 147 &#x003bc;L of LAMP cocktail (<xref rid="app1-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>) as nucleic acid elution buffer. Each amplification chamber contained 3.2 &#x003bc;L of LAMP primer mixture (<xref rid="app1-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the reaction process of detecting actual samples in a centrifugal microfluidic chip. (i) We resuspended the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> precipitate using the lysis reagent. (ii) The lysis process involved heating the sample for 20 min at 56 &#x000b0;C. (iii) The lysis process product, MB buffer, and magnetic beads were thoroughly mixed and incubated for 1 min to adsorb nucleic acids. (iv) We collected the magnetic beads to remove the nucleic acid adsorption waste solution. (v) We kept the collected magnetic beads, added washing buffer, and held for 10 s. (vi) We kept the collected magnetic beads and removed the bead wash waste solution. (vii) The LAMP cocktail was mixed with the magnetic beads and incubated for 1 min to elute the nucleic acids. (viii) We collected the magnetic beads, transferred the LAMP cocktail with nucleic acids, and pre-distributed the LAMP cocktail. (ix) The LAMP primer mixture was added to the pre-distributed LAMP cocktail with nucleic acids. (x) A 35 min LAMP reaction was conducted at 65 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>The bead mixing or collection required in the above steps was achieved by providing centrifugal force and an electromagnetic field to the centrifugal microfluidic chip using our automated device. To achieve bead mixing, we applied alternating rotation (&#x000b1;100 rpm, 2 Hz) and an electromagnetic field to the centrifugal microfluidic chip. Alternating rotation generated a liquid flow to drive the magnetic beads for mixing. Electromagnetic fields helped the beads to overcome gravity and friction for smoother bead movement. To achieve magnetic bead clustering, our magnetic bead clustering procedure consisted of accelerating the centrifugal microfluidic chip from 0 to 300 rpm and holding it for 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-biosensors-14-00313"><title>2.4.

The same volume of lysis product, MB buffer, and magnetic beads were added to the chambers of the experimental and control groups. During nucleic acid adsorption and elution, the magnetic beads of the experimental group were mixed, while the magnetic beads of the control group remained stationary. Finally, we measured the concentrations of both groups of nucleic acids in MicroplateReader (Cytation3, Biotek, WA, USA).</p><p>The efficiency of nucleic acid extraction was compared between the automated protocol and the kit protocol using 100 &#x003bc;L of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL).

Flow Control of the Centrifugal Microfluidic Chip</title><p>The complete process of nucleic acid extraction and LAMP reaction assay consisted of eight solution transfer steps (1#~8#) and twelve states (step 1~step 12). 1# Preloading and lysis: The preloading chambers and the amplification chambers were injected with the reaction reagents (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, step 1); the lysis chambers were injected with the samples (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, step 2); and subsequently, the lysis chamber was heated at 56 &#x000b0;C for 20 min to lyse the sample and melt the paraffin valve. 2# Nucleic acid adsorption: The MB buffer, magnetic beads and lysis products were transferred to the central reaction chamber at 300 rpm; ddH<sub>2</sub>O and LAMP cocktails were transferred from the preloading chamber to the respective storage chambers; and the magnetic beads were mixed in the central reaction chamber using alternating rotation (&#x000b1; 100 rpm, 2 Hz) and an electromagnetic field (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, step 3). 3# Nucleic acid adsorption discharge: Using 300 rpm and electromagnetic force, the magnetic beads in the central reaction chamber were gathered to the side away from the outlet (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, step 4); using &#x02212;600 rpm, the nucleic acid adsorption was discharged to the waste chamber, while allowing the ddH<sub>2</sub>O to breach the hydrophobic valve downstream of the staging chamber. 4# Bead Wash: The chip was allowed to rest and we filled the siphon valve downstream of the hydrophobic valve with ddH<sub>2</sub>O (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, step 5); we then used &#x02212;300 rpm to release the ddH<sub>2</sub>O into the center reaction chamber (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, step 6). 5# Bead Wash Solution Discharge: We drained the bead wash waste solution into the waste chamber using &#x02212;800 rpm while allowing the LAMP cocktail to break through to the waste chamber where it resided.

Performance of Automation Integration Devices</title><p>To realize fully automated nucleic acid extraction and LAMP amplification reactions in a centrifugal microfluidic chip, we built an automated device. The automated device has functions including centrifugation, heating, electromagnetic field, and fluorescence detection. We designed each functional module compactly and tested its working performance.</p><p>Although we ultimately determined that eight specific speeds would be sufficient to drive the fluid for the complete process, the centrifugal module was needed to achieve precise speed control during valve design to determine the actual operating speed of the valve. The centrifugal module for spinning centrifugal microfluidic chips is shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A. The integrated aluminum alloy holder held the DC motor, photoelectric switch, and chip adapter. Precise rotational speed control was achieved by applying PWM (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). The PWM duty ratio had a good linear relationship with rotational speeds between 100 and 1500 rpm. The instantaneous error for each target speed was within &#x000b1;3 rpm. We used photoelectric switches and DC motors to achieve the alternating rotation of the centrifugal chip, which was designed to oscillate the central chamber with the magnetic beads in an area centered on an electromagnet.</p><p>The working position and schematic diagram of the fluorescence detection and the chip are shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D, respectively. The folded optical path makes the detector miniaturized. The excitation light (470 nm) emitted by the LED is converged in the amplification chamber of the chip through the excitation filter, dichroic mirror, and objective lens. The emitted light (525 nm) from the amplification chamber is converged on the surface of the photodetector by means of an objective lens, a dichroic mirror, a detection filter, and a fluorescence collection lens. As shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E, a fluorescence scanning assay was repeated three times after adding ddH<sub>2</sub>O inside the amplification chamber, and the standard deviation of the background signal was calculated to be 0.16 mV, indicating that the fluorescence detection module has a low background noise. Concentration&#x02013;fluorescence response signal curves (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F) were plotted for the test results of sodium fluorescein solutions with gradient concentrations (0 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.2 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.4 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.6 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.8 &#x003bc;mol/L, and 1 &#x003bc;mol/L) in the chip.

These two copper violet disks faced the lysis chamber and amplification chamber inside the centrifugal microfluidic chip, respectively, and the copper disks were in contact with the chip during heating. Temperature monitoring was performed for 10 min (2 Hz) in four lysis chambers and four symmetrically positioned amplification chambers. The temperature inside all four chambers was maintained at 56 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x000b0;C during testing (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>H).

Four of the electromagnets were fixed on the chip slot where they directly faced the central reaction chamber. The other four electromagnets were fixed on an integrated flat plate together with the heating module, and these four electromagnets also directly faced the central reaction chamber.</p><p>The heating module was in contact with the centrifugal microfluidic chip. To ensure that the chip rotated properly, we implemented distance control between the heating&#x02013;electromagnet assembly and the chip (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>K). Thus, the automated device pulled the heating&#x02013;electromagnet assembly in contact with the chip using pushrod motors during the heating processes of the lysis and amplification reaction. During the fluorescence detection processes, which included the liquid drive and amplification reactions, the pusher motor lifted the heater&#x02013;electromagnet assembly and moved it away from the chip.

Discussion</title><p>The transfer of reagents is fully automated; otherwise, an operational burden is created [<xref rid="B24-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Automated reagent transfer relies on integrated valve design. The valves shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrate that the multiple valves integrated into the centrifugal chip enable fluid control while avoiding the use of bulky valves. The paraffin valve is an active valve with a good seal before melting. We provided paraffin valves upstream and downstream of the reagent preloading chamber and the lysis reaction chamber. The additional heat generated by lysis was utilized to open the paraffin valve, avoiding the use of another heater and reducing the amount of passive valve. By connecting a hydrophobic valve and a siphon valve in series downstream of the reagent storage chamber, we combined the valve conditions for reagent release processes with those for waste solution discharge. Specifically, while the waste solution of the previous step was discharged, the reagent for the next step was selected, but not immediately released. When the waste solution was completely discharged, the reagents for the next step were released by centrifugation at a low speed or by keeping stationery. We controlled the flow of solution into the waste chamber or pre-distribution channel using the Coriolis force structure. This is a functional structure that selects the direction of flow by changing the direction of centrifugation. The pre-distribution channel allowed the LAMP cocktail, which contained nucleic acids, to be dispensed. Users can perform multiple LAMP reactions from the same sample. The above design directly helps to fully differentiate between the eight solution transfer steps by only requiring a maximum speed of 1500 rpm. According to <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, these examples of centrifugal microfluidic chips with nucleic acid extraction and amplification for the detection of pathogenic microbials generally require a maximum rotational speed greater than 2500 rpm. However, motors with high rotational speed are large and consume large amounts of power, which is not conducive to the portable design of the automation device and its on-site use. While extraction-free LAMP reactions and active valves have been shown to reduce the maximum operating speed of centrifugal microfluidic chips, they may reduce the reaction efficiency and increase the detection time [<xref rid="B25-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In our on-site centrifugal microfluidic chip for the multiplexed pathogenic microbial detection system, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> was used as the sample for performance testing. We used the lysis reagent from the QIAGEN Magattract HMW DNA Kit, as this allowed for more efficient lysis of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and minimized the inhibition of amplification. The results in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B,C demonstrate that the designed on-chip nucleic acid extraction process did not produce amplification inhibition for either the qPCR or the LAMP reaction.</p><p>Insufficient mixing of magnetic beads was responsible for the inefficient and time-consuming nucleic acid adsorption and elution [<xref rid="B17-biosensors-14-00313" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a centrifugal microfluidic chip, the magnetic beads tend to be deposited on the wall furthest from the axis in the chamber due to centrifugal force. At the same time, due to the small size of the microfluidic chip chamber, the deposited magnetic beads cannot be adequately mixed due to the restricted liquid flow. To overcome these problems, this study provides a magnetic bead control method based on alternating rotation and electromagnetic field control. By increasing the mixing or collection of the magnetic beads, efficient nucleic acid adsorption and elution were thus achieved. None of the cases with magnetic bead mixing within <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> compared the effect of magnetic bead mixing or lack thereof on the nucleic acid extraction efficiency, and we introduced experiments to assess the role of magnetic bead mixing in centrifugal microfluidic chips. According to the results of <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A, we found that the magnetic bead mixing step enhanced the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction by 60% compared to the unmixed control. This suggests that adequate mixing of the magnetic beads in the lysis product is important to verify the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction. We confirmed that our automated protocol requires only 40% of the time of the kit protocol to achieve the same nucleic acid extraction efficiency (<xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>We completed the whole process of nucleic acid extraction and LAMP reaction on a centrifugal microfluidic chip. The results were consistent with the previous nucleic acid extraction experiments and LAMP reaction detection experiments. As shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E, the automated system realized the detection of the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> genome. We performed the whole process of nucleic acid extraction and LAMP reaction in a single channel, and the average CT value of the amplification curves in seven chambers was 14.3 (CV = 7%). These data support the evaluation of the consistency and stability of our centrifugal microfluidic chip and automated device against <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. In further sensitivity experiments, we derived a linear curve of dilution versus fluorescence intensity, as shown in <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F. We calculated the LOD of the system to be 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL. According to <xref rid="biosensors-14-00313-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, our automatic detection system can achieve close detection sensitivity at lower rotational speeds. Our centrifugal microfluidic chip has the potential for multi-target detection because we designed the chip with four channels, each corresponding to seven assay chambers, and we verified the consistency and stability of each chamber by using <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-biosensors-14-00313"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Herein, we report a centrifugal microfluidic chip detection system for on-site multiplexed pathogenic microbial detection. We integrated nucleic acid extraction with LAMP reaction in a centrifugal microfluidic chip. An isolated pathogenic microbial detection space was created on-site. The automated device and the centrifugal microfluidic chip enable fully automated <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> detection. The system has the advantages of portability (220 mm &#x000d7; 220 mm &#x000d7; 170 mm, 4 kg) and low power consumption (&#x0003c;32 W). Automated detection eliminates the requirement for operational expertise and reduces the cost of labor and time. We use the additional heat generated by the lysis to open the paraffin valve. We also designed the flow control system using a variety of passive valves and Coriolis force structures. These efforts reduced the burden of valve design and ultimately resulted in a reduction in the maximum speed of the entire process to 1500 rpm. We attempted to control the magnetic beads through electromagnetic fields and centrifugal force to achieve efficient bead mixing and collection within the reaction chamber. Compared with the control group without mixing magnetic beads, the experimental group that mixed magnetic beads with lysed samples achieved a 60% increase in nucleic acid extraction efficiency. The complete on-chip nucleic acid extraction process achieved the same extraction efficiency in 40% of the time of the kit protocol. The overall duration of our centrifugal microarray was 60 min, and we achieved a detection limit of 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. In the future, we will integrate multiple LAMP detection technologies to achieve higher throughput and more sensitive on-site detection of pathogenic microbials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

Step 1: Indicator reagents for adsorption buffer(blue area in the schematic figure), magnetic beads(brown area in the schematic figure), wash buffer(red area in the schematic figure), and elution buffer(green area in the schematic figure) are preloaded into the preloading chamber. Indicator reagents for primers are preloaded in the amplification chamber. Step 2: Indicator reagents for lysis buffer with samples(yellow area in the schematic figure) are injected into the lysis chamber. Step 3: Indicator reagents for wash buffer and elution buffer are transferred to the storage chamber. The indicator reagents for the binding solution (lysis product, adsorption buffer, magnetic beads) are released into the central reaction chamber and the magnetic beads are mixed using centrifugal force and electromagnetic field. Nucleic acids are adsorbed to the magnetic beads. Step 4: The magnetic beads form agglomerates. Step 5: The adsorbate is transferred to the waste chamber and the wash buffer is allowed to fill the siphon valve. Step 6: The wash buffer is released and the magnetic beads are kept in state. Step 7: The binding solution is transferred to the waste chamber and the elution buffer is allowed to fill the siphon valve. Step 8: The elution buffer is released. Step 9: The centrifugal force and electromagnetic field are used to mix the magnetic beads with the elution buffer. Nucleic acids are released from the magnetic beads into the elution buffer. Step 10: The magnetic beads form agglomerates. Step 11: The elution buffer enters the pre-dispensing channel. Step 12: The elution buffer is mixed with the indicator for the primers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biosensors-14-00313-g004" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="biosensors-14-00313-f005"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Automatic device design.
