"abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>Socioeconomic status (SES) has been proven to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Western populations, but the evidence is very limited in China. This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and the risk of COPD incident.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was based on the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) project in Wuzhong District, Suzhou. A total of 45,484 adults aged 30-79 were included in the analysis during 2004-2008. We used Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the association between SES and the risk of COPD. Household income, education, private property and consumption potential was used to measure SES. Incident COPD cases were ascertained using hospitalization records, death certificates, and active follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 524 COPD cases were identified during a median follow-up of 11.2 years. Household income was inversely associated with the risk of COPD (P<sub>trend</sub><0.005). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident COPD were 0.88 (0.69-1.14), 0.77 (0.60-0.99), and 0.42 (0.31-0.57) for participants with annual household income of 10,000\u2009~\u200919,999 yuan, 20,000\u2009~\u200934,999 yuan and \u2265\u200935,000 yuan respectively, in comparison to participants with an annual household income\u2009<\u200910,000 yuan. Furthermore, we found that education level, refrigerator use, private toilet, private phone, and motor vehicle were adversely associated with COPD risk, while ownership of newly renovated flats was positively correlated with COPD incident.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This prospective study suggests that SES is associated with the risk of COPD in Chinese adults. Population-based COPD prevention strategies tailored for people with different SES could help reduce the burden of COPD in Chinese.", "affiliation": "Department of Non-communicable Chronic Disease Control and Prevention, Suzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suzhou, 215004, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "KJXW2018051", "agency": "Suzhou Science and Technology Bureau Fund for Technology for People", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Qnng2021030", "agency": "National Mentorship training program for Suzhou Youth Health Key Talent", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2016YFC0900500", "agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "202922/Z/16/Z, 088158/Z/09/Z, 104085/Z/14/Z", "agency": "Wellcome Trust", "acronym": "WT_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "Wellcome Trust", "acronym": "WT_", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "82192900, 82192901,82192904\uff0c81390540, 91846303", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "Kadoorie Charitable Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "EP", "qualifierName": "epidemiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Proportional Hazards Models"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "China", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "EP", "qualifierName": "epidemiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["COPD", "Socioeconomic status", "Prospective Cohort Study", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "China Kadoorie Biobank"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-19490-x"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11292937"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11292937?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-08-01", "dateOfCreation": "2024-07-31", "firstIndexDate": "2024-08-01", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-08-05", "dateOfRevision": "2024-08-03", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-07-31", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-07-31"}
