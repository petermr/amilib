An Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environment (4E) analysis is employed to assess the system's performance and impact based on energy, exergy, economic, and environmental criteria. The effectiveness of the DNGO algorithm is evaluated on a case study site and compared with Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The findings demonstrate that the DNGO algorithm identifies the optimal gas engine size of 130\u00a0kW. The algorithm's search capabilities are greatly enhanced by this unique blend, surpassing what traditional methods can offer. The DNGO algorithm brings several advantages, including unparalleled energy efficiency, reduced exergy destruction, and a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions. This not only supports environmental sustainability but also aligns with global standards. Economically, the algorithm enhances the performance of the CCHP system, evident through a reduced payback period and increased annual profit. Additionally, the algorithm's rapid convergence rate allows it to reach the optimal solution faster than its counterparts, making it advantageous for time-sensitive applications. Incorporating innovative methods like chaos theory, the DNGO algorithm effectively avoids local optima, enabling a broader search for the best solution. The utilization of L\u00e9vy flight further enhances the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and navigate the search space more efficiently. Additionally, swarm intelligence is employed to simulate the collective behavior of decentralized systems, aiding in problem-solving. This research represents a significant advancement in optimization techniques for CCHP systems and offers a fresh perspective to the field of swarm-based optimization algorithms.", "affiliation": "Xi'an Traffic Engineering Institute, Xi'an, 710300, Shaanxi, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["energy analysis", "environmental impact assessment", "Economic assessment", "Exergy Analysis", "Combined Cooling Heating And Power (Cchp)", "Gas Engine System", "System Sizing", "Developed Northern Goshawk Optimization"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844024072396/pdf"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31208"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11154219"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11154219?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-06-07", "firstIndexDate": "2024-06-08", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-06-17", "dateOfRevision": "2024-06-08", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-05-14", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-05-14"}
