By design, the RCP emission and concentration </span><span class="s1001">pathways </span><span class="s100">were stripped of their association with a certain socio-economic development. Different levels of emissions and </span><span class="s1001">climate change </span><span class="s100">along the dimension of the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop of different socio-economic development pathways (SSPs) on the other dimension in a matrix. This integrative SSP-RCP framework is now widely used in the climate impact and policy analysis literature (see, e.g., http://iconics-ssp.org), where </span><span class="s1001">climate projections </span><span class="s100">obtained under the RCP </span><span class="s1001">scenarios </span><span class="s100">are analysed against the backdrop of various SSPs. As several emission updates were due, a new set of </span><span class="s1001">emission scenarios </span><span class="s100">was developed in conjunction with the SSPs. Hence, the abbreviation SSP is now used for two things: On the one hand SSP1, SSP2, &#8230;, SSP5 is used to denote the five socio-economic </span><span class="s1001">scenario </span><span class="s100">families. On the other hand, the abbreviations SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, &#8230;, SSP5-8.5 are used to denote the newly developed </span><span class="s1001">emission scenarios </span><span class="s100">that are the result of an SSP implementation within an </span><span class="s1001">integrated assessment model</span><span class="s100">.
