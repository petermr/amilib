Roads traversing protected areas, usually harm wildlife species (e.g., wildlife roadkill). Wildlife roadkill is of global conservation concern and has been reported to occur in different protected areas worldwide. Very little information on the problem is currently available in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). The purpose of this study was to identify factors that affect wildlife roadkill in the NCA. The 82-kilometer main road from Lodoare to Golini served as the study's transects. Data was collected for a duration of one year from July 2021 to June 2022. Vehicle moving with a speed limit of 20km/hr were used during the data collection. The survey started early in the morning from 07:00 am to 06:00 pm and employed both direct and opportunistic encounter observations for recording wildlife roadkill incidences. The results revealed that 85 individual animals belonging to 21 families, i.e., 5 mammalian, 3 reptilian, and 10 bird orders were recorded killed within one year period in the area. These animals comprised 26 different species, which included 10 mammalian, 5 reptilian, and 11 bird species. Moreover, more birds (69.4%) than mammals (18.8%) and reptiles (11.8%) were found killed in the area. Additionally, the night jars (Caprimulgus europaeus; 30.6%) followed by black rat (Rattus rattus; 7.1%) and chameleon (Chamaeleo chamaeleon; 3.5%) were the most frequently recorded killed species in the area. Furthermore, wildlife roadkills did not differ significantly between seasons (p\u2009=\u20090.371) and time of day (e.g., morning vs. afternoon; p\u2009=\u20090.652) but differed significantly between their body size (e.g., small, medium, and large; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and habitat types (e.g., grassland, woodland, shrubland, wooded grassland, forest; p\u2009=\u20090.005). The study recommends punishments and penalties for overspeeding drivers and installing cameras, speed limits, and signboards along the highway to alert drivers to reduce speed. Further, providing regular education to road users on the impacts of roadkill within the ecosystem is critical.", "affiliation": "Department of Ecological Monitoring, Ngorongoro Conservation Area

often contested global issues. Wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) on vital infrastructure, especially linear infrastructure, remains a persistent challenge from policy to practice and poses a serious life-threatening implication to humans and other non-human lives. Addressing this issue effectively requires solutions that provide win-win outcomes from both ecological and societal perspectives. This study critically analyzes a decade of roadkill incidents along Nepal's longest East-West national highway, which passes through a biologically diverse national park in the western Terai Arc Landscape Area (TAL). Findings are drawn from field-based primary data collection of the period 2012-2022, secondary literature review, key informant interviews, and spatial analysis. The study reveals significant variations in roadkill incidence across areas and years. Despite Bardia National Park being larger and having a higher wildlife density, Banke National Park recorded higher roadkill rates. This is attributed to insufficient mitigation measures and law enforcement, more straight highway segments, and the absence of buffer zones between the core park and adjacent forest areas-only a road separates them. Wild boars (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) and spotted deer (<i>Axis axis</i>), the primary prey of Bengal tigers (<i>Panthera tigris tigris</i>), were the most frequently road-killed species. This may contribute to human-tiger conflicts, as observed in the study areas. Seasonal trends showed that reptiles were at higher risk during the wet season and mammals during winter. Hotspots were often located near checkpoints and water bodies, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation efforts such as wildlife crossings and provisioning wildlife requirements such as water, grassland, and shelter away from the regular traffic roads. Roadkill frequency was also influenced by forest cover and time of day, with more incidents occurring at dawn and dusk when most of the herbivores become more active in search of food, shelter, water, and their herds. The findings underscore the importance of road characteristics, animal behavior, and landscape features in roadkill occurrences. Effective mitigation strategies include wildlife crossings, speed limits, warning signs, and public education campaigns. Further research is needed to understand the factors in driving variations between parks and to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures.", "affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science, GoldenGate International College, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Co-existence", "Roadkill", "Socio-ecology", "Tiger Prey-base", "Wildlife-vehicle Collision"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ani15101478"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12108416"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12108416?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-05-28", "firstIndexDate": "2025-05-28", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-05-30", "dateOfRevision": "2025-05-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-05-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-05-20"}, "PMC12124168": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "id": "40289901", "source": "MED", "pmid": "40289901", "pmcid": "PMC12124168", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC12124168"}, "doi": "10.1111/cobi.70049", "title": "Including the urbanization gradient in people-centered wildlife conservation in Amazonia.", "authorString": "Lemos LP, Valle D, Morcatty TQ, Chaves W.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Lemos LP", "firstName": "L\u00edsley P", "lastName": "Lemos", "initials": "LP", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2037-1549"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, Virginia, USA."}, {"affiliation": "Rede de Pesquisa para Estudos sobre Diversidade, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Uso da Fauna na Amaz\u00f4nia (RedeFauna), Manaus, Brazil."}, {"affiliation": "Mamirau\u00e1 Sustainable Development Institute, Tef\u00e9, Brazil."}, {"affiliation": "Center for Biology and Society, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA."}]}}, {"fullName": "Valle D", "firstName": "Denis", "lastName": "Valle", "initials": "D", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9830-8876"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Forest, Fisheries, and Geomatics Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Morcatty TQ", "firstName": "Tha\u00eds Queiroz", "lastName": "Morcatty", "initials": "TQ", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3095-7052"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Rede de Pesquisa para Estudos sobre Diversidade, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Uso da Fauna na Amaz\u00f4nia (RedeFauna), Manaus, Brazil."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Geography, University College London, London, UK."}]}}, {"fullName": "Chaves W", "firstName": "Willandia", "lastName": "Chaves", "initials": "W", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5487-3822"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, Virginia, USA."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3095-7052"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5487-3822"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9830-8876"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2037-1549"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"journalIssueId": "3921059", "dateOfPublication": "2025 Apr", "monthOfPublication": "4", "yearOfPublication": "2025", "printPublicationDate": "2025-04-01", "journal": {"title": "Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Conserv Biol", "medlineAbbreviation": "Conserv Biol", "NLMid": "9882301", "ISSN": "0888-8892", "ESSN": "1523-1739"}}, "pubYear": "2025", "pageInfo": "e70049", "abstractText": "Conservation policy in the Amazon traditionally focuses on rural areas, overlooking the socioecological roles of urban populations. This oversight can hinder sustainability by neglecting rural-urban connections. We compared the prevalence and quantity of wild meat consumed, bartered, and traded commercially in rural, peri-urban, and urban areas of the Brazilian Amazon to inform policies aimed at including local people in conservation. We also examined social factors influencing wildlife access. These factors included household management (single vs. dual adult households), household dependency (ratio of minors to working adults), residence status (single-sited vs. multisited households), frequency of rural area visits by urban residents, and market access by peri-urban and rural residents. We surveyed 782 households in Manaus and Carauari (Manaus: 299 urban, 90 peri-urban, 120 rural; Carauari: 159 urban, 41 peri-urban, 73 rural) about social factors related to wildlife used that are linked to urbanization. Results revealed widespread wildlife use across urbanization categories. The percentage of urban households that consumed (Manaus 22%, Carauari 57%), bartered (Manaus 17%, Carauari 30%), and traded (Manaus 21%, Carauari 7%) wildlife was substantial. Market access was higher in Manaus than in Carauari. Commercial trade in chelonians and barter of mammals and birds increased as access to markets increased. Commercial wildlife trade was present in urban households (Carauari 21% [95% CI 7-34], Manaus 16% [95% CI 6-26]) but higher in peri-urban Manaus (chelonian trade 44% [95% CI 22-62]). Given these high prevalence levels, especially near expanding urban areas, such as Manaus, wildlife barter and commercial trade likely contribute to unsustainable harvesting pressures, affecting people's sovereignty. Our research underscores the need for inclusive policies that regulate subsistence hunting to uphold rural rights; integration of fish and wildlife management in community-based conservation frameworks to enhance food security and reduce wildlife dependence; and inclusion of wildlife users in integrated development programs through community-based conservation to curtail wildlife trade,

wildlife spatiotemporal dynamics. This is especially important in landscapes faced with natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which include the state of Rhode Island, USA. Rhode Island is the second most densely populated state in the United States, yet the landscape remains highly forested. Similar to many areas in the region, land cover change and conversion to non-habitat cover types continue to be an issue as a result of increased anthropogenic disturbance, in addition to recent natural disturbance including forest structural changes from the spongy moth caterpillar (Lymantria dispar). These changes in land cover types and landscape patterns have the potential to positively or negatively affect wildlife communities, and thus, it is increasingly important to monitor wildlife populations. Camera traps provide an efficient way to inventory and monitor a large spatial area and record detections of a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates. We began surveying the state of Rhode Island as part of a focal study on bobcats (Lynx rufus, 2018-2020) and later fishers (Pekania pennanti, 2020-2023) while documenting all species of terrestrial vertebrates detected at camera survey locations. We placed cameras in areas with land cover appropriate for the original target species-primarily forests and forested wetlands-and avoided placing cameras directly along hiking trails or roads. The state was divided into two sections-west and east-to maximize study area coverage with limited equipment. Cameras were deployed for at least six weeks in each survey period and section. In total, we monitored 249 survey sites in the state over 12 survey periods (six winter seasons, five summer seasons, and one spring season). We collected 244,013 unique detections from 39 terrestrial vertebrate species (25 mammal species, 13 bird species, and non-personnel humans) throughout the study. These data provide spatial and temporal detection information that is useful for investigating the changes in wildlife populations over time and varying degrees of development through analyses including single species, multi-species, dynamic, and diel occupancy modeling. Results of these analyses can be used to understand how a changing landscape impacts wildlife species.

The objectives of this study were to assess the degree of KSNP natural resources utilization by the local community, the existing human-elephant conflict (HEC), trends of the conflict, methods used to minimize their negative impacts, and community attitudes and socio-demographic influencing factors regarding the conservation of African elephant in rather than and KSNP. The survey was carried out from November 2018 to September 2020. A total of 395 household heads were selected systematically from seven kebeles (the lowest governmental administrative units of Ethiopia). Direct field observations, household-based questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews (<i>i.e.</i>, administrators, professional experts, and park management staffs) were applied. The majority (74.51%) of the local communities utilized the park resources as grazing for livestock followed by fuel wood sources (46.04%), water sources (39.57%), and house construction materials (30.38%). More than 72% of the respondents suggested that crop raiding by elephants is a serious problem in the study area and increased in the past ten years. About 60.9% and 60.51% of the respondents mentioned that elephant-induced crop damage was during the wet season and at night, respectively. Crop damage was relatively high as cropland found inside and at the periphery of the park. Majorities of the respondents recommended that gun sounds/banging noisy materials (81.99%) and lighting fire/flashlight (44.95%) were the most common traditional protection methods from elephant crop damage. More than 56% of the respondents had positive attitudes toward the conservation of KSNP and elephant. About 54.18% of respondents were aware of park conservation and their awareness varied with age, education level, gender, settlement condition, and distance between settlement and park. The probability that males tended to respond to awareness was 3.5 times higher than that of female respondents. Males were more likely to have awareness about the aims of KSNP conservation and related issues. Factors influencing the attitude of the local community toward KSNP and elephant conservation in the area were age, education level, the distance between settlement and park, and their awareness status. Trends and levels of crop damage by elephants negatively influenced communities' attitudes toward elephant conservation. Significant variation (<i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of respondents was observed on HEC, trends of crop damage, mitigation measures, awareness, and their attitudes toward protected area (PA) and elephant conservation. Therefore, the smooth coexistence of KSNP and wildlife/elephants with the local communities could be maintained by establishing buffer zones in the area to ensure conservation sustainability and community livelihoods.", "affiliation": "Center for Environmental Sciences (Environmental Resources Conservation and Management), Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Tigray, Ethiopia.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Elephants"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Attitude"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Ethiopia"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Parks, Recreational"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Wildlife conservation", "Human-elephant Conflict", "Community Attitude", "Kafta Sheraro National Park"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.19428"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12103844"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12103844?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2025-05-26", "dateOfCreation": "2025-05-26", "firstIndexDate": "2025-05-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-05-27", "dateOfRevision": "2025-05-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-05-22", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-05-22"}, "PMC12091794": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "id": "40392893", "source": "MED", "pmid": "40392893", "pmcid": "PMC12091794", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC12091794"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0322878", "title": "Applying disease risk analysis for conservation translocations in Argentina: A case study on marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus).", "authorString": "Wiemeyer GM, Uhart MM, Rodr\u00edguez Planes L, Rago V, Guillemi EC, Chang Reissig E, Ra\u00f1o M, Di Nucci D, Beldomenico PM, Peker S, Geffner L, Orozco MM.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Wiemeyer GM", "firstName": "Guillermo M", "lastName": "Wiemeyer", "initials": "GM", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1634-3318"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Instituto de Ecolog\u00eda, Gen\u00e9tica y Evoluci\u00f3n de Buenos Aires (IEGEBA-CONICET), Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"affiliation": "Fundaci\u00f3n Cabur\u00e9-\u00ed, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"affiliation": "Grupo de Investigaciones en Biolog\u00eda de la Conservaci\u00f3n (INIBIOMA, CONICET-Universidad Nacional del Comahue), San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina."}]}}, {"fullName": "Uhart MM", "firstName": "Marcela M", "lastName": "Uhart", "initials": "MM", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3525-541X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Karen C.

Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis (DRA) is a recognized framework for addressing health hazards in translocations. However, DRA is not mandatory nor voluntarily applied in Argentina, despite increasing wildlife translocations. To test and adapt DRA to the local context, we performed a simplified DRA for the hypothetical translocation of marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) between two protected areas, Iber\u00e1 and El Impenetrable National Parks. A multidisciplinary team applied the main phases of DRA, problem description, hazard identification, risk assessment and mitigation, to this scenario. Out of 61 potential hazards identified, including pathogens and management issues, 14 priority hazards were highlighted using a paired risk prioritization tool. Of these, 66% have zoonotic potential. Presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis at the source (Iber\u00e1) but not the destination park signalled unacceptable risk under a One Health perspective. All other hazards, including pathogens, stress and seasonal factors, were considered manageable through strategic planning and mitigation actions. This study represents the first application of DRA to conservation translocations in Argentina, in a context of data and resource limitations. Strengthening baseline information and stakeholder engagement would enhance its utility. DRA findings should inform broader ecological evaluations to assess feasibility and relevance of translocations.

By 2011, wolves reached northern California and formed multiple packs within a decade of their arrival in the state. Gray wolf observations have been sporadic, however, in the comparatively open and nonforested ecosystems such as the nearby northern Great Basin. During a broad-scale, camera-trapping study, we detected a gray wolf on an unbaited camera trap in northwest Nevada. This observation represents the 2nd confirmed sighting of a gray wolf in the state of Nevada since the 1920s and the first documented camera trap detection for the species in the state. We discuss this observation in the context of historical gray wolf presence in Nevada and the potential for the species to establish in the northern Great Basin.", "affiliation": "Wildlife Biology Program W.A.
