Wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) on vital infrastructure, especially linear infrastructure, remains a persistent challenge from policy to practice and poses a serious life-threatening implication to humans and other non-human lives. Addressing this issue effectively requires solutions that provide win-win outcomes from both ecological and societal perspectives. This study critically analyzes a decade of roadkill incidents along Nepal's longest East-West national highway, which passes through a biologically diverse national park in the western Terai Arc Landscape Area (TAL). Findings are drawn from field-based primary data collection of the period 2012-2022, secondary literature review, key informant interviews, and spatial analysis. The study reveals significant variations in roadkill incidence across areas and years. Despite Bardia National Park being larger and having a higher wildlife density, Banke National Park recorded higher roadkill rates. This is attributed to insufficient mitigation measures and law enforcement, more straight highway segments, and the absence of buffer zones between the core park and adjacent forest areas-only a road separates them. Wild boars (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) and spotted deer (<i>Axis axis</i>), the primary prey of Bengal tigers (<i>Panthera tigris tigris</i>), were the most frequently road-killed species. This may contribute to human-tiger conflicts, as observed in the study areas. Seasonal trends showed that reptiles were at higher risk during the wet season and mammals during winter. Hotspots were often located near checkpoints and water bodies, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation efforts such as wildlife crossings and provisioning wildlife requirements such as water, grassland, and shelter away from the regular traffic roads. Roadkill frequency was also influenced by forest cover and time of day, with more incidents occurring at dawn and dusk when most of the herbivores become more active in search of food, shelter, water, and their herds. The findings underscore the importance of road characteristics, animal behavior, and landscape features in roadkill occurrences. Effective mitigation strategies include wildlife crossings, speed limits, warning signs, and public education campaigns. Further research is needed to understand the factors in driving variations between parks and to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures.", "affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science, GoldenGate International College, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Co-existence", "Roadkill", "Socio-ecology", "Tiger Prey-base", "Wildlife-vehicle Collision"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ani15101478"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12108416"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12108416?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-05-28", "firstIndexDate": "2025-05-28", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-05-30", "dateOfRevision": "2025-05-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-05-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-05-20"}
