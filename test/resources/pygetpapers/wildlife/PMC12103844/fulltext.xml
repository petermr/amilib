The objectives of this study were to assess the degree of KSNP natural resources utilization by the local community, the existing human-elephant conflict (HEC), trends of the conflict, methods used to minimize their negative impacts, and community attitudes and socio-demographic influencing factors regarding the conservation of African elephant in rather than and KSNP. The survey was carried out from November 2018 to September 2020. A total of 395 household heads were selected systematically from seven kebeles (the lowest governmental administrative units of Ethiopia). Direct field observations, household-based questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, administrators, professional experts, and park management staffs) were applied. The majority (74.51%) of the local communities utilized the park resources as grazing for livestock followed by fuel wood sources (46.04%), water sources (39.57%), and house construction materials (30.38%). More than 72% of the respondents suggested that crop raiding by elephants is a serious problem in the study area and increased in the past ten years. About 60.9% and 60.51% of the respondents mentioned that elephant-induced crop damage was during the wet season and at night, respectively. Crop damage was relatively high as cropland found inside and at the periphery of the park. Majorities of the respondents recommended that gun sounds/banging noisy materials (81.99%) and lighting fire/flashlight (44.95%) were the most common traditional protection methods from elephant crop damage. More than 56% of the respondents had positive attitudes toward the conservation of KSNP and elephant. About 54.18% of respondents were aware of park conservation and their awareness varied with age, education level, gender, settlement condition, and distance between settlement and park. The probability that males tended to respond to awareness was 3.5 times higher than that of female respondents. Males were more likely to have awareness about the aims of KSNP conservation and related issues. Factors influencing the attitude of the local community toward KSNP and elephant conservation in the area were age, education level, the distance between settlement and park, and their awareness status. Trends and levels of crop damage by elephants negatively influenced communities&#x02019; attitudes toward elephant conservation. Significant variation (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) of respondents was observed on HEC, trends of crop damage, mitigation measures, awareness, and their attitudes toward protected area (PA) and elephant conservation. Therefore, the smooth coexistence of KSNP and wildlife/elephants with the local communities could be maintained by establishing buffer zones in the area to ensure conservation sustainability and community livelihoods.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Human-elephant conflict</kwd><kwd>Community attitude</kwd><kwd>Wildlife conservation</kwd><kwd>Kafta Sheraro National Park</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>The Ethiopian Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Ethiopian Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education.

HWC can be defined as the negative interactions between humans and wildlife (<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen &#x00026; Linnell, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Draheim et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Messmer, 2009</xref>). It has recently become a fundamental aspect of wildlife management (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Fernando et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The conflict between conservation principles and other human interests is to be considered when analyzing and addressing human-wildlife interactions (<xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr">Redpath, Bhatia &#x00026; Young, 2014</xref>). HWC had been widely increasing across the world and is one of the main obstacles to wildlife conservation (<xref rid="ref-87" ref-type="bibr">Redpath et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) and it exists in different forms as humans continue to encroach on wildlife habitats (<xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Lamarque et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). In Africa, the negative interactions between humans and wildlife have been recognized a global conservation issue (<xref rid="ref-109" ref-type="bibr">Woodroffe, Thirgood &#x00026; Rabinowitz, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The primary causes of HWC include land use change, climate change and variability, and habitat degradation (<xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">Mukeka et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Lamarque et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-108" ref-type="bibr">Wittemyer et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Hoare, 1999</xref>), and the causes are pronounced in developing countries (<xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">Mukeka et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). In Africa, HWC increased due to climate change, habitat loss, and low PA management effectiveness (<xref rid="ref-103" ref-type="bibr">Tiller et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). HWC not only have adverse effects on communities&#x02019; livelihoods but also lead to negative attitudes toward wildlife conservation and wildlife resources (<xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Nelson, Bidwell &#x00026; Sillero-Zubiri, 2003</xref>). Managing competition between humans and wildlife for resources is a critical conservation issue (<xref rid="ref-109" ref-type="bibr">Woodroffe, Thirgood &#x00026; Rabinowitz, 2005</xref>). The attitudes held by local people towards wildlife are critical to managing the conflicts (<xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Naughton-Treves &#x00026; Treves, 2005</xref>). To ensure the wildlife management policies are effective to the local condition, it is important to understand the attitude of the local people which provides an overview on HWC (<xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Kideghesho, R&#x000f8;skaft &#x00026; Kaltenborn, 2007</xref>). Assessment of the local people attitude can provides insight to respond to economic losses by wildlife and wildlife protection regulation, the degree to which they are willing to coexist with wildlife, and attitude surveys may also predict how people&#x02019;s attitudes will influence conservation attitudes and vice versa (<xref rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr">Tarrant, Kruger &#x00026; du&#x000a0;Preez, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Browne-Nunez &#x00026; Jonker, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The conflict between people and elephants is a special case of HWC (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Draheim et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Agricultural crop raiding is one form of human-elephant conflict (HEC) (<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Long et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref-97" ref-type="bibr">Sitati, Walpole &#x00026; Leader-Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-98" ref-type="bibr">Sitati et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Crop raiding has negative impacts on perceptions of local communities toward elephants, which can strongly undermine conservation efforts (<xref rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr">Osborn &#x00026; Hill, 2005</xref>). The abundance of African elephants is more linked with human livelihood activities (<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Hoare, 1999</xref>), and the human impact on elephant causes a great challenge to PA and wildlife managers, and the local people themselves (<xref rid="ref-98" ref-type="bibr">Sitati et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-89" ref-type="bibr">Said et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). HEC is not a new phenomenon in African countries; however, due to encroachments of settlements onto elephant habitats, the conflict has continually increased (<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Hoare, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmeier-Karimi &#x00026; Schulte, 2015</xref>). The conflict between humans and elephants is a challenge in many African countries, leading to disturb the community livelihood (<xref rid="ref-105" ref-type="bibr">van Aarde &#x00026; Jackson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Hoare, 1999</xref>) and brings a negative attitude toward their conservation efforts (<xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Kamau, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr">Osborn &#x00026; Hill, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Human-elephant conflict (HEC) in Africa is more pronounced in village lands close to PAs within settlements and farmland-dominated areas (<xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Mmbaga, Munishi &#x00026; Treydte, 2017</xref>). Elephant crop raiding and encroachment of human activities into wildlife habitats as source of conflict were also increased over the past years in and around Kafta Sheraro National Park (KSNP) of the Tigray region (<xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Kalayu et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref-91" ref-type="bibr">Samson, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Atakilt, Gidey &#x00026; Gebregizabher, 2016</xref>). However, up-to-date KSNP lacks details information about HEC and attitudes of the local communities toward elephant conservation which hinders effective conservation measures for the park and its existing wildlife. Therefore, the objectives of the present study include: (1) To investigate trends of KSNP natural resource utilization by communities (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;as sources of HEC and a threat for elephant conservation), (2) assess the extent and trends of HEC, and methods used to minimize their negative impacts, (3) determine attitudes of the communities toward the conservation of the African elephant and KSNP, and (4) assess the effect of some demographic and socioeconomic factors on the attitude of local communities adjacent to KSNP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec><title>Description of the study area</title><p>Kafta Sheraro National Park (KSNP) was designated as a park in 2007 (Letter, No: 13/37/82/611) with an area of 2,176.43 km<sup>2</sup>. The park was formerly named the &#x0201c;Shire Wildlife Reserve&#x0201d; and was established in 1973 with an estimated area of 750 km<sup>2</sup>. KSNP is located in the Kafta Humera and Tahitay Adiyabo districts of the Tigray region 1356 km from Addis Ababa and 490 km from Mekelle city. The park is situated in between latitude 14&#x000b0;05&#x02032;&#x02013;14&#x000b0;27&#x02032;N and longitude 36&#x000b0;42&#x02032;&#x02013;37&#x000b0;39&#x02032;E. The park is bordered by Eritrea in the north and traversed by the Tekeze River (<xref rid="supp-3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). The elevation of the park varies from 539 to 1,130&#x000a0;m above sea level. The landforms are flat plain, undulating to rolling; some isolated hills and ridges, a chain of mountains and valleys. The climate is characterized by hot to warm semiarid and has seasonal rainfall (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Fitsum &#x00026; Bikila, 2020</xref>).

In the HEC survey, global positioning system (GPS) points were taken, which were hotspots for conflicts both in wet and dry seasons. Information on crop damage was also accessed to determine food preferences and the degree of crop loss. The field observations took place from January 2018 to September 2020 in both the wet and dry seasons.</p><p>A preliminary survey was conducted one week prior to actual data collection. This pretesting and piloting (before using it to collect data) observation helped to identify the park boundaries, decide the number of kebeles (Kebeles: the lowest governmental administrative units of Ethiopia) that they included, and understand the overall situation of KSNP. The survey was conducted with selected local household residents from two districts (Weredas); Kafta Humera and Tahitay Adiyabo. Seven kebeles were purposively selected and the selection of kebeles was based on the nearest to the park boundary, the experience of high resource utilization and encroachment by the community, and widespread observation of elephant crop raiding (crop damage). The Adiaser and Aditsetser kebeles are located within the eastern boundary of KSNP because these areas are more encroached by crop cultivation and animal grazing. The AdiGoshu, Mayweyni, and Wuhedet kebeles are located within the southern boundary of the KSNP, while Adebay and Freselam are adjacent (western part of the park) that possess elephant crop raiding is a negative important issue.</p><p>Households were systematically selected from each kebele. Thus, the first household selection started randomly from the settled households, and then the next households were selected systematically at every 9th interval in each kebele using the formula below until the given sample size was reached. Therefore, the size of the interval (k) for selection was calculated by k = N/n, where k = the size of the interval for selection; N = total population (households); and n = the number of samples required for the study (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Fitsum, Bikila &#x00026; Alemayehu, 2022</xref>). Finally, the sample of household heads was recorded as: AdiGoshu (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;72), Mayweyni (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;30), Wuhedet (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28), Adiaser (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37), Aditsetser (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70), Adebay (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;124), and Freselam (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;34), ranging from 6.5&#x02013;21 km from the boundary of the park. For analysis, the selected kebeles were divided into two distance categories, as those less than 9.0 km from the boundary of the park were assigned as &#x0201c;close&#x0201d;, whereas those that were above 9.0 km were termed as &#x0201c;far away&#x0201d; (distant). The distances were determined by recording GPS points of the park boundary and kebeles and by calculating the distance between them through Arc Map 10.3 software. Even though, all seven kebeles surveyed were outside the park boundary, most of their farming practices were inside and in the buffer zone of KSNP.</p></sec><sec><title>Household socioeconomic and attitudinal response</title><p>The interview data were collected from November 2018 to June 2019 through face-to-face semi-structured questionnaires. Before the main data collection, the drafted questionnaire was amended prior to use and improved in quality (clarity) based on a pre-survey sample of 90 randomly selected individuals from seven kebeles that were finally excluded from the main sampled respondents. The purpose of the interview was to assess the interaction of the local communities with African elephant and KSNP. Open-ended questions were preferable to discuss and elaborate some issues raised about elephant conservation problems. Interviews were limited or selected to one family head, either male or female, of an individual household. The respondents who lived or existed before 1991 were considered native, while respondents who came from other areas of the region after 1991 were consider resettled (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;relocated) because almost all those kebeles were well established after 1991.</p><p>Our questionnaire consisted of five basic questions/sections areas of interest. The 1st section covered the socio-demographic characteristics and economic activities of the respondents (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>,&#x000a0;age, gender, level of education, household size, land holding size, land occupation type, alternative income) and park communities inter action (settlement condition and distance from settlement to park border). The 2nd investigated residents&#x02019; natural resource utilization from the park. The 3rd part asked the respondents to rank the problematic wild animal species (elephant), and rate the damage response (a = high problem, b = moderate problem, c = low problem, and d = no complaint/no problem), which helped us to know the effect of elephant damage and compare it with other wild animals. Moreover, participants who selected that wildlife/elephant posed a problem (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;selected a, b, and c) had to identify a type of conflict in KSNP that the individual households experienced over the previous ten years. The 4th part interviewed about the situation of HEC: the elephant crop raiding trend as (a = increasing, b = same, c = decreasing, and d = unknown), the time of crops visited by elephant (a = Morning, b = night, c = afternoon, d = unknown), season (a = dry season, b = wet season, c=both seasons, d = no opinion), and the control mechanism or action taken (gun sound/banging noisy materials, lighting fire, alternative crop cultivation, and traditional fences) by the participants to prevent elephant crop damage. The 5th section explored their knowledge, attitude, and perception of the local community toward conservation of the KSNP and African elephants. To assess elephant and park conservation attitudes in the local communities, we employed 14 statements/questions about interviewees&#x02019; attitudes toward the conservation and benefits of the KSNP and the existing African elephant. The interviewees&#x02019; responses to each conservation attitude statement were categorized and recorded on a five basic point Likert scale (<xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Likert, 1932</xref>) as: (strongly agree = 1, agree = 2, neutral = 3, disagree = 4, and strongly disagree = 5).</p><p>The demographic and socioeconomic information as well as park communities&#x02019; interaction at the individual household level were utilized as independent variables while dependent variables (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;attitude toward elephant and park) in the logistic and generalized linear regression analyses employed in this paper.

The probable reason in our study was elephant crop raiding is related to phenology of crop plants (crops maturity and harvesting time) when they are most nutritious to them during the late wet season. As the wet season progresses and water is more readily available in all areas of the park, elephants are widely dispersed inside and outside the park. However, during the dry season, as water scarcity is very high, elephants are concentrated near the water points of KSNP (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;Tekeze River), and only irrigated crops are available on the river sides that are easy raids by elephant and natural fodder availability and quality decline with field crops.</p><p>Elephant crop raiding in this study took place during the night (60.51%).

The age categories from 22 to 39&#x000a0;years and 40 to 57&#x000a0;years were more likely to have a positive attitude toward KSNP and elephants than those in advanced age groups (over 57&#x000a0;years) because the third age (&#x0003e;57&#x000a0;years) category is a references category. The decrease in positive attitude with an increase in age of respondents might be because aged people had their own crop land inside the park, including livestock, and most of them did not attain formal education. Furthermore, aged residents around KSNP have low awareness toward significant of PAs and its conservation. The findings concur with <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Hariohay et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref><italic toggle="yes">,</italic> who reported that households with aged (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;more than 55&#x000a0;years) were mostly owners of livestock and that crop farms had a negative perception of wildlife conservation. However, a significant positive correlation between age and PA and wildlife/elephant conservation was observed (<xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">Ochieng, Elizabeth &#x00026; Nigel, 2021</xref>). Aged respondents had a little awareness toward elephant and its conservation (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ardiantiono et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). However, negative correlation between attitude and age of respondents was also reported against our results (<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Guerbois et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Khatun, Ahsan &#x00026; R&#x000f8;skaf, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Attitudes and perceptions of gender significantly influenced the conservation of PAs and their corresponding resources (<xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">Ochieng, Elizabeth &#x00026; Nigel, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). From the present study communities&#x02019; point of view, males were dominantly participating in agriculture and were more exposed to outdoor field work, while females kept at home work and cared for the whole family and children. As a result, male household heads had a more positive attitude toward PA and wildlife conservation than females, and this positively correlated with their level of knowledge/awareness about PA (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ardiantiono et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Mir et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Allendorf &#x00026; Allendorf, 2013</xref>). Education positively influenced the attitude of the communities toward the conservation of PAs and wildlife. These findings are in conformity with studies by other scholars (<xref rid="ref-84" ref-type="bibr">Rahman, Abdullah Al Mahmud &#x00026; Shahidullah, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr">Parker et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Carter et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Barthwal &#x00026; Mathur, 2012</xref>), who suggested that formal/more educated respondents were more likely to support the establishment and conservation of PAs and wildlife conservation. <xref rid="ref-92" ref-type="bibr">Sarker &#x00026; R&#x000f8;skaft (2014)</xref> reported that most respondents with illiterate/informal education did not support the conservation of PAs and elephants. Local residents with formal education are more likely to obey rules protecting PAs than illiterates (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Bragagnolo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Educated residents have the opportunity to employ, which provides alternative income that reduces the dependency of their livelihood on PAs natural resources (<xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Kideghesho, R&#x000f8;skaft &#x00026; Kaltenborn, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The distance of settlement to the PA boundary determines the level of interaction between humans and elephant/KSNP conservation. The results of our study indicated that the distance between residence and KSNP had a significant effect on the conservation attitude of respondents. Local communities that lived far away from the park showed a more positive attitude than those that lived close to KSNP because they experienced less interaction with wildlife and rarely visited elephant in their field crops. In this case, most respondents living in the administrative units of Adiaser and Aditsetser kebeles are relatively far away from the park boundary, showing a positive conservation attitude. On the other hand, the majority of residents who lived in Adebay, Freselam, and Wuhedet kebeles close to the park border showed a negative attitude. This directly reflects residents experiencing frequent crop damage by elephants, a lack of alternative income, and restricted access to the park resources made the community to bring negative attitude toward conservation. Similar results were reported from African PAs (<xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">Ochieng, Elizabeth &#x00026; Nigel, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Guerbois et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Abukari &#x00026; Mwalyosi, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref-92" ref-type="bibr">Sarker &#x00026; R&#x000f8;skaft, 2014</xref>), where respondents&#x02019; settlement far away from the PA positively influenced conservation attitudes, whereas settlements near to PAs negatively influenced the conservation attitude as the HWC is high. However, the far-distance residents of this study rarely reported conflicts with elephants, and their interaction was limited to specific areas and seasonal elephant&#x02019;s observations. This statement is consistent with <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Guerbois et&#x000a0;al. (2013)</xref>, who found that residents who had frequent contact with elephants had more negative attitudes than those who had rare contact. Likewise, communities close to PAs that have negative conservation attitudes were due to the damage induced by problematic animals (<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Kioko et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), and they did not gain any visible benefits from the conservation practices (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Bennett &#x00026; Dearden, 2014</xref>). The main drivers of negative attitudes toward conservation were household location (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;living close to the PA boundary), losses due to wild animals, and restricted access to natural resources (<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Guerbois et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). However, <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al. (2015)</xref> and reported that in contrast to our results, they found that residents&#x02019; proximity to the reserve border positively affects their attitude toward the conservation of the reserve because the local residents benefited from development projects that might result in more job opportunities and have less dependence on the resources of the reserve. <xref rid="ref-84" ref-type="bibr">Rahman, Abdullah Al Mahmud &#x00026; Shahidullah (2017)</xref> outlined, residents who lived away from PA were less aware of the importance of conservation than those who lived close to the park did not favor the conservation practices of the PA.</p><p>Respondents&#x02019; knowledge about establishments and aims of PAs conservation was a significant factor in determining their attitudes toward the KSNP conservation. Respondents who knew and appreciate the objectives of KNSP conservation were likely to have a more positive attitude than their counterparts who have little awareness. This is inlined with <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Abukari &#x00026; Mwalyosi (2018)</xref> and <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Allendorf (2007)</xref> who reported that the residents who know the objectives of PAs conservation to be considerate are more likely to hold positive attitudes toward PAs.</p><p>According to the resident&#x02019;s location to elephant conservation area and elephant crop raiding experience; they reported different conservation attitude scores. The current study indicated that respondents who damaged their crop fields by elephant use expressed a more negative attitude toward elephant conservation. Similarly, scholars confirmed that residents in areas where there was negative interaction between humans and elephants (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>,&#x000a0;elephant crop raiding) were likely to lead to less favorable (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;more negative) attitudes toward elephant and its conservation (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ardiantiono et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">Neupane, Johnson &#x00026; Risch, 2017</xref>). Elephant crop raiding has increased tension between Park and local communities, especially residents who have experienced crop loss by elephant grazing (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Andyono et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr">Oelrichs, Lloyd &#x00026; Christidis, 2016</xref>). Crop damage or livestock depredation incidents had a significant negative influence on the attitude of local communities toward wildlife conservation (<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Hariohay et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Mir et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). The negative attitudes of communities were brought as a result of economic damage by elephant crop raiding (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Bandara &#x00026; Tisdell, 2002</xref>). Residents who lived with wildlife had a negative attitude about wildlife, as HWC has been a serious threat (<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Long et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The existence of crop damage and little elephant revenue provided to locals resulted in a negative perception of the communities toward the conservation of elephants (<xref rid="ref-102" ref-type="bibr">Taruvinga &#x00026; Mushunje, 2014</xref>). Conversely, the positive interaction between elephant and human that received benefits from ecotourism and conservation activities might improve the local communities&#x02019; positive attitude (<xref rid="ref-92" ref-type="bibr">Sarker &#x00026; R&#x000f8;skaft, 2014</xref>). Local people who lived adjacent (0&#x02013;5 km) to PAs had a positive attitude toward the conservation of PA, to get some kind of benefit and to expect to share revenue from the reserve in the future, regardless of the existing cases of crop raiding (<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">Mojo et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Farming type (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.,</italic>&#x000a0;subsistence and commercial agriculture) is another important factor to determine the respondent&#x02019;s attitudes toward wildlife and PA conservation. Subsistence and commercial agricultural farmers held both positive and negative attitudes toward wildlife and they affect by HWC in different ways (<xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Seoraj-Pillai, 2016</xref>). In sub-Saharan Africa, studies show that negative attitudes toward wildlife exist among commercial (<xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr">Parker et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Lindsey et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) and subsistence (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Gusset et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) farmers, especially toward carnivores (<xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr">Parker et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Gusset et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In addition, a large group of elephants causes significant damage both to subsistence and commercial farms (<xref rid="ref-96" ref-type="bibr">Sitati &#x00026; Walpole, 2006</xref>). In this area, elephants negatively impact subsistence farmers by damaging the crops they rely upon for their livelihoods and food security (<xref rid="ref-107" ref-type="bibr">Wittemyer, 2001</xref>) and their economic stability disturb (<xref rid="ref-97" ref-type="bibr">Sitati, Walpole &#x00026; Leader-Williams, 2005</xref>). However, commercial farmers may be able to discourage depredation of crops using fencing and lethal control, such resources are unaffordable to subsistence farmers. <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Dickman (2010)</xref> showed subsistence farmers were antagonistic toward wildlife since the consequences of crop depredation following intensified by the lack of alternate income. According to <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Seoraj-Pillai (2016)</xref>, household income negatively influenced attitudes this arises because subsistence farmers were lower income earners than commercial farmers. In contrast, some subsistence farmers indicated a positive attitude to wildlife for example; traditional land use ethics and the values of the residents who co-existed with wildlife for many centuries could play a role in shaping a positive attitude toward subsistence farmers (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">DeGeorges &#x00026; Reilly, 2008</xref>). Commercial farmers had a positive attitude toward wildlife because crop damage by elephant decreased in areas with private investors (<xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Montero-Botey, Miguel &#x00026; Perea, 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion &#x00026; Recommendation</title><p>Human<bold>-</bold>elephant conflict (HEC) caused by crop damage has increased in and around KSNP over the past decade, presenting a conservation challenge. The observed increase in elephant crop attacks was associated with LULC changes mainly caused by the expansion of settlements and the conversion of woodlands to croplands. Crop damage peaked during the late wet season when crops were ready for harvesting. The crop damage increased as the area of residential farmland closed the PA boundary. The residents of the KSNP had both negative and positive attitudes toward the park and elephant conservation. A negative attitude was associated with restrictive access to the natural resources of the park, crop damage by elephants, and an absence of benefits from conservation activities. Education level, distance between residences and park, and degree of elephant crop damage were major factors that significantly affected residents&#x02019; attitudes toward the conservation of KSNP and elephants. Elephant conservation attitudes significantly varied with the distance between residences and park, where local communities living very close to PAs and with frequent elephant crop damage occurrences had more negative attitudes toward elephant conservation. On the other hand, residents who lived relatively far from the PA border had more positive conservation attitudes than those living near the PA border. Therefore, the conservation objective of PA/wildlife might be achieved by rational discussion with the local communities rather than by forced means. Consequently, it is imperative to understand the attitude of local people and increase their level of awareness/knowledge of PA and wildlife conservation in particular and nature conservation in general through continuous education. The smooth coexistence of KSNP and wildlife with the local communities could be maintained by establishing buffer zones in the area to ensure conservation sustainability and community livelihoods. Financial support should be allocated to the local communities to use green energy such as electricity, solar energy, and biogas to minimize household dependence on forest resources. Together with the conservation practices encourage ecotourism and nature reserve activities so that the local communities are exposed to alternative job opportunities and profit sharing. Facilitating the compensation process for crop damage caused by elephant use may improve attitudes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title> Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material id="supp-1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.19428/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>Raw data</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-13-19428-s001.csv"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp-2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.19428/supp-2</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 2</label><caption><title>Supplemental Tables</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-13-19428-s002.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp-3" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.19428/supp-3</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 3</label><caption><title>Supporting file 1 figures</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-13-19428-s003.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp-4" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.19428/supp-4</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 4</label><caption><title>Detailed socioeconomic study questionnaire form for households in English languages</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-13-19428-s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>I would like to thank the Ethiopian wildlife conservation authority for giving me a permission letter for field work.
