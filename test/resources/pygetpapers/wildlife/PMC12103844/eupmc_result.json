The objectives of this study were to assess the degree of KSNP natural resources utilization by the local community, the existing human-elephant conflict (HEC), trends of the conflict, methods used to minimize their negative impacts, and community attitudes and socio-demographic influencing factors regarding the conservation of African elephant in rather than and KSNP. The survey was carried out from November 2018 to September 2020. A total of 395 household heads were selected systematically from seven kebeles (the lowest governmental administrative units of Ethiopia). Direct field observations, household-based questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews (<i>i.e.</i>, administrators, professional experts, and park management staffs) were applied. The majority (74.51%) of the local communities utilized the park resources as grazing for livestock followed by fuel wood sources (46.04%), water sources (39.57%), and house construction materials (30.38%). More than 72% of the respondents suggested that crop raiding by elephants is a serious problem in the study area and increased in the past ten years. About 60.9% and 60.51% of the respondents mentioned that elephant-induced crop damage was during the wet season and at night, respectively. Crop damage was relatively high as cropland found inside and at the periphery of the park. Majorities of the respondents recommended that gun sounds/banging noisy materials (81.99%) and lighting fire/flashlight (44.95%) were the most common traditional protection methods from elephant crop damage. More than 56% of the respondents had positive attitudes toward the conservation of KSNP and elephant. About 54.18% of respondents were aware of park conservation and their awareness varied with age, education level, gender, settlement condition, and distance between settlement and park. The probability that males tended to respond to awareness was 3.5 times higher than that of female respondents. Males were more likely to have awareness about the aims of KSNP conservation and related issues. Factors influencing the attitude of the local community toward KSNP and elephant conservation in the area were age, education level, the distance between settlement and park, and their awareness status. Trends and levels of crop damage by elephants negatively influenced communities' attitudes toward elephant conservation. Significant variation (<i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of respondents was observed on HEC, trends of crop damage, mitigation measures, awareness, and their attitudes toward protected area (PA) and elephant conservation. Therefore, the smooth coexistence of KSNP and wildlife/elephants with the local communities could be maintained by establishing buffer zones in the area to ensure conservation sustainability and community livelihoods.", "affiliation": "Center for Environmental Sciences (Environmental Resources Conservation and Management), Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Tigray, Ethiopia.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Elephants"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Attitude"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Ethiopia"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Parks, Recreational"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Wildlife conservation", "Human-elephant Conflict", "Community Attitude", "Kafta Sheraro National Park"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.19428"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12103844"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12103844?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2025-05-26", "dateOfCreation": "2025-05-26", "firstIndexDate": "2025-05-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-05-27", "dateOfRevision": "2025-05-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-05-22", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-05-22"}
