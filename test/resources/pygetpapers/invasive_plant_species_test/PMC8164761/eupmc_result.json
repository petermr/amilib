The changes in standing wave ratio (SWR) caused by the presence of stem water and magnetic particles in the stem water flow were used as the basis of plant monitoring systems.<h4>Results</h4>The SWR of a coil probe was used to develop a non-invasive monitoring system to detect water content variation in live plants.

When a fixed frequency (1.611\u00a0GHz) was applied to a single experimental plant (Radermachera sinica), a more comprehensive monitoring, such as water content variation within the plant and the effect of illumination on water content, was achieved.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study demonstrated that the SWR of a coil probe could be used as a real-time, non-invasive, non-destructive parameter for detecting water content variation and practical vital activity in live plants.
