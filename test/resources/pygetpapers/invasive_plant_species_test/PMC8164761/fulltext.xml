Conventional plant irrigation and its scheduling are based on the analysis of soil water content and meteorological data. The oven-drying technique is generally used for measuring soil water content for research purposes due to its accuracy and simplicity. However, soil measurements performed at specific times are not directly related to the actual water flow in the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, measuring the actual water content of the plant xylem could provide more accurate information regarding the effect of water on plant growth and physiology.</p><p id="Par7">Numerous experimental methods are available to determine the actual water content of live plant components (i.e., leaves, stems, xylem, and roots), including dendrography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], pressure chamber methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], infrared image analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], impedance spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and radar systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, these methods involve complex experimental procedures that require costly instrumentation. Several methods have been developed to measure plant stem water content directly, including heat pulse systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], microneedle sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the standing wave ratio (SWR) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, these approaches require the insertion of a probe sensor system into the plant xylem, which might cause serious disturbance to the water flow conditions and, consequently, provide unreliable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that traces of paramagnetic metal components in plants (i.e., humus and water) could induce electrical inductance changes in a coil probe surrounding a plant and also demonstrated that there are clear electrical inductance differences between a live and a dead plant with or without the addition of water. These results suggested that differences in the inductance changes are closely related to differences between the metabolic and physiological activities of live and dead plants. Thus, the non-invasive measurement of stem water flow might be possible using an electromagnetic method.</p><p id="Par9">SWR is estimated by measuring the impedance matching of loads to the characteristic impedance of an antenna, transmission line, or waveguide, and measurements are obtained using a network analyzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SWR is widely used to estimate radio antenna performance (i.e., resonance point and transmission efficiency) at a specific radio frequency (RF). Due to water in live plant components and their electrical impedance, several studies have shown the transmission of specific RF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Besides, the variation in the water content of a plant has been estimated from SWR values using invasive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or non-invasive ring-type sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, these approaches focused only on the water flow in a plant. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid and simple method that will allow the effective estimation of water content variation in plants while observing their vital activity.</p><p id="Par10">In this study, we applied an SWR method for monitoring water content variations and vital activity in plants. Our approach, based on SWR measurements, may represent a simple, rapid, and unique monitoring method for detecting water content variation and vital activities in plants based on SWR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Changes in SWR for control and experimental vessels under different conditions</title><p id="Par11">An experiment was carried out to obtain preliminary SWR measurements for a vessel containing only soil (control vessel) using a coil probe located above the vessel. Using the same system, a vessel containing the plant <italic>Fatoua villosa</italic> (experimental vessel) was also examined.

For the control vessel, SWR showed multiple peaks with a minimum at 2.2 and a maximum at 16.3. No significant variation in the SWR was observed with the addition of water to the control vessel. However, when water was added to the experimental vessel, differences in the SWR, compared with that of the control vessel, were observed throughout the frequency range. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the experimental vessel induced two peak frequencies, and its SWR values were lower than those of the control vessel throughout the frequency range. For instance, the control vessel showed a peak at 1.629&#x000a0;GHz with an SWR of 16.1, whereas the experimental vessel showed a left-shifted peak at 1.620&#x000a0;GHz with an SWR of 14.8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).

These results indicated that interaction between water and the live plant induced SWR changes at specific frequencies that the coil probe could monitor. These SWR changes were probably caused by plant physiological activities, including transpiration and water transportation, which affected the RF characteristics of the coil probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">To evaluate the effect of illumination on <italic>F. villosa</italic>, SWR measurements were obtained after 3&#x000a0;d of no watering and 3&#x000a0;h post-watering without illumination. No differences were observed in the SWR post-watering with or without illumination. However, when <italic>Radermachera sinica</italic> was used as an experimental plant, watering with or without illumination yielded a markedly different SWR at 1.0&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;GHz. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, watering under illumination decreased the SWR by 11.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.79% at 1.170&#x000a0;GHz (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), increased it by 10.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.85% at 1.611&#x000a0;GHz (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), and decreased it by 9.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.93% at 1.908&#x000a0;GHz (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). The dead plants showed significantly different SWR compared with those of the live plants but almost identical with those of the control vessel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, the plant configuration (i.e., leaf number, leaf shape, and stem length) and physiological activities (i.e., photosynthesis, stem water flow, water content, and concentration of magnetic materials) might affect SWR throughout the frequency range.

Our results indicated that electrical (i.e., winding number and diameter of the probe), biological (i.e., plant age, growth, type, and size), and environmental (i.e., water, illumination, and fertilization) factors could affect the SWR. Therefore, our monitoring system could be used for other plant species and different conditions using modified probes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par20">The aim of the present study was to establish a simple, almost real-time, non-invasive system for monitoring the water content and vital activities in plants. Using a simple coil probe, we demonstrated that SWR variations might allow detecting changes in the water content or vital activities of plants at a fixed frequency. However, more research is needed to improve the coil type probe dimensions and verify the effectiveness and overall applicability of our monitoring system in various plant species, plant physiological conditions, sample sizes, and experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Plant preparation</title><p id="Par21">In this study, we examined the effect of water addition and illumination on five different experimental plants: <italic>F. villosa</italic> (height: approximately 550&#x000a0;mm)<italic>, R. sinica</italic> (height: approximately 700&#x000a0;mm), <italic>F. benghalensis</italic> (height: approximately 500&#x000a0;mm), <italic>D. lutescens</italic> (height: approximately 550&#x000a0;mm), and <italic>S.

The selection criteria of the experimental plants were their easy indoor growing characteristics and shape differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. All experimental plants were purchased from the Yangjae Flower Market, Seoul, Republic of Korea. The plants were cultivated for a month before the experiment in a vessel (200&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;180&#x000a0;mm diameter) containing 500&#x000a0;g of organic soil (Jeil Co., Seoul, Korea) under illumination with an intensity of 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s at 22&#x02013;25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

To minimize the effect of external electromagnetic fields, the plant and system were placed inside a grounded Faraday cage (710&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;350&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1380&#x000a0;mm) covered with a copper mesh (70-gauge, 0.15&#x000a0;mm), and the plant was watered with tap water (200&#x000a0;ml) using a peristaltic pump. Metabolic activity was maintained under illumination (PAR38, Philips, Holland) with an intensity of 110&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s at 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The coil probe was constructed using a 0.3&#x000a0;mm copper wire wound 100 times around an acrylic bobbin (250&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;mm), and the ends of the wire were tabbed for connection to the SWR meter. The inductance and impedance of the empty coil probe (i.e. without the load of the plant and/or vessel) were 3.481&#x000a0;mH and 35.235&#x000a0;M&#x003a9; (at 1.611&#x000a0;GHz), respectively. The inductance and impedance were measured by an inductance meter (LC200A, Brightwin Electronics, China). The experimental plant was then surrounded with the coil probe at a height of 200&#x000a0;mm from the cultivate vessel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The tabbed ends of the coil probe were connected to a computer-controlled network analyzer (MS46121B, Anritsu, Japan) using an N-type connector and a coaxial cable (15NNF50-1.5C, Anritsu, Japan). When the system was initially set-up with the plant, frequencies of 1.0&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;GHz were scanned, and the SWR variation from the probe was monitored. The SWR results from the probe were recorded using control software (Shockline, Anritsu, Japan). For the control experiment, the SWR was measured with an empty vessel that contained only organic soil (500&#x000a0;g) under the same experimental conditions. For the live plant measurement, the experimental plant was placed in a vessel with organic soil and watered. After 3&#x000a0;h of stabilization, the first SWR measurement was obtained. The measurement for the &#x0201c;before water addition condition&#x0201d; was obtained at 7&#x000a0;d for <italic>F. benghalensis</italic>, 5&#x000a0;d for <italic>Dypsis lutescens</italic>, and 3&#x000a0;days for <italic>R. sinica</italic>, <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic>, and <italic>F. villosa</italic>. In the illumination condition experiment, illumination was turned off for at least 12&#x000a0;h before the water was added. All SWR experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the average values were plotted.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the monitoring system: (1) Faraday cage, (2) coil probe, (3) supporter, (4) coaxial cable and N-type connectors, (5) network analyzer, (6) PC and control software, (7) tap water, (8) peristaltic pump, (9) experimental plant (<italic>Ficus benghalensis</italic>), and (10) LED light</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2021_757_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Plant death and moisture measurement methods</title><p id="Par23">After the experiment, the live plant was killed using a heat gun (KX-1800, Black and Decker, USA) for 5&#x000a0;min.
