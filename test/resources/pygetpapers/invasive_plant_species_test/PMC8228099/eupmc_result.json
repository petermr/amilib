It should be noted that IAA-L-alanine was detected entirely in the invasive plants under both growth temperatures. Further, the ethylene emission values increased significantly in invasive lupine hypocotyls under 30 \u00b0C. Invasive plants showed plasticity in their response by reducing growth in a timely manner and adapting to the rise in temperature.
