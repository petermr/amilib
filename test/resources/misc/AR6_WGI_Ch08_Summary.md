# Summary of Changes in the Global Water Cycle
## Introduction: 
This chapter evaluates past, present, and future changes in the global water cycle, complementing other chapters on climate change impacts. It covers the physical basis, observed changes, causes, future projections, uncertainties, and potential for abrupt changes.
## Physical Basis for Water Cycle Changes: 
Anthropogenic radiative forcings significantly modify Earth's energy budget, leading to widespread changes in the global water cycle. There is high confidence that global mean precipitation and evaporation increase with global warming, albeit model-dependent.
## Observed Changes and Causes: 
Human-caused climate change, particularly greenhouse gas forcing, has driven detectable alterations in the global water cycle since the mid-20th century. This includes increased atmospheric moisture, precipitation intensity, and changes in terrestrial evapotranspiration and aridity patterns.
## Future Projections: 
Without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, global warming is projected to intensify changes in the water cycle. This includes increased precipitation intensity, shifts in storm tracks, and more pronounced water cycle variability and extremes across most regions.
## Confidence in Projections and Non-linear Responses: 
While models have improved, uncertainties remain regarding natural variability and the potential for non-linear responses in the water cycle. Continued global warming is expected to amplify changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, with the potential for abrupt changes, particularly in sensitive ecosystems like the Amazon.
## Conclusion: 
The assessment underscores the complex interplay of drivers influencing the water cycle, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to mitigate and adapt to future changes.

This summary captures the key findings regarding how human activities, especially greenhouse gas emissions, alter the global water cycle, the observed impacts to date, projected future changes, and the associated uncertainties and potential for abrupt changes.
