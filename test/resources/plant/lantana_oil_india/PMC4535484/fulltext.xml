In view of the recent increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical insecticides, the objective of this study was to determine the repellent activity of creams formulated with methanol crude extract (MCE), hexane fraction (HF), and ethyl acetate fractions (EAFs) of <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> and <italic>Lantana camara</italic> leaves in single and combined actions against female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Evaluation was carried out in the net cages (30 by 30 by 30&#x02009;cm) containing 60 blood-starved female mosquitoes each and were assayed in the laboratory condition following World Health Organization 2009 protocol. All formulations (single and mixture) were applied at 2, 4, 6, and 8&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> in the exposed area of human hands. Only acetone&#x02009;+&#x02009;white soft paraffin served as negative control and odomos (12% DEET) as positive control. All the formulations presented good protection against mosquito bites without any allergic reaction by the human volunteers. The repellent activity was dependent on the strength of the extracts and fractions. Among the tested formulations, the maximum protection time was observed in MCE (120&#x02009;min) and EAF (150&#x02009;min) of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>; MCE:MCE (150&#x02009;min) and HF:HF (120&#x02009;min) mixtures of both plants. In addition, MCE:MCE and HF:HF mixtures from both plants showed possible synergistic effect. From the results, the combination of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>L. camara</italic> to formulate natural mosquito repellent using small amount of extracts can be encouraging to be an alternative to conventional DEET.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Lantana camara</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic></kwd><kwd>mosquito repellent formulation</kwd><kwd>synergism</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Mosquitoes are the most deadly vectors of parasites that cause diseases such as malaria, filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and yellow fever (<xref rid="iev025-B24" ref-type="bibr">Renugadevi et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> alone is a very important disease vector, transmitting the arbovirus that causes dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, chikungunya, and allergic skin reaction especially in children, which is endemic to Southeast Asia, the Pacific island area, the Americas, and Africa (<xref rid="iev025-B26" ref-type="bibr">Supratik et&#x000a0;al<italic>.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>Dengue fever is clinically difficult to diagnose especially in the developing countries with no established diagnostic facility and could easily be mistaken another disease (<xref rid="iev025-B4" ref-type="bibr">Baba et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>).

An estimated 252 patients with yellow fever were hospitalized. The case fatality ratio for hospitalized patients was approximately 40%. The diagnosis of yellow fever was confirmed by virus isolation, serology, or pathology in 55 patients. It was estimated that up to 100,000 cases of yellow fever may have occurred during the epidemic (<xref rid="iev025-B8" ref-type="bibr">Carey et&#x000a0;al. 1972</xref>).</p><p>One commonly advocated approach for preventing mosquito bites is personal protection. This method allows an individual to select from (or combine) avoidance techniques, exclusion of mosquitoes with physical and chemical barriers, treatment of fabric with toxicants, and the use of topical (skin) repellents (<xref rid="iev025-B5" ref-type="bibr">Barnard and Xue 2004</xref>). Application of repellents to the skin is a common personal protection practice (<xref rid="iev025-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kazembe and Nkomo 2012</xref>). Numerous mosquito repellents under a variety of brand names are currently commercially available to consumers throughout the world. Most of them contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), which has broad-spectrum activity and effectively repels most mosquitoes, biting flies, chiggers, fleas, and ticks. It is the most effective insect repellent available for human use (<xref rid="iev025-B15" ref-type="bibr">Fradin and Day 2002</xref>). Currently, DEET is formulated in aerosols, pump sprays, lotions, creams, liquids, sticks, roll-ons, and impregnated towelettes, with concentrations ranging from 5 to 100%. However, DEET has shown adverse effects when applied as directed. The most common problem is local skin irritation, including erythema and pruritis, at the site of application. One case of anaphylaxis after brief exposure to DEET has been reported (<xref rid="iev025-B22" ref-type="bibr">Osimitz and Murphy 1997</xref>). Many people who applied high concentrations of DEET on a daily basis have developed more severe adverse effects due to chronic exposure. These adverse effects included insomnia, muscle cramps, mood disturbances, and rashes (<xref rid="iev025-B22" ref-type="bibr">Osimitz and Murphy 1997</xref>). For this reason, extracts of several plants have been studied as possible mosquito repellents revealing the existence of natural repellents with good efficacy (<xref rid="iev025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> L.

The MCE of <italic>L. camara</italic> and <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> (0.5&#x02009;g of extract in 1.5&#x02009;ml of acetone each) were poured together into melted white soft paraffin making it at the same concentration as in single formulation (1&#x02009;g of extract in 3&#x02009;ml of acetone). The same procedure was performed for HF and EAF. The mixture was swirled properly to ensure that the extract or fraction was uniformly mixed with the white soft paraffin using a spatula before transferring in a screwed covered bottle. The combination was used to investigate the possibility of synergistic activity. The thick product (25 % w/w cream) was then taken for repellency test. The negative control was set up in poring 3&#x02009;ml of acetone in 4&#x02009;g of melted white soft paraffin without any trace of extract or fraction.

Before each test, the hand of a human subject was washed with unscented neutral soap, thoroughly rinsed, and allowed to dry 20&#x02009;min before formulation application. The formulation was applied from the wrist to the fingertips. An attempt of the mosquito to insert its stylets was considered as a bite, recorded and then shaken off before imbibing any blood. A treated hand with acetone and white soft paraffin formulation served as a negative control. The left hand was used for treatment and the right one for negative control. The control hand was exposed to mosquitoes before the treated hand for 3&#x02009;min and the number of mosquito bites recorded. To determine the dose&#x02013;response experiments, a series of repellency experiments was performed starting with the application of 0.1&#x02009;g of formulated cream on 49&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> cut off area (&#x02248;2&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) dose of the formulation.

This was to check the minimum concentration of formulation, which gave complete protection from mosquito bites. To equalize chances to all formulations, 8&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> was applied.

These diseases are transmitted to human beings through mosquito bite only. Prevention of mosquito bites is one of the main strategies to control or minimize incidence of these diseases. The use of insect repellents can provide practical and economical means of preventing mosquito-borne diseases and dead. It is important not only for local people in disease risk areas as Nigeria but also for travelers who are vulnerable to diseases spread by mosquito vectors when they visit and seek leisure away from their home countries. Many mosquito formulations have been made containing essential oil of plant materials (<xref rid="iev025-B13" ref-type="bibr">Egunyomi et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="iev025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="iev025-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adeniran and Fabiyi 2012</xref>, <xref rid="iev025-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dickens and Bohbot 2013</xref>). The inconvenient of such product is that essential oil has short time of effectiveness because of its rapid volatility. Vanillin is usually added to increase the protection time of the oils (<xref rid="iev025-B3" ref-type="bibr">Apiwat et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>). In this work, creams formulated as mosquito repellents from MCE, HF, and EAFs of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>L. camara</italic> against <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> bites were made.</p><p>In previous findings, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> leaf showed good mosquito larvicidal activity against <italic>C</italic><italic>ule</italic><italic>x</italic><italic> gelidus</italic> and <italic>C</italic><italic>ule</italic><italic>x</italic><italic> quinquefasciatus</italic>. When adults of the same mosquito species were exposed to the concentration of 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml ethyl acetate and methanol extracts for 1&#x02009;h, above 90% mortality was recorded after 24&#x02009;h of recovery period (<xref rid="iev025-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chinnaperumal and Rahuman 2010</xref>). In Nigeria, formulated ointments from <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> leaf essential oil were tested against <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> on rat. The formulation results of 1&#x02009;g of petroleum jelly in 1&#x02009;ml and 1.5&#x02009;ml of essential oil showed 100% protection and that in 0.5&#x02009;ml essential oil, 93%. The toxicity study on the shaved rat skin showed no obvious effect for 3&#x02009;wk (<xref rid="iev025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). In this study, 1&#x02009;g of extract or fraction in 4&#x02009;g of white soft paraffin provided total protection up to 120&#x02009;min for MCE and 60&#x02009;min for HF. No adverse effects were observed on the human volunteers throughout 3&#x02009;wk after the application of the formulations. Confidence in the safety repellent efficiency of this study was thus established.</p><p>In India, the petroleum ether extract of <italic>L. camara</italic> showed larvicidal activity against <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> recording 100% mortality after 48&#x02009;h of incubation with LC<sub>50</sub> of 251&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml (<xref rid="iev025-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anitha and Geethapriya 2012</xref>). Still in India, the repellent effect of <italic>L. camara</italic> flowers was evaluated against <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. The flower extract in coconut oil provided 94.5% protection from <italic>Ae</italic><italic>des</italic><italic> albopictus</italic> and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> bites. The mean protection time was 1.9&#x02009;h.

In Nigeria, hexane and methanol extracts of <italic>L. camara</italic> leaf recorded complete protection after 30&#x02009;min of 2&#x02009;mg/ml application on guinea pigs (<xref rid="iev025-B13" ref-type="bibr">Egunyomi et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). In this study, MCE and HF of <italic>L. camara</italic> showed total protection of 60&#x02009;min. No adverse effects were also observed on the skin of human volunteers 3&#x02009;wk after the application of the formulations. This confirmed the promising safety and repellent activity of <italic>L. camara</italic> claimed by some people in the rural areas of Nigeria when they planted it near the entrance of their house.</p><p>In this study, MCE and HF showed possible synergistic effect while EAF exhibited possible antagonistic action within <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>&#x02013;<italic>L. camara</italic> mixture. The same results were also observed by <xref rid="iev025-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kazembe and Nkomo (2012),</xref> when they combined essential oils from <italic>Blumea alata</italic>, <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic><italic>,</italic> and <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> fresh leaves for mosquito repellents. A clear case of synergism was established in the mixture of <italic>B. alata</italic> with <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic>.</p><p>Though the mechanism of action of the formulated repellents in this study was not yet established, several lines of evidence suggest that insect repellent molecules reduce mosquito-host contacts by interacting with odorants and odorant receptors, thereby ultimately affecting olfactory-driven behaviors (<xref rid="iev025-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bohbot et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). The first detailed mode of action of repellents was summarized by <xref rid="iev025-B10" ref-type="bibr">Davis (1985)</xref>. Techniques were available for single cell recordings from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) on the antennae of mosquitoes, and a number of repellent compounds were tested for their activity on these cells. Based mostly on these electrophysiological studies, Davis hypothesized that repellents had their effect by modifying or blocking responses of ORNs normally sensitive to attractants. The same point was made by <xref rid="iev025-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dickens and Bohbot (2013)</xref>. In this study, one or more compounds should be responsible of modifying or blocking responses of ORNs normally sensitive to attractants.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of repellents by travelers (civilian and military) may reduce the occurrence of mosquito borne diseases in temperate areas. In country like Nigeria, where foreign trading business and tourism are major sources of national income, people may use creams formulated with <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>L. camara</italic> MCE, HF, and EAFs, lonely or in combination as mosquito repellents at the place of DEET to increase their pleasure and comfort. In military operations, they may reduce the diseases and annoyance to personnel, who can then complete their operations more efficiently. They can therefore be viewed as a tool with a specific role in protecting people from mosquito-borne diseases. However, a lot of works need to be done: removing the greenness of the extracts and fractions, extend the work to other mosquito species though it is basically known that <italic>Aedes</italic> genus is the most resistant mosquito to repel, do further fractionation to get the molecule(s) mostly responsible of repellence, and field trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Aknowledgments</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the guidance of Dr. SI Okeke (PhD), a botanist at Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State, Nigeria, during the harvesting of the leaves.
