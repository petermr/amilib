In view of the recent increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides as an alternative to chemical insecticides, the objective of this study was to determine the repellent activity of creams formulated with methanol crude extract (MCE), hexane fraction (HF), and ethyl acetate fractions (EAFs) of <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> and <italic>Lantana camara</italic> leaves in single and combined actions against female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Evaluation was carried out in the net cages (30 by 30 by 30&#8201;cm) containing 60 blood-starved female mosquitoes each and were assayed in the laboratory condition following World Health Organization 2009 protocol. All formulations (single and mixture) were applied at 2, 4, 6, and 8&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> in the exposed area of human hands. Only acetone&#8201;+&#8201;white soft paraffin served as negative control and odomos (12% DEET) as positive control. All the formulations presented good protection against mosquito bites without any allergic reaction by the human volunteers. The repellent activity was dependent on the strength of the extracts and fractions. Among the tested formulations, the maximum protection time was observed in MCE (120&#8201;min) and EAF (150&#8201;min) of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>; MCE:MCE (150&#8201;min) and HF:HF (120&#8201;min) mixtures of both plants. In addition, MCE:MCE and HF:HF mixtures from both plants showed possible synergistic effect. From the results, the combination of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>L. camara</italic> to formulate natural mosquito repellent using small amount of extracts can be encouraging to be an alternative to conventional DEET.</p></abstract>
