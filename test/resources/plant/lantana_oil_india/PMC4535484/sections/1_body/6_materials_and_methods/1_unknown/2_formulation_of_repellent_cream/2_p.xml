It is used in a variety of applications, which include pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and skin care uses. It is an odorless jelly that is impervious to water (<xref rid="iev025-B7" ref-type="bibr">Callahan 2014</xref>). The stratum corneum is an outer layer of the skin cells that retains moisture in the skin. This layer can be diminished or lost for a variety of reasons. These include aging and washing with soap and hot water (<xref rid="iev025-B7" ref-type="bibr">Callahan 2014</xref>). Applying white soft paraffin creates a substitute for the stratum corneum and the sebum that naturally keeps the skin moisturized. This improves the health of the skin, diminishes dryness, and prevents cracking (<xref rid="iev025-B7" ref-type="bibr">Callahan 2014</xref>).</p>
