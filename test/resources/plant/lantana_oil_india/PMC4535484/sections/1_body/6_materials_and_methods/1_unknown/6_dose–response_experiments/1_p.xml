Before each test, the hand of a human subject was washed with unscented neutral soap, thoroughly rinsed, and allowed to dry 20&#8201;min before formulation application. The formulation was applied from the wrist to the fingertips. An attempt of the mosquito to insert its stylets was considered as a bite, recorded and then shaken off before imbibing any blood. A treated hand with acetone and white soft paraffin formulation served as a negative control. The left hand was used for treatment and the right one for negative control. The control hand was exposed to mosquitoes before the treated hand for 3&#8201;min and the number of mosquito bites recorded. To determine the dose&#8211;response experiments, a series of repellency experiments was performed starting with the application of 0.1&#8201;g of formulated cream on 49&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup> cut off area (&#8776;2&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) dose of the formulation. The 2&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> dose was applied on the open area of the hand and the percent repellency during the 3&#8201;min exposure time was determined. The dose was increased by 2&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> for each succeeding experiment, calculating the percent repellence after each dose, until 0.4&#8201;g of formulated cream on 49&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup> cut off area (&#8776;8&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). This was to check the minimum concentration of formulation, which gave complete protection from mosquito bites. To equalize chances to all formulations, 8&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> was applied. The repellence percentage was then plotted against concentrations of formulations to check the minimal dose to be applied for total protection.</p>
