The plants were identified by Dr. S. I. Okeke (PhD), a botanist at Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State, Nigeria. The plant materials were air dried at room (temperature of 28&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3&#176;C, 79&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4% relative humidity [RH]) for 2&#8201;wk. The dried leaves were ground in powder using an electric grinder until the powder passed through a 0.4-mm mesh sieve. The extraction and fractionation procedures were carried out in accordance with the method adopted by <xref rid="iev025-B19" ref-type="bibr">Okoye and Osadede (2009)</xref>. From the collection of plant material powder, 500&#8201;g for <italic>L. camara</italic> and 325&#8201;g for <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> were extracted for 3&#8201;d by cold maceration in methanol JQ American Corporation JQLAB, California (USA) shaking it thrice per day (morning, noon, and afternoon) in the laboratory of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry. The maceration process was then repeated twice for maximal extraction. The suspension was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper (size: 24&#8201;cm, England) Cole-Parmer Instrument Co. Ltd. (United Kingdom). The MCE (11.68% for <italic>L. camara</italic> and 6.23% for <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>) were concentrated to dryness in rotary vacuum evaporator RE300 (ROTAFLO, England) Fisher Scientific UK Ltd. (United Kingdom). The MCEs were adsorbed on silica gel (60&#8211;200 mesh) GeeJay Chemicals Ltd. (United Kingdom) and eluted in succession with hexane and ethyl acetate JQ American Corporation JQLAB, California (USA) to obtain HF (30.05% for <italic>L. camara</italic> and 26.11% for <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>) and EAF (24.59% for <italic>L. camara</italic> and 27.55% for <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>). All the extracts and fractions were stored in a refrigerator at &#8722;4&#176;C American refrigeration Company, Inc., 149 River Street (USA) until used.</p>
