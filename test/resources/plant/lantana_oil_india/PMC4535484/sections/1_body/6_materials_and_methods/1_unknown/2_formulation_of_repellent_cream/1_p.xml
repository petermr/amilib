One gram of MCE, HF, and EAF of each plant material was weighted out in 5-ml tubes using Adventurer Scale, Ohaus Corp. Pine Brook, NJ; max cap: 210&#8201;g; readability: 0.0001&#8201;g Ohaus Corporation, New Jersy (USA); and diluted in 3&#8201;ml of acetone Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC (USA) over night for proper dilution. For combination, 0.5&#8201;g of each MCE, HF, and EAF from each plant material were also weighted out in 5&#8201;ml tubes and diluted in 1.5&#8201;ml of acetone. The following day, 4&#8201;g of white soft paraffin Kerax Limited, (United Kingdom) (either for single extract or combined extract) was accurately weighted into a 100&#8201;ml beaker and melted in water bath at 60&#176;C. At this stage, the aliquot was transferred into the molten white soft paraffin. The MCE of <italic>L. camara</italic> and <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> (0.5&#8201;g of extract in 1.5&#8201;ml of acetone each) were poured together into melted white soft paraffin making it at the same concentration as in single formulation (1&#8201;g of extract in 3&#8201;ml of acetone). The same procedure was performed for HF and EAF. The mixture was swirled properly to ensure that the extract or fraction was uniformly mixed with the white soft paraffin using a spatula before transferring in a screwed covered bottle. The combination was used to investigate the possibility of synergistic activity. The thick product (25 % w/w cream) was then taken for repellency test. The negative control was set up in poring 3&#8201;ml of acetone in 4&#8201;g of melted white soft paraffin without any trace of extract or fraction. Odomos (12% DEET), bought in a pharmacy at Awka, Anambra State, Nigeria, which is a conventional mosquito repellent was used as positive control to compare the test results with.</p>
