Still in India, the repellent effect of <italic>L. camara</italic> flowers was evaluated against <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. The flower extract in coconut oil provided 94.5% protection from <italic>Ae</italic><italic>des</italic><italic> albopictus</italic> and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> bites. The mean protection time was 1.9&#8201;h. No adverse effects were observed on the human volunteers 3&#8201;mo after the application of the formulations (<xref rid="iev025-B12" ref-type="bibr">Dua et&#160;al. 1996</xref>). In Nigeria, hexane and methanol extracts of <italic>L. camara</italic> leaf recorded complete protection after 30&#8201;min of 2&#8201;mg/ml application on guinea pigs (<xref rid="iev025-B13" ref-type="bibr">Egunyomi et&#160;al. 2010</xref>). In this study, MCE and HF of <italic>L. camara</italic> showed total protection of 60&#8201;min. No adverse effects were also observed on the skin of human volunteers 3&#8201;wk after the application of the formulations. This confirmed the promising safety and repellent activity of <italic>L. camara</italic> claimed by some people in the rural areas of Nigeria when they planted it near the entrance of their house.</p>
