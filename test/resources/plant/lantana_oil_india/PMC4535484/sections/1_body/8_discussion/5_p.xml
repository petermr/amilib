The first detailed mode of action of repellents was summarized by <xref rid="iev025-B10" ref-type="bibr">Davis (1985)</xref>. Techniques were available for single cell recordings from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) on the antennae of mosquitoes, and a number of repellent compounds were tested for their activity on these cells. Based mostly on these electrophysiological studies, Davis hypothesized that repellents had their effect by modifying or blocking responses of ORNs normally sensitive to attractants. The same point was made by <xref rid="iev025-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dickens and Bohbot (2013)</xref>. In this study, one or more compounds should be responsible of modifying or blocking responses of ORNs normally sensitive to attractants.</p>
