In country like Nigeria, where foreign trading business and tourism are major sources of national income, people may use creams formulated with <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>L. camara</italic> MCE, HF, and EAFs, lonely or in combination as mosquito repellents at the place of DEET to increase their pleasure and comfort. In military operations, they may reduce the diseases and annoyance to personnel, who can then complete their operations more efficiently. They can therefore be viewed as a tool with a specific role in protecting people from mosquito-borne diseases. However, a lot of works need to be done: removing the greenness of the extracts and fractions, extend the work to other mosquito species though it is basically known that <italic>Aedes</italic> genus is the most resistant mosquito to repel, do further fractionation to get the molecule(s) mostly responsible of repellence, and field trial.</p>
