When adults of the same mosquito species were exposed to the concentration of 500&#8201;&#181;g/ml ethyl acetate and methanol extracts for 1&#8201;h, above 90% mortality was recorded after 24&#8201;h of recovery period (<xref rid="iev025-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chinnaperumal and Rahuman 2010</xref>). In Nigeria, formulated ointments from <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> leaf essential oil were tested against <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> on rat. The formulation results of 1&#8201;g of petroleum jelly in 1&#8201;ml and 1.5&#8201;ml of essential oil showed 100% protection and that in 0.5&#8201;ml essential oil, 93%. The toxicity study on the shaved rat skin showed no obvious effect for 3&#8201;wk (<xref rid="iev025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et&#160;al. 2011</xref>). In this study, 1&#8201;g of extract or fraction in 4&#8201;g of white soft paraffin provided total protection up to 120&#8201;min for MCE and 60&#8201;min for HF. No adverse effects were observed on the human volunteers throughout 3&#8201;wk after the application of the formulations. Confidence in the safety repellent efficiency of this study was thus established.</p>
