These diseases are transmitted to human beings through mosquito bite only. Prevention of mosquito bites is one of the main strategies to control or minimize incidence of these diseases. The use of insect repellents can provide practical and economical means of preventing mosquito-borne diseases and dead. It is important not only for local people in disease risk areas as Nigeria but also for travelers who are vulnerable to diseases spread by mosquito vectors when they visit and seek leisure away from their home countries. Many mosquito formulations have been made containing essential oil of plant materials (<xref rid="iev025-B13" ref-type="bibr">Egunyomi et&#160;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="iev025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et&#160;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="iev025-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adeniran and Fabiyi 2012</xref>, <xref rid="iev025-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dickens and Bohbot 2013</xref>). The inconvenient of such product is that essential oil has short time of effectiveness because of its rapid volatility. Vanillin is usually added to increase the protection time of the oils (<xref rid="iev025-B3" ref-type="bibr">Apiwat et&#160;al. 2001</xref>).
