This method allows an individual to select from (or combine) avoidance techniques, exclusion of mosquitoes with physical and chemical barriers, treatment of fabric with toxicants, and the use of topical (skin) repellents (<xref rid="iev025-B5" ref-type="bibr">Barnard and Xue 2004</xref>). Application of repellents to the skin is a common personal protection practice (<xref rid="iev025-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kazembe and Nkomo 2012</xref>). Numerous mosquito repellents under a variety of brand names are currently commercially available to consumers throughout the world. Most of them contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), which has broad-spectrum activity and effectively repels most mosquitoes, biting flies, chiggers, fleas, and ticks. It is the most effective insect repellent available for human use (<xref rid="iev025-B15" ref-type="bibr">Fradin and Day 2002</xref>). Currently, DEET is formulated in aerosols, pump sprays, lotions, creams, liquids, sticks, roll-ons, and impregnated towelettes, with concentrations ranging from 5 to 100%. However, DEET has shown adverse effects when applied as directed. The most common problem is local skin irritation, including erythema and pruritis, at the site of application. One case of anaphylaxis after brief exposure to DEET has been reported (<xref rid="iev025-B22" ref-type="bibr">Osimitz and Murphy 1997</xref>). Many people who applied high concentrations of DEET on a daily basis have developed more severe adverse effects due to chronic exposure. These adverse effects included insomnia, muscle cramps, mood disturbances, and rashes (<xref rid="iev025-B22" ref-type="bibr">Osimitz and Murphy 1997</xref>). For this reason, extracts of several plants have been studied as possible mosquito repellents revealing the existence of natural repellents with good efficacy (<xref rid="iev025-B14" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et&#160;al. 2011</xref>).</p>
