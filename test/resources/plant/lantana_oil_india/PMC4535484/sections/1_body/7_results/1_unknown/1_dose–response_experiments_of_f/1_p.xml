At 2&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> the lowest dose, the protection percent was 82%, whereas it was 63% and 47% for HF and MCE, respectively. The DEET control repelled female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> at 100% at the same dose of 2&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. At 6&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, no mosquito landed on exposed skin of volunteers, but it was at 8&#8201;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> that HF and MCE recorded the same results.
