Evidence – from the IPCC
The IPCC presents six main lines of evidence for climate change:
1. It has tracked the unprecedented recent rise in atmospheric CO and other GHGs since the beginning of the industrial
2
revolution.
• Since then, CO2 is up from 280 ppm to 387 ppm (40%) - highest for two million years.
• Methane up from 715 ppb in 1750 to 1,774 ppm in 2005 - highest for at least 650,000 years.
2. It knows from laboratory and atmospheric measurements that GHGs do indeed absorb heat when they are present in the
atmosphere.
3. It has tracked significant increase in global temperatures of 0.85°C and sea level rise of 20cm over the past century.
4. It has analysed the effects of natural events such as sunspots and volcanic eruptions on the climate, and though these are
essential to understand the pattern of temperature changes over the past 150 years, they cannot explain the overall warming
trend.
5. It has observed significant changes in the Earth’s climate system including
• reduced snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere
• retreat of sea ice in the Arctic
• retreating glaciers on all continents
• shrinking of the area covered by permafrost and the increasing depth of its active layer.
• All of which are consistent with a warming global climate.
6. It continually tracks global weather and has seen significant shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme events.
• Patterns of precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) have changed, with parts of North and South America, Europe and northern and central Asia
becoming wetter, while the Sahel region of central Africa, southern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia have become drier.
• Intense rainfall has become more frequent, along with major flooding.
• They’re also seeing more heat waves. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) between 1880 and the
beginning of 2014, the 13 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 16 years.
Latest reports are soon out of date, and things get clearer and worse

• coal-powered generation is expected to grow by 4.6% each year to 2024. India was the most prominent
objector to the “phase out” wording, but also had support from China.

They’re shouting, but no-one is listening
The United Nations
• Essentially toothless
• Emissions Gap Report 2022 (unep.org) (UN Environment Programme)
• Progress “woefully inadequate”. There is “no credible pathway to 1.5 degC”
• “.. in cold scientific terms, we have to stop filling our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, and stop doing it fast.
• “We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over.
• Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate
disaster.
• “[We must] almost halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Every fraction of a degree matters: to vulnerable
communities, to ecosystems, and to every one of us.”
Inger Andersen, the executive director UNEP
The IEA (International Energy Authority, not the right wing think tank)
• There is progress:
• CO from FF usage will peak in 2025 (the Ukraine war and Covid inflation have helped), ie. keep rising until then
2
• Clean energy Investment will grow 50% by 2030, reaching $2tn/yr
• BUT:
• This is half the $4tn/yr level needed by 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, and
• IEA’s own analysis matches UNEP – we’re headed for 2.5 degC on current policies

A climate expert’s view on the parlous state of public action

From iniquity to integrity … there’s no hiding from carbon budgets (climateseries.com)
Or search for:
Cambridge Climate Lecture Series
#CCLS2023 A Forum For Discussing Climate Change - Cambridge, UK
As climate change increasingly exacerbates extreme weather events around the globe, so government leaders are
increasingly using the language of a “climate emergency”. But look beyond the fine words, and it is quickly evident that
behind the relatively recent framing of ‘net zero’, many governments, companies and institutions are planning for little more
than incremental adjustments to business-as-usual.
But “nature will not be fooled” by empty rhetoric, subterfuge and unsubstantiated optimism – and nor should we. The
challenges we face in delivering on our Paris climate commitments beg fundamental questions of almost every facet of
modern society. This presentation will seek to lay bare the sheer scale, scope and urgency of emission cuts now required to
meet our Paris climate commitments. It will conclude by offering an outline of the key characteristics delivering on such
commitments needs to entail.
Please note, for those with a more sensitive disposition, this is very much a “red pill” presentation.
Much more eminent than me (100x) – but looks like I’m on the same page as him!
TL;DR: “I see no route out of this without revolution. The trouble is that by our inaction, we are choosing to
make that revolution a violent one.”

Tipping Points – Feedback Loops
• A feedback loop occurs where the output positively or negatively
affects the input, so leading either to:
• Self-regulating systems (like a pendulum swinging back to the mid-point)
• Systems that run out of control (like a fire spreading from a match-head)
• They occur all over the climate system, and interact – e.g. a slow river
cuts more into the outer bank than the inner, but eventually, an Ox-
Bow lake is formed.
• On the whole, in aggregate, the system self-regulates
• E.g. more heat → more cloud → more reflection → cooling back
• ….until recently.

Evidence, Tipping Points, New Tech and Projections
Tipping Points – Examples of Feedback Loops
Examples in the climate
• Albedo in the Arctic
• Rising temperatures are melting arctic sea ice
• Exposing more dark water to sunlight.
• Open water absorbs far more of the sun’s energy than ice, which reflects much of it
• leading to further warming. This results in more melting sea ice.
• Permafrost methane
• Methane and carbon can be found in Arctic permafrost, as well as in frozen peat bogs
and under sediment on the sea floor.
• As these bogs and permafrost thaw thanks to climate change, some of the methane and
carbon within is released into the atmosphere,
• adding yet more GHGs that can lead to further global warming.
• More warming results in more permafrost loss, and so on.

Tipping Points, and Examples of Tipping Points
• A tipping point is “a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes,
often abruptly and/or irreversibly.”
• When nudged, a glass settles back onto its base – until nudged hard enough to take
it past its tipping point. The glass topples.
• Not all tipping points lead to abrupt or irreversible change – but many do.
• The abrupt and irreversible ones are likely to cause the most harm.
• Examples:
The Greenland ice sheet
• may reach a point where it is committed to continue shrinking away. It won’t be
abrupt (200 yrs?) but it will be irreversible, and
• will raise sea levels globally – perhaps 1m every 50 years
• (less well known) will acidify oceans, massively disrupting food chains (and the Gulf Stream?)
The Amazon rainforest
• may shrink by 80% due to longer dry seasons and more droughts. This will be quick
(30 years?), hard to reverse, and devastating locally with impacts felt far away.

Tipping Points - Uncertainty is the Key Problem
• It’s all very complex, and we just don’t know
• But..
• "Many scientists are looking for the warning signs that herald sudden changes in
natural systems, in hopes of forestalling those changes, or improving our
preparations for them. Our new study found, unfortunately, that regime shifts
with potentially large consequences can happen without warning — systems can
‘tip’ precipitously. This means that some effects of global climate change on
ecosystems can be seen only once the effects are dramatic. By that point
returning the system to a desirable state will be difficult, if not impossible.”
Prof Alan Hastings, Davis Department of Environmental Science and Policy at Univ Calif.
(one of the world's top experts in using mathematical models to understand natural systems.)
• Which is why climate now is urgent (though the quotation is from 2010)
• We simply cannot know when nature might bite back, big time
• As Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry said.. “Do you feel lucky, punk?”

• In general…
• Realistic analysis concludes none of this will work fast enough
• It takes time to ramp up deployment – we have enough good tech we’re not using at scale

New Tech – Will Carbon Capture & Storage (“CCS”) ride to the rescue?
• 2022 global capacity for removing CO from the air was c 46M tonnes
2
• IEA projects this to grow to c 320M tonnes/yr by 2030
• A seven fold increase in 7 years..
• At which point it would still offset about 1% of global emissions
• Also (currently) expensive (c $400/tonne → c$150 by 2035 vs Euro
ETS c$75)
• Very much hyped by those who emit CO
2
• And on some conceptions, the point of capturing it is to enable increased
emissions!
• So… possibly promising one day far in the future, and definitely worth
working on
• But pretty much irrelevant when considering what to do right now

New Tech – Critical distinction
• “New Tech is irrelevant” is NOT the same thing as:
• “New Tech is irrelevant when considering what we need to do right now”
• The point is that “Tech will come along to save us” is a very seductive, very
effective tool to reduce and discourage action
• We indulge in this deception ourselves
• And we have it done to us
• Therefore, while new tech is great, almost every mention should
automatically raise a red flag in your head
• That huge caveat made, here’s a great site:
• Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge
• Initiative of Sir David King, eminent rational scientist and prophet of calamity ahead

Projections
• Now (post COP27)
• Current pledges for action by 2030, if delivered in full, would mean a rise in global heating of about 2.5
degC and catastrophic extreme weather around the world.
• A rise of 1 degC to date has already caused many climate disasters e.g. Pakistan floods.
• If the long-term pledges by countries to hit net zero emissions by 2050 were all delivered, global
temperature would rise by 1.8 degC.
• But the glacial pace of action means this was “not credible” (UNEP).
• In-force carbon-cutting policies would mean 2.8 degC of warming, while pledged policies cut this to 2.6
degC. Further pledges, dependent on funding flowing from richer to poorer countries, cut this again to
2.4 degC.
• “The [UNEP] report is a dire warning to all countries – none of whom are doing anywhere near enough to
manage the climate emergency.” Prof David King, former UK chief scientific adviser
• COP26 required countries to increase their pledges. But as COP27 loomed, only a couple of dozen had
done so, and
• Those new pledges would shave just 1% off emissions in 2030, while
• Global emissions must fall by almost 50% by that date to keep the 1.5 degC target alive.
• Additional pledges at COP27 were minimal (though finally it accepted the principle of aid/compensation)
• Future
• Takeaway is – the future is very grim indeed.

Conclusions
The evidence is overwhelming
Govts and Institutions are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic
• They’re NOT going to save us, until we ourselves show that we’ll destroy them if they don’t act
• Action must start now, and it must be radical
The projections we’ve seen are not set in stone
Viewed holistically, human society is like a Super tanker
• Except it doesn’t take 2 miles to stop
• It’s already taken 50 years NOT to slow down at all
• But unlike a Super tanker, it’s not the laws of physics here – it’s our own rules
Tipping points are a wild card
• Maybe we are already utterly doomed and no-one alive knows that yet
• More likely, we’ll find a way – but at what added cost (compared to current cost), due to yet further delay
• Let’s not gamble
Tech won’t save us, or even make much of a dent
• We need to turn off the tap first, and then find ways to pull out the plug (and mop the floor)
Every tenth of one degC matters - there is always something to play for
Anyone ignoring the problem, is part of the problem
