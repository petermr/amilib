The Key Systems
The Planetary Climate System - Summary of what we know
(Will cover more in lecture 3 but..) the IPCC presents six main lines of evidence for
climate change:
1. Unprecedented rise in GHGs since the beginning of the industrial revolution
2. GHGs do trap heat in the atmosphere
3. Significant rise in global temperature of 0.85°C and sea level rise of 20cm over the
past century
4. Sunspots, volcanic eruptions and other natural events cannot explain the overall
warming trend
5. There are significant changes in the Earth’s climate system, affecting snowfall, sea
ice, retreating glaciers, shrinking of permafrost - all consistent with a warming
global climate
6. There are significant shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme events
• Some regions wetter, others drier
• Intense rainfall has become more frequent, along with major flooding
• More heat waves
• The 13 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 16 years

Socio-Political Systems – other interactions with The Planetary Climate
Climate (heating) also directly drives other problems:
• Sea level rise from melting ice
• Ocean acidification à sea food shortages
• Drought, soil damage à land food shortages
And Humans help along many more:
• Biodiversity loss, deforestation
• Over-fishing
• Aquifer depletion
• Pollution (water, air, esp plastics)
And choose ways of life that further exacerbate:
• Unbridled Consumption/fast fashion
• Food waste, meat-eating

The Key Systems
Socio-Political Systems - Urgency
• How much time do we have?
• That depends on how much we do, and what we regard as acceptable loss
• If we want to prevent any species going extinct, and some human communities
being damaged, we are already far too late
• The effects are already being felt
• Climate breakdown is a supertanker; even if we activate all solutions, it will get worse first
• So it’s not a binary thing, it’s a spectrum
• What we are being told is that failure to make drastic change over this decade
(already nearly 1/3 over..) will risk tipping points
• Causing run-away change that we will struggle to contain or prevent
• I.e. in 10 years time, efforts may become futile.
• Plus, even if the scientists are totally wrong, “do you feel lucky”?
• Surely spending a few percent of our assets on insurance is just prudent?
• So we’d better start now

The Key Systems
Socio-Political Systems – Who is affected?
• Bankruptcy happens “slowly, then suddenly”
• Likewise, climate breakdown, in 3 different ways
• Slowly then suddenly, in time
• To a few, then suddenly many
• Faraway, then suddenly near
• Naomi Klein speaks of ‘Sacrifice Zones’
• E.g. The Niger Delta, Nauru, the North Atlantic Gyre, local coastal fishermen
• But some externalities can’t be contained (air pollution)
• And eventually, you need to expand or add new Sacrifice Zones
• And finally, everything is sacrificed
• “Only when the last river is poisoned and the last tree felled will we realise we can’t eat money”
• Will the UK be alright?
• Well, in a way. Better placed than many. But…
• When one, or two, billion people cannot thrive where they are, they will move. Today’s
‘immigration’ problems will pale in comparison
• If the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slows, we’ll notice..

The Key Systems
Socio-Political Systems – Climate Justice – a worked example
• Hurricane Katrina, as a case study of so-called “Disaster Capitalism”
• The Levies should have worked, but didn’t
• Because they mainly defended poor neighbourhoods
• At a time when the zeitgeist was (and had long been) “Shrink the Govt”
• The better off left town, used hotels, and called insurers
• Those without options, waited for aid
• 1,000 died waiting, 23,000 in the Superdome were 5 days without food or water
• The aid was slow and chaotic
• Political polarisation loyalty not competence or experience
à
• Those in charge saw the affected as feckless scroungers
• So the stranded waited, using up their own meagre resources. When gone, they went in
search. Without pay, and with shops closed, they couldn’t buy, so they took.
• Now they were seen as dangerous looters as well as scroungers. (“You loot, we shoot”)
• Aid resources were switched to ‘defending’ wealthy neighbourhoods
• Redevelopment
• Was done, but to big contractors
• With little and poor oversight
• Who didn’t hire locally (the homeless, jobless victims) – instead they used cheap labour
(often immigrant)
• Much public housing (without flood damage) was demolished – those renting them weren't
consulted and couldn’t afford the newer better housing
• Other social services were slashed (by $40bn) to pay for this contractor bonanza

The Key Systems
Socio-Political Systems – Climate Justice: Intergenerational Injustice (dull label, massive
issue)
• Triple whammy:
• Children are more vulnerable than adults (90% of CC diseases affect those under 5 yrs old)
• Children have no legal standing, we hold their rights for them. We are supposed to exercise those
rights for their good, not ours. But mainly:
• They’ll inherit our mess (and despise us for it)
• What right do we boomers have to burn all the remaining Carbon budget over the next 8 years?
• Because we’re still ‘in power’, and that’s the rate we’re going (and it’s still RISING)
• Younger people are damaged by uncertainties we never faced
• Not all are climate-related (tech etc) BUT
• 4 in 10 young people (16-25) fear having children
• Many see little point in planning far ahead – 75% say the future is “frightening”*
• And those are the ones in rich countries, not in the Zones already ‘sacrificed’.
• As for the impacts specific to Climate Breakdown on those outside the rich world**:
• Almost 160 million children are already exposed to high severe and prolonged droughts.
• The education of around 38 million children is disrupted each year.
• By 2040, it is estimated that one in four children will be living in areas with extreme water shortages
• By 2050, an extra 24 million children will be undernourished *Four in 10 young people fear having
children due to climate crisis | Climate crisis |
• By 2050, there could be 143 million more migrants The Guardian

The Key Systems
Socio-Political Systems – Climate Justice – why should we care?
• There’s the moral argument from history
• We did this
• Others are paying
• We can afford it, they can’t
• Plus the moral arguments about fairness (rich vs poor, old vs young)
• It’s the rich who get the profits, it’s the poor who get the blame
• Katrina was just inside one country
• But national borders aren’t relevant, and usually the affected poor live far away
• Destruction of a viable future for our children
• And the pragmatic arguments
• Relying as we do on global supply chains for food, energy, minerals etc
• Can we expect to just carry on regardless?
• Will the supply chains fail?
• Can we really insulate ourselves from catastrophes playing out abroad?
• Do we want to see a couple of billion people moving due to climate damage?
• Can we seriously expect to keep everyone out of our land?

The Key Systems
Economic Systems – Can Capitalism solve this?
I have been a believer in free market capitalism (FMC) most of my life, because:
• It has been THE driver of much progress over the past 300 years
• Making hay with Fossil Fuels, that fabulous store of concentrated, light, easily released energy
• It’s responsible for huge advances across multiple domains – health, transport, comfort, entertainment, ..
• There is no obviously better system for allocating resources efficiently
BUT, the danger is that we forget things:
• There ARE other options - it wasn’t always thus, and even now isn’t everywhere thus
• Capital accumulates in ever fewer hands, who thus acquire huge and largely hidden power (media barons, corporate
cash in politics, greenwash PR agents), which they use to promote the status quo as ‘the best of all possible worlds’
• They care for the hindmost only to the extent they’re needed (manufacturing, fighting), or get uppity
• Free markets are never free – there is always a set of people who set the rules (to someone’s advantage..)
• And they are bad at some things (natural monopolies/network effects, and pricing eco-damage & pollution)
• FMC is built on assumptions that worked really well in the past
• Nature is our servant, without secrets from us (cf. DDT)
• Nature shrugs at us, no matter what we do to it
• Resources are inexhaustible
• Pollution can be absorbed without limit
• These assumptions are no longer true
AND
• FMC appears to reward and require endless (and otherwise pointless, to FMC) growth, and manufactured needs.

The Key Systems
Economic Systems – Can Capitalism solve this?
Can we achieve the changes needed within the current politico-economic system?
• GDP is a terrible yardstick (counts bombs but not stable marriages)
• Happiness/wellbeing don’t correlate to income (beyond c. USD15k/yr)
• Capitalism
• Drives consumption directly, well-being only indirectly (if at all – FMC doesn’t care)
• Sniffs out opportunity, then the imperative is to create barriers
• Find an unserved (or poorly served) need, and meet that need, better or cheaper J
• But then
• Block others trying to meet it L
• Drive down your costs, which means…
• Always seeks to evade paying for externalities (resource damage, pollution)
• Always seeks to evade fair tax
• Is indifferent to inequality, and whether pay is fair – in fact, it prefers powerless people
• Is always on the hunt for new needs L
• Hence advertising/marketing
• FAR BEYOND: “here’s a great new thing” J
• AND MOSTLY NOW: make people dissatisfied, show them something ‘better’ L
• So who cares if products don’t last? Neither producers, nor consumers! L
• This means Planned Obsolescence – where you make sure your product will generate new demand

Recap on Systems
• The climate is warming
• It’s fast and unprecedented
• We are the primary cause
• A warmer climate is already causing disruption, and will cause increasingly
severe (even catastrophic) disruptions
• The impacts on biodiversity are becoming calamitous, and lethal to humanity
• The injustice is huge, unconscionable, and will catch up with us too
• We have gone to sleep, accepting “free market” capitalism because it’s part of
the furniture
• We may need to move away from (or radically restructure) it
• Much is already lost, but not all!
• We must do everything, now (if only as insurance)
