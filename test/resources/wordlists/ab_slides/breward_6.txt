What Humankind needs to do, and What to do (personal)
Introduction
A quick note on Mitigation vs Adaptation
• Mitigation is stopping it happening (putting a lock on the stable door, and using it)
• Adaptation is addressing the damage (using a bike instead now)
• M more conservative, less violent, and CHEAPER (but already, we need lots of A too – flood walls etc)
• The more we do M, the better state we’re in, and the less A we need.
• When it becomes obvious that A has become essential, the will to spend huge sums will follow.
• But the sums will be huger, and the damage to lifestyles huger, so let’s focus on M.
What Humanity needs to do (macro-scale – global, national)
• The scale of the problem (and the relative irrelevance of new technology)
• The uselessness of Governments
• What we need from Governments
• How do we give Governments a slap?
• It’s doable!
What you can do personally
• Personal/private actions (this week)

to?
“If govts are serious about the climate crisis, there can be NO NEW investments in Oil, Gas and
Coal, from NOW” Dr Fatih Birol, Exec Director International Energy Agency iea.org. And yet:
• Within the next few years, Qatar Energy, Gazprom, Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil,
Petrobras, Turkmengaz, Total, Chevron and Shell are planning to open NEW sites
• As part of its new energy strategy, the UK government has started licensing new
projects in the North Sea.
• Several major UK fossil fuel projects have been approved since Cop26
concluded, & about 50 schemes are thought to be in the pipeline between now
and 2025.
• We can’t rely on COPs – Egypt was a damp squib, the next one is in UAE!
• “World’s governments plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil
fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C”:

But we’re stuck for now with ‘Net’ Zero – which is better than ‘Non-Zero’…
But it still needs Governments to DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL….
We have the blueprint: the UK’s “sixth carbon budget” presented 2020 to the Govt by its own Committee on Climate
Change (the independent advisory committee set up under the 2008 Climate Change Act.

“They are completely and utterly gaslighting us. We have a lying government.” (Mary Portas)
If you watch one program, watch this one.
TL;DR:
• On-shore wind is cheapest solution, but Govt is too dependent on Big Oil to push back on NIMBYism
• Housing still being built is hopelessly behind the standards needed, buy Govt too dependent on Big Builders (20% of all
donations to Conservatives)
• Public is being told it’s all too expensive, when IT IS actually cheaper
• All despite broad approval in the UK for much more radical policies: Poll finds British public largely supports strong climate policies

What Humankind needs to do - The uselessness of Governments – Why are they
useless?
• Just 10 financial institutions own 50% of unburned fossil fuels:
https://www.newscientist.com/article/2332390-10-finance-firms-effectively-own-half-of-all-future-carbon-emissions/
• The Carbon Underground 200 is a list of the 200 largest fossil fuel companies.
• Combined, the companies own 98 per cent of known fossil fuel reserves, an amount that would
emit 674 gigatonnes of carbon if burned – nearly triple the global carbon emissions limits needed
to constrain global warming within the 1.5°C …
• Don’t be holding fossil fuel assets when these reserves become ‘stranded assets’.
• Governments are captured. They know what needs to happen. They just won’t / can’t
do it. For example in the UK…..
• Fossil fuels received £20bn more UK support than renewables since 2015 Guardian
2023 (Renewables: £60bn, FF: £80bn)

What Humankind needs to do - What do we need from Governments? The basics
• 1. Tell the Truth! And 2. Lead!
• “There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct,
or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction
of a new order of things.….the reformer has enemies in all those who
profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who
would profit by the new order” Machiavelli
• His solution was power. Today it’s persuasion/consent via media/voting…
• “Between equal rights, force decides” Marx
• In theory it’s one person one vote – in practice its one dollar one vote
• 3. Make Binding pledges to break cahoots with Big Oil (and Gas and Coal)
• Enact a legal obligation to reach net-zero à
NB: current scorecard is here: Net Zero Scorecard (eciu.net)
• But beware…
• While commitments must be real, and tracked, there is evidence that a
binding commitment gives Govts a smoke-screen – “Of course we are
serious, even though we’re approving this new oil field…”
• https://www.independent.co.uk/business/new-oil-and-gas-exploration-
good-for-environment-insists-climate-minister-b2197665.html
• Exploration continues: 2022 best year in a decade for new global oil
and gas discoveries (energyvoice.com)
• And as noted, NetZero is not enough, while offsets are such a scam.

What Humankind needs to do - What do we need from Governments? The specifics
Be radical with policies not just targets.
Five things every government needs to do right now to tackle the climate emergency
(theconversation.com)
Rebecca Willis, Universities of Exeter and Lancaster
1. Involve ALL departments
• Don’t sweep the issue away into a single ministry that then has to fight all others
• Each State Premier (PM etc) should co-ordinate climate action across all areas of government
• Don’t let one department hide, in reliance on others pulling the train (as currently in the UK)
2. Bring the public to the fore
• Involve and engage voters - use participatory forms of politics, such as Citizens’ Assemblies
• Don’t impose climate policies through stealth - profoundly undemocratic, and likely to backfire.
• People ARE willing to make changes in their own lives IF they see this as part of a wider national effort.
• Include groups who stand to lose (coal miners etc)
• with comprehensive support
• not just vague promises of green jobs

page ============ 15 ==========
What Humankind needs to do, and What to do (personal)
What Humankind needs to do - What do we need from Governments?
3. Implement “Symbolic” policies
• I.e. policies with tangible impacts that also raise the political profile of climate action
• Thus, send citizens and businesses a clear signal on future investment and priorities
• so catalysing radical, rather than incremental, change - e.g.:
• Allow/encourage individuals/groups to generate and sell renewable energy
• Ban advertising petrol and diesel cars
• Set personal and business carbon allowances – if fair, these will be popular (I’m doing it, why aren’t you?)
4. Keep it in the ground – cut FF exploration, production, subsidies
• Make explicit and tangible commitments to transition away from FFs
• Despite legal NZ targets in the UK and Norway, both plan to keep extracting
• But 1.5℃ requires us to leave most known FFs unburned
• Impose a moratorium on FF exploration
• End tax breaks for FF (USD 372 billion annually - globally), spend it helping transition
• Boost sustainable sources like wind and solar – now 85% cheaper since 2010
• Retire coal for good - NOW
5. Be both realistic and transparent about Carbon Capture & Storage (“CCS”)
• Keeping temperatures down isn’t possible without some form of removal, be it via trees or air filtering machines. BUT..
• Spell out, and separate out, the contribution of negative emissions technologies (eg CCS) to net zero targets
• Don’t rely on it - CCS may not be feasible, economically
• and distracts resources - and attention - away from reducing emissions

6. Curb demand
• Reduce demand for energy in the areas of shelter, mobility and nutrition – via tax, subsidies, public education, ..
• low carbon diets
• food waste
• how we build/adapt our cities
• how we shift people to more carbon friendly transport options
• electric cars can make a big difference - but need investment in charging technology to speed the uptake
7. Recognise the TRUE economic costs and benefits (of FFs and resources vs sustainables and circular economy)
• If we incorporate the economic damages caused by climate change, the global cost of limiting warming to 2°C over this
century is lower than the global economic benefits of reducing warming
• Keeping temperatures well under 2°C costs a bit more, but not much, if the avoided damages, and wide range of co-benefits such as
cleaner air and water are correctly priced
• "If you take the most aggressive scenarios in the entire report, it would cost at most 0.1% of the rate of annual GDP growth assumed“:
Prof Michael Grubb, co-ordinating lead author of the IPCC report
8. Pressure the Rich
• They have an outsized impact - 10% of households contribute 45% of consumption-based household GHG emissions
• So they can make the biggest impact by reducing
• Especially on transport - including on private jets. Tax this more (why is kerosene STILL untaxed??)
• They also have most influence – as role models, investors and lobbyists
• This is true at global level (we’re all in that 10%), but also within countries (where not all of us are)
• top 1% of UK earners produce TWENTY TIMES more emissions than the bottom 10% Guardian Nov 2022
• richest 1% (global) account for more carbon emissions than poorest 66% Guardian Nov 2023

What Humankind needs to do - It’s doable! – Breakthroughs/Tipping Points
Three “super-leverage points” could trigger a cascade of tipping points for zero-carbon solutions in sectors covering
70% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report: The-Breakthrough-Effect.pdf (systemiq.earth)
• Electric cars
• Policies:
• zero emission vehicle mandates
• accelerated build out of charging infrastructure
• Knock-on effect: volume production à cheaper batteries and charging (below FF car costs)
• Green ammonia (GnA) use in fertiliser production (vs grey ammonia from FFs, currently 2/3 the cost)
• Policy: introducing a 25% blending mandate globally
• Knock-on effect:
• cheaper hydrogen, due to volume production to make GnA (hence also making GnA cheapest option, so mandate can be retired)
• GnA becomes viable to power shipping
• green hydrogen becomes viable in steel production (to replace coking coal)
• Plant-based meat
• Policies (to double market share to 20% by 2035):
• public procurement
• public investment in research and development
• Knock-on effects:
• free-ups c10% of all agricultural land in use today
• tips the economic value of deforesting land, to below that of protecting it.

What to do (personal) - Personal/private actions
What can I do to stop climate change? | New Internationalist
“Lifestyle changes are no substitute for collective action. But personal carbon-cutting still matters – it’s a powerful way to signal
the climate emergency to those around us, move the needle on policy and set bigger cultural changes in motion.”
Mike Berners-Lee
So while collective action is the critical thing, personal actions help, because:
• They contribute (a bit)
• They influence others
• They help you start conversations
• They make it easier for others to follow
• They remind you what’s at stake

Cheese, sadly, cannot be
better than Milk – and
nb Milk is above pork!
1. Adjust your diet
• Cut out meat/dairy, esp beef/lamb – there are tasty low carbon alternatives
• Eat all you buy (food waste is 8% of GHGs)
• Avoid air-freighted/out-of-season food (berries, mange-tout, asparagus, ..)
• Avoid frozen ready-meals

What to do (personal) - Personal/private actions – Steps 2-3
2. De-carbonize your travel
• Fly less or, better still, stop - a return trip UK-Australia = 3-4 years of running a car
• BTW, only about 2-4% of the global population flies even once, in any year.
• Cut car use (walk, cycle, use public transport, share, work from home)
• Drive a small car slowly – driving at 80mph is 50% worse than 60mph
• Go electric or plug-in hybrid – but nb 1/3 of car damage is from building it… so old, efficient car can be
better
3. Consume less, and wisely
• Buy less junk
• Buy local
• Check supply chains for carbon responsibility, fair livelihoods and other sustainability
• Buy what lasts, and is repairable
• Repair before replacing - Cambridgeshire Repair Cafes - Cambridge Carbon Footprint (3 before Xmas!)
• Sell on or give away unwanted stuff - Gumtree | Free classified ads from the #1 classifieds site in the UK
• Choose energy-efficient white goods - if you use the oven, cook two things
• Locate your freezer (and fridge?) in a cool place if poss
• Carry a reusable cup/water bottle

What to do (personal) - Personal/private actions – Steps 4-5
4. Cut home energy use
• Buy electricity from a real green energy provider
• Lower the thermostat, turn off peripheral radiators
• Wear a jumper/woolly hat indoors (it’s not hard :)
• Insulate (drafts first, then loft, windows, walls)
• Install smart heating (efficient boilers, remote controls that include radiators), solar panels, heat pumps
• Avoid tumble drying
• Wash fabric at 30degC
• Avoid very hot or long showers
• Turn lights off
5. Clean up investments [THIS MAY BE BY FAR THE BIGGEST, IF YOU HAVE A LARGE PENSION POT]
• Use pension and saving schemes that don’t touch fossil fuel companies
• Invest in renewables and reforestation
• Make sure your advisors/providers get at least one letter saying you want to avoid FFs and they need to do a
better job of offering such options, in an accessible/intuitive/clear way
• Make My Money Matter - your pension is powerful – initiative to help you check/switch pension, claiming that
doing this is doing 21x more than stopping flying, going veggie and switching energy supplier, combined!

Plenty more out there but here are a few ideas. Research carefully before any commitment –
these are not recommendations..
• Shared Interest Ethical Investment Co-operative (shared-interest.com) – “provides financial
services and business support to make livelihoods and living standards better for people as
they trade their way out of poverty” (not specifically anti-FF, but focused on sustainability and
a generally good egg)
• The Big Exchange | The home of ethical & impact investing - makes it easier to choose funds
that are investing in companies creating positive solutions to combat the world's biggest
challenges. Offer ISAs
• Banking for good (triodos.co.uk) - empowering customers to put people and the planet first
with their everyday banking and investments (current accounts and investment funds)
Moving your money may be the single biggest thing you can so. And once you’ve done it, it’s an
easy one to talk about, to others.

page ============ 26 ==========
What Humankind needs to do, and What to do (personal)
What to do (personal) - Personal/private actions – Steps 6-9
6. Talk about it (See resources on having good conversations)
• Take your low-carbon mindset to work, to the pub and into your own household
• Be friendly but don’t let that get in the way of clarity
• Help create a culture that frowns on ignoring climate change – as with smoking, drunk driving
• Talk to tradesmen, shopkeepers, taxi drivers, ..
7. Use your power
• Make sure politicians hear - well in advance of elections - that we insist on coherent and strong climate policies (More next week)
• What other powers do you have? E.g. pension-switching (5 above)
“The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.”
Alice Walker (author of The Color Purple)
8. Do all of the above
• It’s an emergency
• Put a plan in place and work your way through it
• Keep going!
9. Be kind to yourself
• Don’t beat yourself up
• Just keep moving in the right direction and enjoy it – there is NO BETTER USE OF YOUR TIME

What to do (personal) - Personal/private actions – Why Group action matters
more
I’m doing my bit, why do I need to engage in Group actions?
• Because even in aggregate, personal actions won’t be enough, or fast enough
• Because we need to change
1. Public Attitudes and hence
2. Politicians, and hence
3. Businesses, and hence
4. Polluting behaviour (resource extraction and waste production)
5. The availability of decent alternatives to high-carbon activities
• As explained, our institutions won’t act unless we (via Public Attitudes):
• Push them into acting, OR
• Burn them down and build different ones
And to do that, at the pace we need to see, we need to act in groups.
• Also, bluntly, because it is our duty
• Age is no barrier. In fact it helps – we have more
• Money
• Time
• Influence/networks
• And perhaps also Wisdom (to fix the mistakes we made on the way!)
