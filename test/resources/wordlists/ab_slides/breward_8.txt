Tools – Carbon Footprints
The grubby history:
• British Petroleum (18,700 petrol stations worldwide), hired PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to promote the slant
that climate change is not the fault of an oil giant, but that of individuals. BP first promoted and soon
successfully popularized the term “carbon footprint” in the early 2000s. The company unveiled its “carbon
footprint calculator” in 2004 so one could assess how their normal daily life – going to work, buying food,
and (gasp) traveling – is largely responsible for heating the globe.
United States 15.5
Japan 9.5
Nevertheless, if done correctly, and NOT used to pass the buck,
they’re a useful tool. Russia 9.3
Germany 9.2
Global footprints
• Measured in Tonnes of CO per capita China 7.0
2
• Consumption-based emissions : (Tonnes/person/yr) Wikipedia
United Kingdom 6.9
• (Production-based figures flatter rich service economies because
we’ve offshored dirty production and import the goods instead France 5.8
eg UK around 6, US around 16)
India 1.6
• NB. 2020 data. Things change.
Pakistan 1.0
World 4.7

My approx. calc: 8.0-9.5 vs UK ave 13.1
Tools – Carbon Footprints
Can’t get it down much further, without change
around me, from Corps/Govts etc.
Things you can affect yourself: • Note 13.1 is much higher than Wikipedia number
(prev slide) 8.5. I don’t know why. Perhaps SWC
is including (our share of relevant) international
shipping &aviation? Also, no calcs should be
treated as gospel – turning human lifestyle into
Tonnes of CO involves many underlying
2
assumptions.
• Still, a decent guide on what to cut down
• UPDATE: SWC seems to have stopped publishing
its CF Calculator (not their core business as a
consultancy)
• So try the WWF Footprint Calculator (I scored
6.8-8.7, UK ave 9.5 – more in line with Wiki
data)

Tools – Offsetting
Offsetting is the act of doing something (usually donating) to effect a reduction in CO emissions equal to the
2
emissions from whatever is to be offset.
• E.g. return flight from London to Australia via Tokyo emits 8,658 kg CO₂ (using Offset your flight – atmosfair)
• (which is the total life-time emissions of a 17 year old Ethiopian!)
• So that’s the amount to be offset
• You can either
• pay the stated cost for offsetting to a non-profit like atmosfair (their number is €244 or about £215), or
• go to another site, e.g. www.goldstandard.org and find a project you want to support, e.g. “Improved Cookstoves in
Guinea” priced at USD20/tonne, i.e. USD180 (about £145) for the 9 tonnes you need
• Of course you can offset less than your full emissions, or more
• Beware cheap offsets – e.g. offered by the airline itself
• Treat with great caution:
• offset projects that involve protecting forests
• the use of offsets by corporates to allow continued polluting behaviour
• Not automatically wrong, but there is a strong tendency toward greenwashing.
• And avoid falling into the trap “well, it’s offset so I can do as much as I like!”
• Offsetting is not a magic bullet, just a balancing of a specific harm.
• See further, e.g., Greenwashing or a net zero necessity? Climate scientists on carbon offsetting
• “there is no emissions space for companies to use offsetting as a means of further locking in high-carbon activities,
technologies, norms and practices, even under the heroic assumption that offsetting actually works. Put simply, we need
to pull every mitigation level to its max level; there is no longer any give or flexibility in the system.”

Tools – Thinking differently – the Doughnut
Oxford economist Kate Raworth has set out seven principles for thinking like a 21st-century economist in order to
bring the world’s economies into a safe and just space for humanity:
• Embrace a new goal. Our economies are currently based on the goal of endless GDP growth, which fails to meet all
our needs as it damages our planet. It is time to work toward a new goal: thriving in a safe and just space, or, as we
like to call it, getting into the Doughnut!
• See the big picture. We often hear about the power of the market to provide for us, but we must take a step back
to see the big picture of the economy as embedded within, and dependent upon, society and the living world.
• Nurture human nature. Doughnut Economics recognizes that humans aren’t just self-centered, acting in isolation,
or behaving in predictably “rational” ways, but are caring beings, adapting to their social context, and can nurture
cooperation.
• Think in systems. Doughnut Economics understands that economies are nonlinear complex adaptive systems like
the roots of a forest, with independent agents, and not based on linear, reductionistic, or equilibrium models like
the cogs of a machine.
• Be distributive. Extreme inequality is a design failure of our current economic system. We recognize that there are
many ways to design economies to be far more distributive of value among those who help to generate it.
• Be regenerative. Environmental degradation is the result of degenerative industrial design. We can create a truly
circular economy instead of thinking that someone else will clean up our mess.
• Aim to thrive rather than to grow. It is time for us to recognize that nothing grows forever – living systems also
need time to mature. Doughnut Economics rejects the idea that economies should grow whether or not they make
us thrive, and advocates for an economy that makes us thrive whether or not it grows.

Tools – Thinking differently – Degrowth
Sustainable degrowth:
• Is a downscaling of production and consumption that increaseshuman well-being and enhances
• ecological conditions, and
• equity on the planet
• Calls for a future where societies live
• within their ecological means
• with open, localized economies
• with resources more equally distributed through new forms of democratic institutions
• so that societies no longer have to “grow or die”
• Relegates materialaccumulationfrom prime position in the population’s cultural imagery.
• With a focus onsufficiencynot efficiency
• With innovation focused on new social and technical arrangements that will enable us to live convivially and frugally
• [“PrivateSufficiencyandPublicWealth”: George Monbiot]
• Removes GDP as the overarching policy objective and builds towards
• alowerbutsustainablelevel of production and consumption
• a shrinking of the economic system to leave more space for human cooperation and ecosystems
• [GDP is a lousy proxy for well-being:
• Car crashes & drug rehabs raise it. Happy marriages & clean air don’t. Natural wilderness is WORTHLESS, until paved over.
• Where a billionaire gets a trivial £200 and a pauper loses a vital £199, that’spositive.]
• Is built around acceptance that “people should live simplyso others, human and non-human may simply live”
www.degrowth.org - research, training, awareness raising and events organization around degrowth .
• The key point is that degrowth is a bad name for a seriously timely (essential?) idea.

Tools, Q&A and Plans
Tools – How to talk about CC
People are affected by who they talk to – talking is important, especially 1-1
There are many guides and resources, all covering similar ground
I’ll summarise four
• I won’t cover Have the Talk: Climate Conversations (by NOAA Climate.gov) - the most detailed and
comprehensive - but it’s available here if you plan to get serious and do a lot of talking!

Tools, Q&A and Plans
Tools – How to talk about CC - Messaging
Talk-Like-a-Human.pdf (potentialenergycoalition.org)
1. Talk like a human - Regular people aren’t policy wonks. Connect using language they understand.
• Words to avoid: • Decarbonization • Net zero • Anthropogenic • Green house gasses • Carbon footprint • 1.5 degrees • 100 year
storm (what is that?)
• Words to use: • Pollution • Overheating • Extreme weather • Costing people too much • The hottest year on record
2. Don’t exaggerate The truth is motivating enough. Catastrophe messaging can be polarizing especially if it
seems like it comes with a political agenda. The key is to make the connection so people understand it on their
own, rather than yell “CRISIS!” Be the rational source during the storm.
3. No partisanship Language can be political. Be mindful of perpetuating triggering tropes. Use language that
appeals equally to conservative and progressive values. Simply saying “it’s not political” immediately lowers
people’s defenses
4. Keep it local We care about what we experience. Tie climate change to its real consequences. Avoid ‘Planetary’
5. Humans, not concepts People care about people, not abstract concepts. Spare us the theoreticals: global
competitiveness, green innovation boom, economic leadership arguments. What works is that people like me are
being affected
6. Fight pollution, not climate change We aren’t fighting climate change. We are fighting the polluters who are
causing climate change
7. Focus on today The future is easy to ignore. What’s happening now matters now. Avoid ‘2030’, ‘2040’ etc.
8. Messengers make the message People are more likely to trust information from trustworthy sources. Those
still exist

Tools – How to talk about CC - Tactics
A. The #TalkingClimate Handbook
https://climateoutreach.org/reports/how-to-have-a-climate-change-conversation-talking-climate/
• Good conversations aren’t about exchanging data or winning an argument - they are about
• Collaboration – seeing the whole person, engaging an issue together
• Ending with everyone feeling they’ve been understood – and sorry it’s over (not relieved!)
• Conversations about climate change are no different.
• Follow these principles (“REALTALK”):
• Respect your conversational partner and find common ground
• Enjoy the conversation
• Ask questions
• Listen, and show you’ve heard
• Tell your story (why you’re concerned, what you’re doing)
• Action (on your part) makes it easier (to start conversations)
• Learn from the conversation
• Keep going and keep connected

Tools – How to talk about CC - Tactics
B. From the ClientEarth Handbook (not online, as it’s a recruiting tool so they ask you to register, but I can supply)
1. Ask questions
• show them you’re interested in them, not just waiting to speak
• And learn about them, what kind of thing lights their candle – so you can….
2. Reframe the issue – make it about something close by and immediate, not distant and future, e.g.:
• Health (air pollution, heat exhaustion, …)
• the Economy
• the Environment
or (more personally to them):
• maintaining a Good Lifestyle
• it’s a common misinformed trope that climate action is expensive, but compared to inaction, it’s CHEAP
• There are multiple potential benefits not costed into cold GDP figures, like community, leisure, fairness, that all flow from Climate Action
• reacquiring a sense of Security, getting rid of anxiety (finally, we are DOING something)
• our Children!
3. Tell convincing stories
• anecdotes, not data (humans respond much more deeply to human stories)
4. Know your stuff
• embed about 10 basic facts in your head (impactful ones, not dry statistics)
5. Keep calm
• Rome wasn’t built in a day

Tools – How to talk about CC - Goals
C. From training materials for Union recruitment - adapted for CC
• Structuring a conversation: AHA!
• Anger – find what specifically lights their fuse - e.g. is it:
• destruction of nature/birdlife/insects
• the cost to the economy
• human suffering by kids in developing countries?
Ask them – they’ll tell you!
• Hope – give them hope that there are ways to solve/alleviate the problem
• Action - outline possible actions that can help - that they can support/get involved in
• In discussion, when an objection or diversion is raised: AARgh!
• Affirm – don’t disrespect the objection, rather acknowledge it (e.g. “Yes a lot of people
express that concern”)
• Answer – provide substantive replies that defuse or reduce the importance of the
objection (i.e. it’s not a slam dunk objection)
• Refocus – return to what lights their fuse, get them hooked (on the hope and action)

Tools, Q&A and Plans
Tools – arm yourself with some optimism!
There is progress…
• China is serious, solar is ramping fast everwhere
• We are weening ourselves off coal, and even gas. (IEA forecasts)
• Germany can reach 100% ‘clean energy’ by 2035 for less than fossil fuel spending | by RethinkX, disruptive technology think tank
Germany can shift its entire electricity system onto solar, wind and batteries by 2030 for less than 1% of its GDP.
Its entire energy system can go 100% clean energy by 2035 for less than what it spends on fossil fuels.
In 10–15 years, Germany can permanently end dependence on fossil fuels. (And if they can, so can we!)
