1,introduction,"Introduction The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key component of the Earth’s climate system, is crucial in regulating climate by redistributing heat across ocean basins. The Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection was often thought to play an important role in AMOC changes 1 – 3 . For example, in some previous water hosing experiments, the external freshwater flux is released broadly over the entire subpolar North Atlantic and directly covers the interior Labrador Sea deep convection site, causing the weakening and shutdown of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection and associated subsurface warming that further drives the AMOC weakening 4 , 5 . However, the AMOC and the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection exhibit different tipping behaviors in climate models 6  and the importance of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection in the AMOC has been challenged 7 – 16 . Previous studies have shown that the net sinking induced by the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection is negligible, the contribution to the AMOC from the Labrador Sea is mainly from boundary sinking, and the impact of the open-ocean deep convection on the AMOC has to be indirect through eddy mixing with boundary properties 7 , 8 , 11 – 16 . Hence the AMOC (associated with the net sinking) and open-ocean deep convection (with little direct contribution to the net sinking) involve different physical processes. Recent observations from the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) show that the AMOC across OSNAP East, rather than the AMOC across OSNAP West, is the dominant component of the subpolar AMOC 17 – 19 . The observational-based Robust Diagnostic Calculations also show that the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection contributes minimally to the long-term mean AMOC strength 20 . These findings question the pronounced role of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection in the AMOC. A recent study 21  shows that the relative role of the Labrador Sea deep convection in multidecadal AMOC variability is model dependent: in the model with unrealistically strong/wide mean state Labrador Sea deep convection, multidecadal AMOC variability is dominated by multidecadal variability in the Labrador Sea deep convection; whereas in the model with a relatively weak/narrow mean state Labrador Sea deep convection, multidecadal AMOC variability is dominated by multidecadal Arctic salinity variability. The model with unrealistically strong/wide mean state Labrador Sea deep convection has a higher-than-observed density along the Labrador Sea boundary outflow and overestimates the mean state AMOC across OSNAP West 22 – 24 . The dominant role of the Labrador Sea deep convection in multidecadal AMOC variability might also be overestimated in models with overestimated mean state AMOC across OSNAP West due to modeling deficiencies in separating the boundary outflow from unrealistically strong/wide deep convection in the Labrador Sea. The Labrador Sea Water (LSW) is formed through winter deep convective mixing, which is often driven by strong surface heat losses 25 , 26 . The spread of the LSW is important for ventilating the interior intermediate-depth ocean 27 , 28 . Beneath the LSW lies the Northeast Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) layer, modified from the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) that flows into the subpolar North Atlantic through the Iceland-Scotland Ridge from the Nordic Sea. The Iceland-Scotland overflow is an important deep branch of the AMOC 29  and can affect the westward contraction/eastward expansion of the subpolar gyre in the upper North Atlantic 30 . As the ISOW crosses the Faroe Bank Channel into the Iceland Basin, it is modified by the warm and saline water in the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic, transporting relatively saltier water downward into the deep Labrador Sea along multiple interior downstream Iceland-Scotland overflow pathways 20 , 31 , 32  and forming the NEADW layer in the deep Labrador Sea 33 . This downward propagation/entrainment process of the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic water properties into the ISOW is also supported by recent observations 34 . Previous studies have focused on the role of surface buoyancy loss in affecting Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection 25 , 26 , 35 , and the influence of ISOW on the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection changes receives less attention. In the abyssal layer of the Labrador Sea, the coldest and densest Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) resides. The DSOW flows into the subpolar North Atlantic through the Denmark Strait from the Nordic Sea and travels to the Labrador Sea’s bottom layer along the western boundary of the Irminger Sea and the Labrador Sea. In this work, we aim to explore if it is possible to have an alternative relationship between the AMOC change and the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection change in response to the external freshwater forcing applied over the southern Nordic Sea where there is no open-ocean deep convection (see Methods section). We employ an advanced coupled climate model that can simulate more realistic ocean boundary currents and deep overflows (see Methods section) to unravel the intricate dynamics governing the AMOC response and its relationship with the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection response. Our study also reveals how the external freshwater forcing applied over the southern Nordic Sea alters the density and the flow strength of the ISOW, and ultimately affects the open-ocean deep convection strength in the Labrador Sea."
2,results,"Results The weakening of the AMOC and the strengthening of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection With 0.05 Sv of external freshwater flux added over the southern Nordic Sea for the entire 80-year duration of the experiment (see Methods section), the maximum AMOC across the OSNAP section weakens by about 2.6 Sv (significant with 95% confidence) averaged over the last 40 years (Fig.  1a ), which is ~15% of the climatology maximum AMOC (17.2 Sv) averaged over the last 40 years in the corresponding control simulation.

Black lines represent the control simulation. Blue lines represent the water hosing experiment. Red lines represent anomalies (water hosing—control). The last 40-year average is used. The AMOC declines across a broad range of latitudes (extending from the subpolar region to the low latitudes) and the decline is larger across subpolar latitudes than that across low latitudes (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The AMOC weakening across the OSNAP section is dominated by that across OSNAP East, with minimal contribution from the OSNAP West component (Figs.  1 b,  2 ), though the control simulation overestimates the density-space AMOC strength across OSNAP West (see Methods section). This result is consistent with recent OSNAP observations 17 , 19  that the AMOC across OSNAP East dominates the AMOC across the entire section. In contrast to previous studies attributing the AMOC weakening to the shutdown of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection and associated subpolar subsurface warming 4 , 5 , our study reveals a distinct AMOC weakening mechanism that does not coincide with the reduction of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection (Fig.  1a, c, d, e ). Here the AMOC weakening is associated with the subsurface cooling (Fig.  3e , Supplementary Fig.  2 ), rather than the subsurface warming over the subpolar North Atlantic as found in previous water hosing experiments 4 , 5 . Our results are also consistent with observational analyses suggesting that the inferred historical weak AMOC phase is associated with the time-lagged subsurface cooling over the central Labrador Sea and vice versa 36 .

The last 40-year average is used. The central Labrador Sea March mixed layer depth (MLD) does not decline in the first 40 years and even has a statistically significant increase averaged over the last 40 years (Fig.  1c, e ), indicating that the Labrador Sea open-ocean winter deep convection strengthens, though the AMOC declines in response to the external freshwater forcing. The strengthening of the winter deep convection spreads over the open ocean in the Labrador Sea and Irminger Sea (Fig.  1e ). Thus, the AMOC weakening (Figs.  1 a,  2c ) is opposite to the strengthening of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection (Fig.  1c, e ). Even the modest reduction of the AMOC across the Labrador Sea (OSNAP West, Figs.  1 b,  2a ) is also opposite to the strengthening of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection (Fig.  1c, e ). These results are consistent with previous analyses showing that the AMOC (associated with the net sinking) and open-ocean deep convection (with little direct contribution to the net sinking) involve different physical processes 7 , 8 , 11 – 16 . The role of water mass transformation in the AMOC weakening The Water mass transformation (WMT) refers to the diabatic processes by which water masses transform from one density class to another, influencing/balancing the large-scale ocean circulation such as the AMOC 37 . The WMT includes the surface forced (WMT S ) and the interior mixing forced (WMT M ) components (see Methods section for the calculation methods). We investigate how the long-term mean surface and interior mixing forced water mass transformation (WMT S  and WMT M ) changes influence/balance the long-term mean density-space AMOC decline. Averaged over the last 40 years, the AMOC decline across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge (GSR) (Supplementary Fig.  3c ) is affected by both WMT S  and WMT M  anomalies northeast of GSR that often counter each other at various density levels (Supplementary Fig.  3i ). In the Iceland-Irminger Seas (IIS), the total WMT anomaly is mainly dominated by the WMT M  anomaly, with little change in the WMT S  anomaly (Supplementary Fig.  3b, h ). The AMOC decline across OSNAP East (Supplementary Fig.  3a ) is mainly balanced by the WMT S  decline occurring in large part remotely northeast of GSR at the relatively dense level around 27.84  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				\begin{document}$${{{\rm{kg}}}}\,{{{\rm{m}}}}^{-3}$$\end{document} kg m − 3  (Supplementary Fig.  3a, g ), because the WMT M  anomalies for the IIS region and the region northeast of GSR are almost canceled at this density level. The above long-term mean balance does not necessarily apply to the transient evolution: at the relatively dense level, the WMT S  decline northeast of GSR reaches equilibrium much earlier around 20 years, whereas the AMOC decline across OSNAP East in the corresponding deep ocean has a much longer decline timescale of more than 40 years (discussed in a later subsection). The horizontal circulation contribution to the AMOC weakening across OSNAP East In the control simulation, the climatological maximum AMOC in density space is much larger than that in depth space across OSNAP East (Fig.  2b, e ) due to the contribution from the cyclonic horizontal circulation across sloping isopycnals, which can be estimated from the difference between the density-space and depth-space AMOC 20 . Across OSNAP East, the largest AMOC reduction is at a relatively dense level around  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				\begin{document}$${\sigma }_{0}=27.84\,{{{\rm{kg}}}}\,{{{\rm{m}}}}^{-3}$$\end{document} σ 0 = 27.84 kg m − 3  (Fig.  2b , which on average is around 2000m). At this relatively dense level, the depth-space AMOC has little reduction (i.e. 0.8 Sv around 2000m) (Fig.  2e ); instead, the reduction of the horizontal circulation contribution (4.9 Sv) dominates the total density-space AMOC reduction of 5.7 Sv (Fig.  2b, e ). To understand the horizontal circulation contribution to the AMOC weakening across OSNAP East, we calculate the  σ - z  diagram of the AMOC transport across OSNAP East (Fig.  4 ) based upon the AMOC diagnostics developed by Zhang and Thomas 20 . The  σ – z  diagram for the control simulation (Fig.  4a ) resembles the observational-based  σ - z  diagram across OSNAP East 20 . In the climatological mean state, the cyclonic abyssal circulation in the deep North Atlantic 38  across sloping isopycnals includes the relatively denser southward western boundary current and the relatively lighter northward current near the eastern boundary at the same depth in the deep ocean across OSNAP East (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). It contributes substantially to the density-space AMOC at the relatively dense level (Fig.  2b, e ; Fig.  4a ), an observed feature that is often missing in climate models 20 . In response to the external freshwater forcing, the largest volume transport reduction happens at the relatively dense level (Fig.  4c ). However, the volume transport change is almost canceled at the deep depth level and thus there is little net depth-space volume transport change in the deep ocean summed over the entire density range. The opposite volume transport changes at the same depth level but different density levels are related to the flattening of isopycnals (i.e., reduction of the west-east density contrast) in the deep ocean (Figs.  3 c, f,  4c ). Therefore, the  σ - z  diagram further supports our findings that the reduction of the horizontal circulation contribution dominates the reduction of the AMOC across OSNAP East at the relatively dense level.

In ( a ,  b ), the shaded color represents the integrated volume transport (Sv) across OSNAP East over each potential density ( σ 0 ) bin ( x -axis) and depth ( z ) bin ( y -axis). The blue curve above illustrates the sum of the volume transport over the full depth range at each potential density bin. The blue curve on the left side shows the sum of the volume transport over the entire range of potential density at each depth bin. The accumulated AMOC transport in density- and depth- space corresponds to the AMOC streamfunction across OSNAP East, as depicted in Fig.  2b, e . The  σ – z  diagram of AMOC transport (Sv) and its interpretation is adapted from Zhang and Thomas 20 . The last 40-year average is shown. The reduction of the horizontal circulation contribution dominates the reduction of the AMOC across OSNAP East at the relatively dense level ( c ). The transient AMOC decline across OSNAP East In this subsection, we focus on understanding the transient AMOC decline in response to the external freshwater forcing.

The 11-year running mean is used. The density decreases in the western boundary of OSNAP East, and it is dominated by the freshening (Figs.  3 ,  5 , Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The externally forced freshwater anomaly in the southern Nordic Sea suppresses upper ocean mixing and induces a cold anomaly there, which spreads into the North Atlantic along with the freshwater anomaly and provides a density compensation to the freshening (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Additionally, the initial AMOC weakening induces enduring cooling in the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.  2 ) due to reduced poleward ocean heat transport and the eastward shift of the North Atlantic current (NAC) pathway as found in previous studies 39 – 44 . Part of the cold anomaly is entrained into the deep eastern subpolar North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). In the deep ocean, the density decline in the western boundary is dominated by the freshening (Fig.  5a ), whereas the eastern part experiences a nearly full density compensation between cooling and freshening, resulting in a negligible density change (Fig.  5b ). Despite the dominance of freshening in the deep western boundary density decline (Fig.  5a ), the freshening in the eastern side gradually develops in the deep ocean (Fig.  5b ), so the contribution of freshening to the overall decline in the deep ocean west–east density contrast is relatively smaller after ~35 years (Fig.  5c ). Instead, it is the more pronounced and enduring cooling in the eastern part compared to the western boundary (red lines in Fig.  5a, b ) that primarily contributes to the decline in the deep ocean west–east density contrast after ~35 years (Fig.  5c ). The evolution of salt-based and dye-based freshwater fraction anomalies To understand the transient oceanic response to the external freshwater forcing, it is important to understand the evolution of freshwater fraction anomalies. With the passive tracer (dye) added at the same rate and location over the southern Nordic Sea as the external freshwater flux, the propagation paths of the externally forced freshwater anomaly can be revealed by the dye-based freshwater fraction anomaly ( \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Black lines mark the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) section. Although substantial dye (externally forced freshwater anomaly) is retained in the upper Nordic Sea by the local gyre recirculation, some moves out of the southern Nordic Sea and reaches the western boundary of the OSNAP East subsection through the Denmark Strait (Figs.  3 d,  6 ,  7 , Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The upper ocean dye propagates along the western boundary of the Irminger and Labrador seas with partial sinking/mixing into the deeper ocean, and is partially mixed into the interior ocean including the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection region (Figs.  6 ,  7 , Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Some surface dye also gets into the relatively deeper layer in the eastern Nordic Sea through surface dense water formation there, recirculates in the Nordic Sea, and moves out of the Nordic Sea with the Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland overflows. The descending Nordic Sea overflows carry the dye at the relatively deeper layer of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge directly into the deep subpolar North Atlantic along the overflow pathways (Supplementary Fig.  6 ), and the dye gradually spreads into the interior deep North Atlantic (Fig.  6 ).

Their difference indicates that the enhanced freshening along the NAC pathway is not due to the direct advection/diffusion of the externally forced freshwater anomaly, but is induced indirectly through the AMOC weakening and associated reduced ocean salt transport/eastward shift of the NAC pathway as found in previous studies 40 , 45 – 47 . Another difference between the salt-based and the dye-based FWF anomalies is along the Iceland-Scotland overflow pathway (Fig.  7k–o ), which will be discussed later in the context of the freshening and slowdown of the Iceland-Scotland overflow. The freshening along the NAC pathway in the upper North Atlantic becomes stable after about 30 years (Fig.  6a–e ). However, the deep North Atlantic keeps freshening for up to about 50 years (Fig.  7a–e ). This is consistent with the longer timescale of the AMOC decline in the relatively dense deep ocean (Fig.  1a ). The role of ISOW in the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection A surprising response to the external freshwater forcing is the strengthening of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection, which is related to the reduction of the vertical stratification in the central Labrador Sea as reflected in the increase of the difference in density anomalies between the surface and the deep central Labrador Sea after 40 years (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). The vertical density difference anomaly and the MLD anomaly in the central Labrador Sea exhibit very similar time evolution (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). A stronger density reduction in the deep central Labrador Sea than that in the layer above makes the central Labrador Sea less stratified and more prone to deep convection in the last 40 years (Supplementary Fig.  8 ; Fig.  3f ). This deep density reduction is primarily attributed to the pronounced freshening in the NEADW layer (Fig.  3d ; Supplementary Fig.  7a ), a layer of water that originates from the Iceland-Scotland overflow and has the maximum climatological mean state salinity (Fig.  3a ). The freshening in the NEADW layer in the deep central Labrador Sea is stronger than that in the upper central Labrador Sea (Fig.  3d , Supplementary Fig.  7a ). As an indicator of the direct propagation of the freshwater anomaly, the dye-based FWF anomaly ( \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The impacts of changes in the ocean circulation on the climatological FWF and the advection/diffusion of the indirectly induced FWF anomaly also play a crucial role on the deep Labrador Sea freshening below 2000m (Supplementary Fig.  7c ). This inference is also supported by the difference between the salt-based and the dye-based FWF anomalies along the Iceland-Scotland overflow pathway on the eastern flanks of the Reykjanes Ridge, where the salt-based FWF anomaly  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

To investigate changes along the Iceland-Scotland overflow pathway, we analyze a meridional section south of Iceland across the Iceland-Scotland overflow, where the climatological mean state zonal overflow in the bottom layer is westward (Fig.  8d ). Along the Iceland-Scotland overflow pathway, there is a reduction in salinity (Fig.  8e ), temperature (Fig.  8f ), and density (Fig.  8g ), and a weakening of the westward Iceland-Scotland overflow velocity (Fig.  8h ).

The meridional section is the same as used in Fig.  8 . The stronger freshening along the Iceland-Scotland Overflow pathway is partially induced by the weakening of the Iceland-Scotland Overflow. The last 40-year average is used. As discussed earlier, the AMOC weakening induces the freshening in the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic along the NAC pathway (Fig.  6k–o ), which is entrained into the Iceland-Scotland overflow and contributes to the freshening of the ISOW (Fig.  7k–o ). This downward propagation/entrainment process of the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic salinity anomaly into the ISOW is also supported by recent observations 34 . Beyond the impact from the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic, the weakening of the Iceland-Scotland overflow also contributes to the freshening of the ISOW. The Iceland-Scotland overflow across the ISOW section (shown in Fig.  8 ) has a mean state volume transport (defined as the integrated volume transport over  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

As the climatological mean state-modified ISOW is characteristically salty, the weakening of the Iceland-Scotland overflow reduces the salt transport to its downstream, contributing to the freshening along the downstream ISOW pathways (Fig.  7a–e ). The freshening along the ISOW pathway reduces the density contrast across the ISOW section, which decreases the strength of the Iceland-Scotland overflow. This coupled positive feedback amplifies the freshening along the downstream ISOW pathway. The climatological mean state ISOW is modified along its pathway by mixing with the warm and saline water in the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic and becomes saltier than the original ISOW across the Iceland-Scotland Ridge 33 . As the modified ISOW flows southward along the eastern flanks of the Reykjanes Ridge into the western North Atlantic and reaches the deep Labrador Sea 33  along interior pathways 20 , 31 , 32 , it forms the Labrador Sea NEADW layer. Therefore, the freshening of the ISOW contributes to the freshening of the NEADW layer in the Labrador Sea. Moreover, because the climatological mean state modified ISOW is saltier than the water mass in the Labrador Sea, the weakening of the modified ISOW inflow strength also freshens the NEADW layer in the Labrador Sea. Combined with the direct downward mixing of the externally forced freshwater anomaly from the upper Labrador Sea, the NEADW layer becomes the most freshened layer in the central Labrador Sea (Fig.  3d ). In summary, the freshening in the NEADW layer in the deep Labrador Sea can be attributed to three primary sources: (1) the direct ocean advection/diffusion of the externally forced freshwater anomaly from the Nordic Sea into the deep Labrador Sea, (2) a decreased transport of the climatological mean state salty water into the deep Labrador Sea due to the weakened Iceland-Scotland overflow strength, and (3) the downward advection/diffusion of the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic freshening (indirectly induced by the AMOC weakening) along the Iceland-Scotland overflow pathway, contributing to the freshening of the ISOW and the associated NEADW in the Labrador Sea. As the density reduction in the upper central Labrador Sea is less than that in the deep NEADW layer after 40 years (Fig.  3f ), the central Labrador Sea becomes less vertically stratified. As a result, the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection is strengthened after 40 years (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). In contrast to the central Labrador Sea, the March MLD is reduced over the northern boundary of the Labrador and Irminger Seas and the southeastern boundary of the Nordic Sea (Fig.  1e ). The climatological winter convection is often much shallower (Fig.  1d ) in these regions mainly over continental slopes. The upper ocean density decline induced by the freshening along the upper ocean boundary currents, as seen in both salt-based and dye-based FWF anomalies (Fig.  6 ), dominates the reduction of March MLD over these continental slope regions."
3,discussion,"Discussion Our study shows that the AMOC across the OSNAP section weakens when an external freshwater flux is added over the southern Nordic Sea where there is no open-ocean deep convection, and the AMOC weakening is dominated by that across OSNAP East, not by that across OSNAP West.

This finding contrasts with previous studies where the prescribed external freshwater forcing often covers the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection region directly and the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection shuts down, causing the subsurface warming and the AMOC weakening 4 , 5 . In contrast, here the external freshwater forcing does not cover the Labrador Sea directly, and the AMOC weakening is associated with cooling rather than warming over the subsurface subpolar North Atlantic. The largest AMOC weakening occurs at the relatively dense level, mainly due to the weakening of the horizontal circulation contribution across sloping isopycnals. Its decline timescale is consistent with the decline timescale of the west–east density contrast in the deep ocean. The AMOC decline is a dynamic process coupling west–east density contrast changes with ocean circulation changes, and it gradually reaches the equilibrium state of the coupled dynamic system. Our study also shows that the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection strengthens due to the reduction of the vertical stratification associated with the freshening/weakening of the Iceland-Scotland overflow. Our study provides a scenario that the change in the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection strength is not a cause of the AMOC change. On the contrary, the AMOC weakening is associated with an opposite change (i.e., strengthening) in the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection through the freshening along the NAC pathway in the eastern subpolar North Atlantic and the downstream Iceland-Scotland overflow pathways. The surface buoyancy loss is not the only factor affecting the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection strength. The density of ISOW and the associated downstream deep NEADW layer could also affect the vertical stratification and, thus, the deep convection strength in the central Labrador Sea. The pronounced freshening in the ISOW and the NEADW layer in the deep Labrador Sea is affected by the freshening in the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic induced by the AMOC weakening. The weakening of the Iceland-Scotland overflow also contributes to the freshening in the ISOW and the NEADW layer in the deep Labrador Sea by reducing the advection of climatological mean state salty water. This deep freshening reduces the deep ocean density and the vertical stratification in the central Labrador Sea, leading to enhanced open-ocean deep convection. This mechanism elucidates why open-ocean deep convection in the Labrador Sea strengthens whereas the AMOC declines. Climate models often lack a good representation of the ISOW-associated NEADW layer in the deep Labrador Sea (Supplementary Fig.  9 ), and have too coarse resolutions to resolve the Labrador Sea boundary currents. A realistic representation of both the ISOW-associated NEADW layer and the narrow boundary current in the Labrador Sea is important to simulate the impact of the ISOW on the Labrador Sea deep convection under the external freshwater forcing. The freshwater anomalies advected by the much broader Labrador Sea boundary current in 1° coarse-resolution models would affect interior Labrador Sea unrealistically and these models are not suitable to study the impact of upstream freshwater anomalies on the downstream Labrador Sea 47 , 49 . In contrast, in 0.25° or higher resolution models, the freshwater anomalies are mainly confined within the substantially better-resolved narrow Labrador Sea boundary current with limited impact on interior Labrador Sea 47 , 49 . The model employed in this study has an improved representation of the ISOW-associated NEADW layer and the narrow boundary current in the Labrador Sea. Hence this model is capable to simulate the influence of the freshening/weakening of the Iceland-Scotland overflow on the strengthening of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection. The 0.25° models are still not able to fully resolve eddies, and higher-resolution models would be needed in future studies to provide a more accurate representation of the eddy mixing process between the boundary and the interior Labrador Sea. The intense Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection that occurred in the early 1990s is indeed accompanied by the freshening in the upper eastern subpolar North Atlantic, the downstream ISOW, and the deep NEADW layer in the central Labrador Sea 33 , 50 , in addition to the excessive surface heat loss. The observed strengthening of the Labrador Sea open-ocean deep convection from the late 1960s to the early 1990s 33 , 50  is also accompanied by the observed weakening/lightening of the ISOW over this period 51 , 52 . The influence of the ISOW density/strength and associated downstream NEADW layer density on the Labradors Sea open-ocean deep convection strength deserves more attention. A realistic representation of the ISOW-associated NEADW layer and the narrow boundary current in the Labrador Sea is necessary for future modeling studies on this topic."

5,introduction,"Introduction The orbital monsoon hypothesis predicts that local summer insolation on precessional time scales drives monsoon circulation, for example by heating the large Asian and South American landmasses 1 . Superimposed on precessional-scale rainfall variations in these regions are anti-phased abrupt monsoon events linked to ice-rafted debris deposition in the North Atlantic Ocean called Heinrich events, and associated with monsoon weakening in Asia 2  and strengthening in South America 3 , as revealed by cave calcite δ 18 O. In the tropics, changing rainfall amounts and oxygen-isotope composition (δ 18 O p ) have been attributed both to changes in local summer insolation that influence atmospheric circulation and to latitudinal shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which favors the warmer hemisphere 4 . Such coherent antiphasing of rainfall characterizes a unified circulation system known as the Global Monsoon 5 , 6 . However, rainfall variations in some major tropical regions, notably in Central America and the Caribbean 7 – 9 , eastern Mexico 10 , and other regions 11 , lack a clear precessional scale forcing, possibly because of their smaller continental area relative to surrounding oceans hampered large-scale land-sea thermal gradients (typical of classic monsoon systems), or because of a stronger ocean control on atmospheric dynamics. Testing for alternative hypotheses on primary drivers of rainfall variations, such as Atlantic Ocean temperature or dynamics 12  requires hydroclimate reconstructions near the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, a key center of action for abrupt climate change 13 . For example, a strong coupling between millennial-scale climate variability recorded in marine sediments of the Cariaco Basin off northern South America and similar events in Greenland ice cores demonstrates a strong coupling between high and low latitude climate in the Atlantic/Caribbean region 14 , 15 . However, variations in the strength of tropical convection over and upwind of Central America may not behave similarly to the Cariaco Basin, particularly as Central America is outside the core oceanic region of the ITCZ and responds to more complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics other than solely north-south ITCZ latitudinal changes. Thus, precisely-dated paleoclimate records from continental locations north of 10 °N would provide key information on the temporal and dynamical response of Central American regional monsoon to Atlantic Ocean forcing. The Atlantic meridional Overturning circulation (AMOC) is one of the core tipping elements of the Earth’s climate system 16  capable of triggering far-reaching, potentially irreversible global changes. Paleoclimate evidence documents rapid transitions between stable circulation modes of AMOC throughout the last glacial cycle 17 : a strong (interglacial) mode in which warm surface waters are transported to the northern high latitudes, release heat to the atmosphere, cool and sink at depths to form deep water masses moving southward (North Atlantic Deep Water formation); and a weak (glacial) circulation mode where northward heat transport is reduced, oceanic convection is shallower, and heat accumulates in the tropics. Tropical hydroclimate reconstructions have shown that changes between AMOC states cause shifts in the latitudinal position of the rain belt and the intensity of monsoon precipitation 18 . Presently, AMOC transports heat from the tropics to the northern hemisphere high latitudes via the Gulf Stream, contributing to a northern mean position of the tropical rainbelt 19 , 20 . Current state-of-the-art climate models project future AMOC weakening in response to greenhouse gas warming 21 , albeit with widespread inter-model discrepancy regarding magnitude and rate of slowdown 22 . For associated impacts, key uncertainties are the role of AMOC on past and future tropical rainfall variability 4 , 23  and the regions most sensitive to future AMOC decline 22 , 24 , 25 . Central America is an ideal location to test for AMOC-tropical climate controls because it is teleconnected to the AMOC upper limb via the northeasterly trade winds, downwind of the large heat reservoirs of the tropical North Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico (the broader Atlantic Warm Pool 7 , 26 ). The rainfall annual cycle responds to interactions between regional SST, ITCZ latitudinal changes, and near-surface wind dynamics, primarily northeasterlies and the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ), linked to east-west excursions of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) 27 – 29 . About ~65% of the 2500 mm of our site’s annual rainfall 30  occurs during the May through November wet season when SSTs exceed 27.5 °C, the Atlantic Warm Pool is at its maximum areal extension 31 , and a weaker CLLJ over the Caribbean contributes to deep convective systems. During winter (December-April), an intensified CLLJ linked to the westward expansion of NASH and lower SST increases atmospheric subsidence over the Caribbean suppressing regional convection 27 . Winter rainfall, which accounts for ca. 35% of the annual total precipitation, consists mostly of localized convection and northerly-sourced ( nortes)  air masses. We refer to the strong seasonality of Central American rainfall as part of the Global ‘monsoon’, while recognizing that the region lacks some of the distinguishing features of classic monsoon circulation such as large-scale wind reversals. Here, we show from a speleothem-based paleo-rainfall record over the last glacial cycle (140,000 years to present) from Guatemala that the Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation (AMOC) and sea surface temperature (SST) drive Central American hydroclimate variations and propose a strong link between AMOC and monsoon strength. This thermally-driven Central American monsoon is distinct from precession-driven monsoon systems elsewhere in the tropics, and highlights the direct forcing of Atlantic Ocean thermal states on Central American regional climate."
6,results,"Results and Discussion Glacial-interglacial monsoon convective states We reconstruct Central American hydroclimate from calcite δ 18 O time series of precisely dated speleothems from three Maya highland caves at ~15°N latitude on the Caribbean slope of Guatemala (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), Grutas del Rey Marcos (RM) 12 , Cueva Jul Iq (JQ), and Cueva Bombil Pek (BO). Our reconstruction is anchored by ninety-three  230 Th radiometric ages on nine replicating stalagmites to produce a composite time series, which was adjusted for inter-cave differences (related to the elevation difference between caves sites) and for the ice-volume corrected seawater isotopic composition (δ 18 O ivc , in ‰ Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite, VPDB throughout) 32  (Supplementary Fig.  2 ; Methods). We interpret δ 18 O ivc  as primarily a proxy for δ 18 O of precipitation (δ 18 O p ) reaching the cave site, which in turn is controlled by rainfall amount along the prevailing source-to-cave moisture trajectory 33 . At our cave sites, lower monthly δ 18 O p  values are associated with enhanced rainfall from deep convection during May-November ( r  = −0.68,  p  < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig.  3, 4 ). Although seasonal changes of the ITCZ latitudinal position modulate regional moisture convergence across tropical America, today the ITCZ does not reach the latitude of our cave sites (15 °N) during boreal summer 7 . Rather, a broad zone of convection persists over Central America north of the oceanic ITCZ. We thus discuss δ 18 O variations in our record in terms of regional convective intensity to distinguish it from proxy records from lower latitudes, such as the Cariaco Basin 15  (10 °N), that are more directly affected by north-south ITCZ changes. Cave drip waters integrate amount-weighted precipitation δ 18 O values, thus lower δ 18 O indicates more regional convection and a stronger monsoon and higher δ 18 O reflecting less convection (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Our study sites are particularly sensitive to tropical North Atlantic processes (Supplementary Fig.  6 ) because ~75% of the annual precipitation originates in the Caribbean/western tropical Atlantic region 34 , with smaller contributions from northern extra-tropical cold-fronts (~15%) and eastern tropical Pacific (~10%). Central American paleoclimate is defined by a distinct bi-modal glacial-interglacial topology over the last 140,000 years (Fig.  1 ), suggesting the existence of two primary convective regimes: a weak glacial monsoon and a strong interglacial monsoon, either of which may be interrupted by even more extreme abrupt episodes of monsoon weakening. The prolonged strong monsoon between MIS 5e and the first half of MIS 4 lasted more than 60,000 years and was punctuated by several millennial-scale weak monsoon events.

Following ice age terminations I and II (T1 and T2 in Fig.  2 ), peak monsoon strength was delayed for several thousand years behind minimum global ice volume, peaking at ca. 125,500 yr BP and 9000 yr BP, respectively, and in both cases relatively stable and wet conditions were maintained for several millennia. A large and abrupt transition to a glacial weak monsoon state occurred between 66,000 and 60,000 yr BP, contemporaneously to intensified iceberg discharges in the North Atlantic 35 , 36  and to an abrupt AMOC slowdown 17  (Fig.  2 ).

Glacial termination I (T1) and II (T2) are also highlighted. Vertical grey bars denote Heinrich stadials (HS0-11). Marine Isotope Stages (MIS 1-6) are also shown. Our observations reveal that convective intensity was decoupled from orbital precession during the last glacial/interglacial cycle (Fig.  1a, b ): wet intervals lasted longer than a precessional cycle and spanned insolation lows, whereas dry intervals were commonly shorter than a full precessional cycle. Thus, a strong glacial-interglacial cycle distinguishes Central America from monsoons in Asia 2 , South America 37 , and Borneo 38  that are more clearly paced by precession and local summer insolation (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). AMOC and SST forcing Comparisons with North Atlantic paleoceanographic reconstructions 17 , 36 , 39  show that Central American monsoon intensity is primarily responding to tropical and subtropical North Atlantic SST and AMOC strength, with superimposed millennial-scale monsoon collapses during cold North Atlantic Heinrich stadials (Fig.  2 ). For example, SST records from the Iberian Margin 36  and the Guiana Basin 39  off northern South America show a thermal structure similar to our rainfall record, with a prolonged last interglacial period punctuated by millennial scale cooling and drying excursions. The peak warming off Iberia at 127,100 yr BP (Fig.  2e ) closely overlaps the resumption of strong convection over Central America but is delayed behind the ca. 130,000 yr BP global ice volume minimum. Three major weak monsoon intervals (high δ 18 O ivc ) coincided with Arctic water penetration to the subtropics during MIS 5 as inferred from high C 37:4  alkenone ratios in marine sediments, at 111,500 to 107,500 yr BP (MIS 5 d), 105,600 to 103,600 yr BP (MIS 5c), and 89,000 to 85,000 yr BP (MIS 5b) (Fig.  2a ). These monsoon collapses coincide with a period of moderate to low global ice volume (Fig.  2g ), suggesting that during relatively warm conditions, Central American rainfall lies close to a tipping point in which slight cooling may produce extensive monsoon suppression. Further, we show that millennial-scale weak monsoon periods over the last glacial/interglacial cycle were synchronous within dating uncertainties to cooling episodes in the northern high- and mid-latitudes 36 , 40  related to ice-rafted debris (IRD) deposition and meltwater routing to the North Atlantic Ocean, called Heinrich (H) events or stadials (HS) 35 , 41 . For instance, the weakest monsoon convection in Central America just prior to Terminations II and I are coeval to the largest North Atlantic HS11 and HS1, while the abrupt dry phases at the MIS 5b and MIS 5 d coincide with HS8 and HS10 (Ref.  42 ; Fig.  2 ). Less severe monsoon weakenings are also recorded in the Guatemalan stalagmites throughout both warm MIS 5 and cold stages MIS 4-2. Although our monsoon reconstruction shares Heinrich dry events with the Cariaco Basin, our data lack the distinct millennial-scale Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) variability evident in the Greenland ice core δ 18 O 43  and Cariaco Basin records 15 . These differences, along with the stronger correspondence between our record and Atlantic SST, suggest that Central American monsoon strength is responding to different forcings than those inferred from the marine sediments in the Cariaco Basin and has a unique paleoclimatic history separate from the southern Caribbean 15 , 44 . Remarkably, the Central American monsoon responded on a one-to-one basis (Fig.  3 ) with AMOC over the last deglaciation, as detailed in the  231 Pa/ 230 Th ratios in Bermuda rise ocean sediments 17 , 45  in the subtropical North Atlantic. Our record indicates moderate monsoon strength at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 20,000 to 18,000 yr BP in our record), a monsoon collapse at 17,500 to 14,800 yr BP (HS1), a return to wetter conditions during the Bølling-Allerød (B-A, 14,800 to 12,800 yr BP), another monsoon weakening during the Younger Dryas (YD, 12,800 to 11,600 yr BP), and a gradual monsoon strengthening in the Early Holocene to reach near-modern values by 9000 yr BP 12 . Each of these weak monsoon periods was associated with cooling and AMOC slowdowns, and vice versa for strong monsoon intervals. The moderate monsoon during the LGM is linked to similarly moderate AMOC strength comparable to that during the B-A, and provides evidence for an active – though weaker than modern – monsoon during the Last Glacial Maximum in Guatemala. Reconciling this observation with proxy data indicating a strong LGM monsoon elsewhere in the neotropics is an important target for future work 7 , 46 .

Model constraints on AMOC-monsoon link We use iTRACE 47  data – an ensemble of transient isotope-enabled simulations based on the CESM v1.3 and spanning 20,000 to 11,000 yr BP - to demonstrate that during the last deglaciation the strength of the Central American monsoon can be explained by synchronous changes in simulated δ 18 O p , convective intensity, and AMOC strength (Fig.  4 ). For instance, the iTRACE full forcing experiment (including ice sheet, greenhouse gas, orbital, and meltwater forcing) shows that an increase in speleothem δ 18 O ivc  coincides with decreases in AMOC strength, North Atlantic surface temperature, and regional convective rainfall and a convective activity index in Central America and Caribbean (see Methods for details). Simulated δ 18 O p  values increase during HS1 and the YD, almost perfectly matching the speleothem δ 18 O ivc  and weak convective intervals (Figs.  4b and d ). Fig. 4 Guatemala δ 18 O ivc  versus iTRACE model output. The Guatemala reconstruction is shown in blue, and iTRACE 47  output ( a-e ) for Central American and the Caribbean (latitudes 10.42° to 21.78° and longitudes 265° to 300°) as 31-yr running averages.  a  iTRACE simulated surface temperature.  b  iTRACE δ 18 O p  for MJJASON (orange) and DJFMA (black).  c  Rainfall amount for MJJASON (pink) and DJFMA (black).  d  Convective activity index for MJJASON.  e  Simulated AMOC from the equator to 49.6°N from the 500 to 1200 m depth. The iTRACE model accurately simulates the δ 18 O p  response to changing regional rainfall amount in Central America and the Caribbean, which is explained by changes in surface temperature related to AMOC strength. Vertical bars define Younger Dryas (YD), Bølling-Allerød (B-A), Heinrich 1 (HS1), and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The iTRACE simulation shows that during HS1 rainfall was suppressed from Central America east to the Caribbean Sea, coupled with a general weakening of convective activity over the North Atlantic (Figs.  5b and d ). The rainfall reduction is clearly linked to Caribbean SST cooling of ~5 °C associated with meltwater influx to the North Atlantic and a pronounced slowdown of the AMOC. The strongest iTRACE precipitation response is seen in the May through November wet season, while weaker for winter (DJFMA) rainfall (Fig.  4c ). The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean was not an important moisture source, in agreement with modern moisture back-trajectory analyses (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). SST cooling within the tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean coincides with near-surface wind intensification describing a southward shift of moisture convergence and convection strengthening over South America (Fig.  5a, b ). Similar but less pronounced responses are seen for the YD minus Early Holocene (not shown). Fig. 5 iTRACE simulations for Heinrich Stadial 1 (15,200–16,800 yr BP) minus the Early Holocene (11,001–11,500 yr BP) show Caribbean/Tropical Atlantic SST cooling and wet season rainfall reductions related to AMOC weakening. a  May-November difference in surface temperature (colors) and near-surface winds (arrows).  b  Difference in wet season Central American rainfall (shading as percentage changes relative to the Heinrich Stadial 1 climatology) was associated with a weakened atmospheric convective activity.  c - d  Same as  a  and  b  but for the dry (December to April) season.

Maps are plotted with the M_map package 92  for MATLAB software, using the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG) 93  for coastlines. Comparing the iTRACE transient simulations with and without meltwater forcing allows isolation of the AMOC forcing (Fig.  6 ) on Central American rainfall. We find significant decoupling between simulated δ 18 O p  and precipitation in the experiment without meltwater forcing (Fig.  6b, c ). Furthermore, the stalagmite δ 18 O and iTRACE no meltwater results (black in Fig.  6 ) are strongly different, demonstrating that the variability observed in speleothem δ 18 O data is best explained by the AMOC slowdown associated with meltwater forcing in the North Atlantic.

The remarkable difference between our speleothem δ 18 O ivc  and the NO MELT experiment results pinpoints the dominant role of AMOC in driving Central American monsoon intensity during the last deglaciation. Vertical bars define Younger Dryas (YD), Bølling-Allerød (B-A), Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Atlantic mean state control on rainfall Given the temporal dissimilarity between Central America and other tropical monsoon regions more strongly paced by orbital precession (Supplementary Fig.  7 ), we posit that the Central American monsoon represents a thermally-controlled monsoon, distinct from the Global Monsoon. Central America may be distinguished from other monsoon regions because of its physiography of a small and narrow isthmus bounded by a major ocean heat reservoir whose energy budget drives regional convection 31 . We propose that AMOC intensity, tropical Atlantic SST, and northern hemisphere ice sheet extent were the dominant rainfall controls over Central America during the last 140,000 years BP, enhanced by Central America’s proximity to the AMOC center of action. For instance, the positive δ 18 O ivc  excursions between late MIS 4 and MIS 2 (~65,000–17,000 yr BP) occurred coevally with Laurentide Ice sheet expansion and AMOC shifting to a weak glacial circulation mode 13 , 17 , which suppressed Caribbean and Central American atmospheric convection. Furthermore, the lack of clear DO events in our record suggests that Central American paleoclimate differs from that inferred from the Cariaco Basin and the two regions should be viewed as distinct climate regions. Hydroclimate observations in the Caribbean and Central American regions can be now understood as a predominantly thermodynamic response to changing Atlantic Ocean thermal states, and our study thus reconciles previous regional hydroclimate interpretations from the Bahamas 48 , Cuba 9 , 49 , Puerto Rico 50 , Costa Rica 8 , Mexico 10 , 46 , 51 , and Guatemala 7  (Supplementary Fig.  8 ), which can now be considered a unified regional Central American and Caribbean monsoon system driven primarily by Atlantic Ocean processes. A bimodal speleothem δ 18 O ivc  distribution (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) supports the existence of two main monsoon states, and further implicates the existence of an SST threshold below which widespread atmospheric convection is diminished, possibly related to an SST threshold of ~27 °C that sustains vigorous convection today 12 , 52 , 53 . Considered in relation to the background climate boundary conditions, temperature thresholds within the tropical North Atlantic basin might have been lower than modern during intervals of larger/intermediate Northern Hemisphere ice sheets 54  and could potentially increase under future greenhouse warming 53 , 55 . The Central American paleoclimatic record and data-model comparison have implications for future projections of AMOC, Tropical North Atlantic/Caribbean SST, and monsoon changes. The analysis of different model simulations during the last deglaciation isolates AMOC as a dominant forcing mechanism of regional monsoon convection. Further, Tropical North Atlantic/Caribbean SST was tied to AMOC strength variations throughout the last glacial cycle, triggering rapid transitions in the Central American monsoon convection. Observational and proxy data suggest that AMOC has weakened over the last century 56 – 58  in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, while other studies argue that the observed AMOC slowdown results from its internal variability 24 , 59 . Under various future warming scenarios, AMOC is very likely to weaken by the end of the century 60 , although large uncertainties among models hamper our ability to confidently estimate the temporal rates of decline 22 , 25 . Such a discrepancy has been attributed to the over-stability of AMOC in model simulations 61  and the lack of dynamical cryosphere (i.e., ice melting) and deepwater formation processes 25 . Early-warning signals of AMOC approaching a tipping point are also found in most recent climate models 62 , 63 . The speleothem data indicate that AMOC weakening alone can trigger widespread reduction of monsoon convection in Central America and the Caribbean, independently of the background thermal conditions. Future rainfall in Central America and the Caribbean is projected to decrease significantly by the end of the century 64 – 66 , but few studies have focused on the role of AMOC 22 , 67 , 68 . Whether monsoon regimes weaken in the future will also depend on the direct response to SST warming 69 . However, separating the competing effects of direct radiative, SST warming, and dynamic forcing on future monsoon variations remains challenging 70 – 74 . In this context, our results stress that if the AMOC- Central American monsoon link documented over the last 140,000 yr BP holds under future warming scenarios, a potential AMOC slowdown or collapse as suggested by climate models 23 , 62 , 64 – 68 , 75  will likely weaken monsoon convection in Central America and impact freshwater availability in the region."

9,introduction,"Introduction The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a key role in the global climate. The near-surface branch of the AMOC (upper limb) transports heat and salt northwards from the Equator, which helps to offset the atmospheric cooling at mid-latitudes (particularly central Europe, Scandinavia), moderating regional climate 1 , 2 . At high-latitudes, colder, fresher, and denser water-masses (lower limb of AMOC) are formed that travel equatorward via deep ocean currents 3 , 4 . A continuous sinking branch of dense waters is thus necessary to maintain the northward flow of warm and buoyant water in the Atlantic Ocean. Paleoclimate records reveal a strong link between the strength and location of dense water formation and abrupt temperature fluctuations around the globe over the last glacial cycle 5 . Additionally, modelling studies suggest that a shut-down of dense water formation could be a potential tipping point in future climate 6 . Given its importance, it is crucial to understand how and where the water of the lower limb of the AMOC is formed. A trans-basin observational array (OSNAP) showed that the lower limb preferably forms north of the OSNAP-East section, which extends from the south-eastern tip of Greenland to Scotland 7 , 8 . The strength of the MOC at the OSNAP-East array between August 2014 and May 2018 was estimated at 16.8  ± 0.6 Sv (1 Sv  ≡ 10 6  m 3  s −1 ) and the density surface that separates the lower and upper limb was 27.55 kg m −3   8 . The source of the lower limb waters and the processes leading to its formation are still debated, however. Hypotheses range from open ocean convection in the Greenland and Iceland Seas to densification of the Atlantic waters at the Arctic shelves and along the eastern periphery of the Nordic Seas 9 , 10 . The annual dense water production rate in the Greenland and Iceland Seas was observed to be  O (1 Sv) 11 – 13 , much lower than total volume flux of the lower limb of the AMOC, which ranges from 15 Sv to 18 Sv 8 , 14 – 16 . Dense waters from the Nordic Seas are transported across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge (GSR) to the eSPNA primarily in the East Greenland Current (EGC) 10 , 17 , with a smaller contribution via the Iceland-Faroe Slope Jet 18 . The transport of dense waters (which also include overflow waters that are known to have potential densities >27.8 kg m −3 ) across the GSR has been estimated to be 6.6 ± 0.4 Sv 19 , and explaining approximately half of the total observed AMOC lower limb 8 , 15 . The other half was found to be associated with oceanic heat loss in the Irminger Sea and Iceland basin 19 . However, the role of interior mixing in forming the AMOC lower limb is still unclear and could be large, given observational and modelling evidence for vigorous mixing in the Denmark Strait 20 , 21 . A recent study reported that air-sea flux cannot fully explain the time-mean AMOC magnitude at OSNAP-East and a residual mixing is necessary to explain the gap 22 . Additionally, it is not well known how much of the total AMOC strength could be attributed to Atlantic and Arctic waters. It is important to note that the Atlantic and Arctic water denote water parcels that are arriving from the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean after upstream property modification. To answer these questions, we calculated and diagnosed Lagrangian trajectories for the present-day climate using data from a high-resolution (1/12°) ocean sea-ice hindcast 23  and employed an Eulerian surface water-mass transformation framework 24 – 26  to 1) Evaluate the contributions of Atlantic inflows and Arctic outflows to the AMOC lower limb; 2) Identify and quantify the role of air-sea fluxes and interior mixing in transforming the Atlantic and Arctic waters."
10,results,"Results Pathways and along-path water mass properties The total southward volume transport across Fram Strait (Fig.  1 a, red line) is 8.6 Sv (Table  1 ). This estimate matches well with previous observational and modelling studies 27 , 28 . A majority of the southward transport, i.e., 5.6 Sv (65%, Table  1 ), reaches the eastern SPNA section (Fig.  1 a, blue line). The northward volume transport across the eastern SPNA section (Fig.  1 b, blue line) is 65.4 Sv in the present study (Table  1 ), out of which 58.8 Sv (90%) returned to the starting section. These quantitative results compare remarkably well with a recent study 16 . The amount of volume transport reaching the Barents Sea (Fig.  1 a, orange line); the sea surface (evaporating); and Fram Strait from these two sets of Lagrangian experiments is provided in Table  1 .

The East Greenland Current pathway and the recirculation of Fram Strait waters can be seen in the Arctic outflow spreading, while the eastern subpolar gyre circulation is evident for the Atlantic waters. In the present work, southward transports are seeded across Fram Strait (red line) and northward volume transports are initiated along the eastern Subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (SPNA) section (blue line). The ending sections of the trajectories are indicated by red, blue and orange lines.

The spread of Arctic waters in the Nordic Seas and eastern SPNA (Fig.  2 a) is associated with a diverse set of pathways: East Greenland Current (EGC) 29 ; Jan Mayen Current (JMC) 30 ; Greenland Sea gyre 31 ; East Icelandic Current (EIC) 32 ; shelf break EGC 33 ; separated EGC 34 . The Arctic waters along the Jan Mayen Ridge (JMR) and EIC flows together in Iceland-Faroe Slope Jet (IFSJ) 18  and pass through the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) and Faroe Bank Channel (FBC) to reach the eastern SPNA section (Fig.  2 a). The Norwegian Atlantic Front Current (NwAFC) and Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current (NwASC) 35 , 36  are noted to be transporting the Arctic waters back towards the Fram Strait. The Atlantic inflow primarily moves with the eastern subpolar gyre circulation (Fig.  2 b). Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current and North Icelandic Irminger Current (NIIC) are found to be responsible in transporting Atlantic waters into the Nordic Seas (Fig.  2 b).

The watermass properties of the Arctic outflow (for Atlantic inflow, see Supplementary Fig.  1 ) reveal that along the east Greenland coast Arctic waters are low in temperature, fresh, and less dense (Fig.  2 c–e), indicating the control of salinity on the density field. However, as the Arctic waters reach the eastern part of the Nordic Seas and the eastern SPNA, they get characterized by deeper, warmer, saltier, and denser watermass properties than found in Fram Strait, associated with a larger mixed layer depth (Fig.  2 c–g). Waters exiting Fram Strait are generally colder, fresher and thus must gain heat and salt to become so much warmer and saltier water masses. The larger depth associated with these locations (Fig.  2 f) indicates that the gain of heat and salt is due to mixing with deeper, warmer, and saltier non-arctic watermass, carried into the region by the North Atlantic Current (NAC), the Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current and the Norwegian Atlantic Front Current. The age of Arctic water masses increases as they move away from the starting section i.e. Fram Strait (Fig.  2 h). Note that the shelf break EGC takes less than 1000 days to reach the eastern SPNA section, while the travel time is much longer for the separated EGC (Fig.  2 h). This disparity of timescales associated with the two branches is related to the depth of the flow (Fig.  2 f, deeper depths correspond to slower circulation). Interaction between the Arctic outflow and the Atlantic inflow To focus on dense waters that are leaving the eastern SPNA as the AMOC lower limb, the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) has been computed with trajectories that had reached the eastern SPNA section (Fig.  3 ). It is clearly evident that the majority of Atlantic waters enter the eastern SPNA as warmer, saltier and lighter water masses (Fig.  3 a–c, orange contours). After entering, these waters first undergo gradual densification (Fig.  3 c) due to the atmospheric cooling (Fig.  3 a), while freshening as a result of the net freshwater input (Fig.  3 b). The modified waters subsequently sink to greater depths, with a fraction recirculating southward. The remaining portion of the densified water continues northward until it comes in contact with the relative colder and fresher Arctic outflow present in Denmark Strait (between  ≈ 65 °N to 68 °N). Around Denmark Strait, the Atlantic inflow is losing heat and salt, and further increasing density, while Arctic outflow is subject to opposite tendencies (Fig.  3 a–c). So, the sub-surface mixing of Atlantic waters is necessary for the AMOC lower limb to achieve its density and depth. At low temperatures, the density of these Arctic waters is primarily determined by salinity (Fig.  3 c, blue dashed contours). On encountering relatively warmer and saltier Atlantic waters between  ≈ 60 °N to 63 °N, Arctic waters continue to gain heat and salt (Fig.  3 a–c). These latitudes coinide with those of the Faroe Bank channel and FSC. Fig. 3 Lagrangian meridional overturning stream function. a  Meridional overturning stream function in a) temperature-latitude,  b  salinity-latitude, and  c  density-latitude coordinate system. This has been computed using equation ( 3 ) and with trajectories that have exited the eastern Subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (SPNA) section southward. The orange lines indicate Atlantic inflows and blue dashed lines correspond to Arctic waters that have reached the eastern SPNA. The direction of the water movement in each figure is indicated by arrows. The solid streamlines are 2 Sv apart and start at 1 Sv. Similarly, the dashed streamlines are plotted with 1 Sv interval and start at -1 Sv. The Atlantic and Arctic water contribution to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) lower limb are shown with bold orange and blue numbers respectively. The changing properties of the two water masses with an opposite sign along the Faroe Bank channel, FSC and the Denmark strait confirms the exchange of heat and salt between them. Finally, after mixing, the Atlantic and Arctic water masses exit the eastern SPNA with similar temperature, salinity, and density as the lower limb of the AMOC (Fig.  3 a–c). Further analysis of the overturning stream function in the density-latitude coordinate (Fig.  3 c, orange contours) reveals that the maximum of the overturning stream function at the eastern SPNA section (southernmost latitude of Fig.  3 c) is 10.1 Sv on the 27.57 kg m −3  isopycnal for the North Atlantic inflow. This means that 10.1 Sv of Atlantic waters has transformed from lower densities (<27.57 kg m −3  isopycnal) to densities higher than 27.57 kg m −3  (lower limb of the AMOC). The low-to-high density watermass transformation of the Atlantic waters is a combined effect of air-sea fluxes and interior mixing with Arctic waters. A small overturning cell is also present in density space with an amplitude of 0.7 Sv in which Atlantic waters with densities higher than 27.89 kg m −3  overturn, becoming waters with densities between 27.89 kg m −3  and 27.57 kg m −3  (Fig.  3 c, anticlockwise rotating cell) due to mixing. In summary, the total transformation rate of Atlantic waters into the lower limb of AMOC is 10.8 Sv on the 27.57 kg m −3  isopycnal. The amount of Arctic water that reaches the eastern SPNA transect with densities >27.57 kg m −3  and contributes to the lower branch of the AMOC is 4.3 Sv. Thus, the total time-mean AMOC in the eSPNA is 15.1 Sv. These numbers are in agreement with previous observational evidence 8 , 14 , 15 . The density-latitude MOC obtained from tracing the Atlantic waters does not involve a dominant watermass transformation from low-to-high density along the eastern periphery of the Nordic Seas (i.e. north of 70 °N in Fig.  3 c) and this branch is therefore considered to be a minor component of the time-mean AMOC. The meridional overturning stream function in density-latitude coordinates (Fig.  3 c) shows that the AMOC lower limb formation is mostly located between  ≈ 60 °N and 70 °N, and that Arctic waters contribute to the AMOC lower limb through changes in temperature, salinity, and density from Denmark Strait onwards, where they encounter Atlantic inflows. Interior mixing is found to be the dominant process in transforming Arctic waters that join the AMOC lower limb, while Atlantic waters are transformed through a combination of air-sea fluxes and interior mixing. The Eulerian surface watermass transformation framework (calculated using equation ( 10 ) and between  ≈ 60 °N and 70 °N) revealed that 7.2 Sv of Atlantic waters (52% of total AMOC and 67% of Atlantic waters overturning) are transformed to lower limb (densities >27.57 kg m −3 ), due to air-sea interactions. This implies the remaining 3.6 Sv ( ≈ 33%) of Atlantic waters must have been transformed through interior mixing with Arctic waters. The Lagrangian heat and salt divergences in Fig.  4  and in Supplementary Fig.  2 ,  3  confirm the heat and salt exchanges between the Arctic waters (gaining) and Atlantic waters (losing) between  ≈ 60 °N and 70 °N. It also affirms that the Arctic water transformation is only due to the interior mixing as it gains heat and salt primarily below the mixed layer depth (MLD) (Fig.  4 , top panel and Supplementary Fig.  2 ) where Atlantic inflows lose heat and salt (Fig.  4 , bottom panel and Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Here (Fig.  4 , bottom panel and Supplementary Fig.  3 ) also one can see that closer to the surface (within the MLD) the Atlantic inflows are not significantly losing heat and salt along the eastern periphery of Nordic Seas (i.e. north of 70 °N). It is worth noting that Atlantic waters are also losing heat below the MLD downstream of Denmark Strait (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). However, the Arctic waters are not gaining heat at these locations (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). This indicates that the heat loss of Atlantic waters at these locations is occurring just below the base of the MLD and is due to the air-sea fluxes. For an example, let us consider a winter-time trajectory within the MLD enters a grid box through its western grid wall, moves just below the MLD, and exits through the eastern wall. The trajectory will thus experience the wintertime cooling before it leaves the grid box. When calculating the heat divergence at the exit wall (or in other words below the MLD), a cooling of the parcel will be observed. Thus, although the total heat divergence obtained from the Atlantic inflows is mostly determined by the below MLD heat divergence (Fig.  4 , bottom panel), it should be considered as a result of mixing if the Arctic waters are gaining heat at the same locations. Fig. 4 The Lagrangian heat and salt divergence. Zonally integrated Lagrangian heat (GW m −1 ; using equation ( 5 )) and salt (kg s −1  m −1 ; derived from equation ( 7 )) divergence of the Arctic outflows ( a ,  b ) and Atlantic inflows ( c ,  d ) that have exited the eastern Subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (SPNA) southward. The blue, black, and red line corresponds to total divergence, divergence below the mixed layer depth (MLD), and divergence within the MLD respectively. The magenta line shows the northern latitudinal limit ( ≈ 70 °N) within which we have employed the Eulerian surface watermass transformation framework. The cyan color indicates no divergence in heat and salt. Dependency on chosen time period The Atlantic and Arctic Ocean contributions to the AMOC lower limb can depend on the chosen time period, as individual Lagrangian water parcels are expected to reach the eastern SPNA section at different times due to the unique ocean currents, hence air-sea fluxes and mixing. Consider two water parcels moving northward from the eSPNA section with contrasting flows. One parcel moves with strong near-surface ocean currents and avoids surface densification during winter, to subsequently exit the eastern SPNA section southward. In contrast, the other parcel moves slowly and is surface-densified during winter before leaving the eSPNA. In the former case, the water parcel will not contribute to the AMOC lower limb as it cannot acquire sufficiently high density, while the latter water parcel is fully transformed to the density of AMOC lower limb water. As the seasonal cycle also varies from year to year, we anticipate changing Atlantic and Arctic contributions to the AMOC lower limb, depending on the time period under consideration. We can further examine whether forward and backward tracking of ocean water parcels provides similar results. To address the time dependency of our key findings, we therefore back-track waters flowing southward across the eSPNA section in 2021, for comparison with forward tracking from 1979. For the backward tracking experiment, we obtain a counterpart meridional overturning stream function in property-latitude coordinates along with contributions of Atlantic and Arctic waters to the AMOC lower limb (Supplementary Fig.  4 ) that closely resemble those obtained for the forward tracking experiment (Fig.  3 ). This strengthens our conclusions and demonstrates the robustness of the results. A detailed inspection of the 2021 back-tracking experiment revals the waters from the subtropical areas are warmer and lighter (Supplementary Fig.  4a ,  c ) than in the 1979 forward-tracking experiment. This may be associated with the time that water parcels spend in the eastern SPNA. In the forward tracking experiment, more than 90% of northward-moving waters across the eSPNA took around 5 years to exit southward (i.e. by 1979 + 5 = 1984, Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The timescale for the majority of backward-tracked parcels to arrive at the eSPNA section is also around 5 years, but that will be by 2016 (2021-5). We conclude that warmer water prevails around the eSPNA section later in the hindcast. Small differences in the stream functions obtained from forward and backward tracking may be more generally explained by variability of air-sea fluxes and interior mixing throughout the hindcast. However, only the Atlantic contribution to the AMOC lower limb is notably different between forward and backward tracing experiments, the Arctic contribution being steady. Backward tracing reveals that the Atlantic and Arctic contribution to the AMOC lower limb have uncertainty of 3% as compared to the forward trajectory simulation. This difference is attributed to the exposure of Atlantic waters to variable air-sea interaction, while the Arctic waters are only subject to steadier interior mixing. Backward tracking of southward flows across the eSPNA is furthermore insufficient to fully quantify combined transport from the Fram Strait and eSPNA sections (and respective partitioning), compared to the forward trajectories. Based on our explanation, it is important to note that the estimate of 67% of Atlantic waters overturning due to air-sea fluxes and 33% related to interior mixing is accurate to within a few percent, clearly highlighting the relative importance of air-sea interactions and mixing processes. The noted differences in the stream functions obtained from forward and backward Lagrangian tracking might also be associated with the inability to start trajectories from their exact ending position after a forward/backward tracking simulation using time-evolving fields. This is since we are limited by data unavailability at interpolated time steps in the model/reanalysis. Consider for example a trajectory that starts at the Fram Strait in January 1979 (using monthly data from the hindcast model) and reaches the eSPNA section after 11.3 years. Although we know the ending position of that trajectory, we cannot start a backward run from the same location, as the hindcast model (or any model/reanalysis) does not provide data at an interpolated time step (in the above example, we would need data on day 18.25 of March 1990). The choice of 43 years for trajectory simulations was done to ensure that most trajectories (or volume transport) have had time to exit the study domain (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). When it comes to the small difference of the stream functions in Fig.  3  and Supplementary Fig.  4  due to mismatch in forward and backward trajectory pathways, it is important to note that the trajectories will not disperse evenly in space but be concentrated where the strong currents are located e.g., the East Greenland Current, Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current, etc (Fig.  2 a, b) The similar shape of stream functions obtained from the forward and backward trajectory (Fig.  3  and Supplementary Fig.  4 ) experiments also validate this argument that trajectories mainly follow the strong mean currents."
11,discussion,"Discussion Lagrangian analysis of an ocean model hindcast spanning 1979-2021 reveals that the AMOC lower limb consists of 72% Atlantic waters and 28% Arctic waters. The warm and salty Atlantic waters initially become dense due to heat loss to the atmosphere sinking to greater depths. A portion of the deep, dense water returns immediately southward and exits the eastern SPNA. The remaining dense water moves northward and encounters cold and fresh Arctic waters in the Denmark Strait and along the Faroe-Shetland and Faroe Bank channels. There, the Atlantic waters further gain density, sink, and return southward to leave the eastern SPNA. We find that 67% of the Atlantic water transformation is contributed by the air-sea fluxes, while 33% of overturning is related to the interior mixing with Arctic waters. We have also shown that low-to-high density water mass transformation of Atlantic waters (that are not entering the Arctic Ocean) along the eastern rim of the Nordic Seas is only a minor component of the AMOC. Previous studies focused on the heat-loss-driven watermass transformation of Atlantic waters around the perimeter of Nordic Seas 15 , 37 , 38  and open ocean convection in the Greenland Sea and Iceland Seas 13  but with little or no emphasis on its role in determining the AMOC strength. We show that neither open-ocean convection in the Greenland and Iceland Seas, mixing between gyre and boundary, nor heat loss of ocean waters along the eastern periphery of Nordic Seas (or in other words along the NwAFC and Norwegian Atlantic Slope Current) which do not enter the Arctic Ocean are sufficient to transform waters to the high densities necessary to sustain the AMOC lower limb. However, ocean heat loss along the Nordic Seas periphery can have an indirect effect on the Arctic outflow. After losing heat to the atmosphere, a substantial fraction of densified Atlantic waters travel further northward and enter the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait ( ≈ 3 Sv) and the Barents Sea ( ≈ 3.3 Sv) as shown in Supplementary Fig.  6 ,  7 . In the Arctic, these Atlantic waters may be further modified through interaction with the atmosphere and Arctic freshwater before being exported southward again through Fram Strait. Such a scenario would be in line with previous findings 10 , 39 . An extension of the present study could thus be to trace Atlantic waters through the Arctic Ocean, on a longer timescale. This will help to identify and quantify the water mass transformation of Atlantic waters in the Arctic, of indirect consequence for the AMOC. Given the importance of interior mixing in sustaining a realistic-strength AMOC in the current hindcast, we note that some HighResMIP (High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project) climate models underestimating AMOC strength are characterised by a shallow lower limb 40 . This highlights the importance of correctly representing both water mass properties (densities), pathways, and transformation processes (surface and interior) in climate models. Global climate model simulations robustly indicate a slowdown of the AMOC in warmer future climate 41 – 43 . These simulated slowdowns are associated with a combination of surface warming and freshening that reduce surface density 42 , increasing upper ocean stratification. We have emphasised here the importance of mixing between Atlantic and Arctic waters, as a substantial component of water mass transformation, necessary to sustain the lower limb and to achieve the density and depth of the return flow. By inhibiting mixing through raised potential energy demand, stronger stratification will reduce the amount of turbulent kinetic energy available for this mixing. Reduced sub-surface mixing of Atlantic waters is thus potentially the key to overall AMOC slowdown, further reducing the depth to which surface overturned Atlantic waters are returned southward. In summary, in a future weakened AMOC, the lower limb will likely shoal to shallower depths, as was apparent during the Last Glacial Maximum 5 . Beyond the direct climate impacts of a weakened AMOC on poleward heat transport, a shoaled lower limb will further shorten timescales for carbon dioxide outgassing from the ocean to the atmosphere."

13,introduction,"Introduction Accurate climate prediction on timescales ranging from years to decades provides invaluable information for climate adaptation and resilience, thus facilitating informed decision-making among governmental agencies and industry sectors in response to the rapidly changing climate 1 . Assessing the reliability of such predictions requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms driving climate variability on decadal timescales 2 , 3 . Sources of decadal variability encompass anthropogenic external forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), natural external forcing (e.g., volcanic eruptions), and internal variability. Among these sources, internal variability can lead to large uncertainties in decadal predictions 4 – 8 , with such uncertainties possibly evolving over time due to changes in external forcing 9 – 13 . The North Atlantic Ocean exhibits prominent interannual-to-multidecadal variability, as documented in both observational 14 – 17  and modeling studies 18 – 20 . This variability influences regional and global climate, such as North American heat waves 21 , North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity 22 , Arctic sea ice extent 23 , Asian monsoon patterns 24 , and precipitation worldwide 25 – 28 . Numerous studies have delved into understanding the mechanisms that govern North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variability 29 – 35 . However, what remains an open question is how anthropogenic external forcing may modulate internal variability in the North Atlantic on decadal timescales. With anthropogenic emissions such as greenhouse gases and aerosols, the mean state of the North Atlantic can experience rapid changes. One notable example is the projected weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in a warming climate, which can be attributed to increased heat and freshwater flux into the ocean, and thus a reduction or cessation of North Atlantic deep convection 36 – 39 . The AMOC is a key driver of poleward heat transport in the North Atlantic Ocean 40 – 42 . Therefore, the weakened AMOC has various climate impacts, including the so-called North Atlantic warming hole 38 , 43 – 46  and its related atmospheric impacts 47 – 49 , which vary with AMOC decline rates in different model simulations 50 . Given these mean changes under external forcing, it is crucial to examine how North Atlantic internal variability may evolve in response. In this study, the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) 51  is used to elucidate the impact of external forcing on decadal variability in the North Atlantic SST. Unlike the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which contains uncertainties arising from model structure and physics, a single model initial-condition large ensemble such as the CESM2-LE contains a set of simulations from a single climate model under an identical forcing scenario 52 . The ensemble spread thus arises solely from perturbations in the initial conditions. This approach facilitates the separation of the forced component (ensemble mean) and internal variability (deviations from ensemble mean), enabling the assessment of changes in internal variability in response to external forcing. In this study, we identify pronounced differences in the trajectories of northern North Atlantic SST among ensemble members during the mid-twenty-first century. We attribute these distinct trajectories to the different rates of North Atlantic deep convection reduction among ensemble members. We hypothesize that these differences are initiated by stochastic atmospheric variability and amplified by positive feedbacks activated by the mean freshwater forcing induced by global warming."
14,results,"Results Change of internal decadal variability over time Decadal variability in North Atlantic SST is isolated by applying a lowpass filter (11-year running mean) to winter (December-January-February-March, DJFM) North Atlantic SST for each member of the CESM2-LE. We find an increased ensemble spread across the 100 ensemble members during the mid-twenty-first century that is concentrated north of 50°N (see Supplementary Movie  1 ), indicating a wider range of possible future northern North Atlantic climate states compared to those in the historical period. This region is among the regions with the highest predictability in initialized decadal predictions under current climate conditions 53 – 56 . To evaluate changes in this region under global warming, an index of northern North Atlantic SST (NNASST) is computed as the area-average over the 50–80°N, 90°W–40°E domain (Supplementary Fig.  1a ). This analysis identifies a pronounced increase in NNASST ensemble standard deviation from 2040–2070, with the maximum standard deviation occurring during 2056–2060 (gray line in Fig.  1 a).

The shadings are the ensemble spread, calculated as ensemble mean ± one ensemble standard deviation (STD), for the warm (orange) and cold (blue) groups. Black dots on the lower axis signify years when these ensemble means are significantly different at the 95% level based on a two-tailed Student’s  t -test. The same significance test applies to Figs.  2 – 4 ,  6 . Magenta dots on the upper axis mark years 2056–2060, which are the 5 years with the maximum STD of NNASST. The gray line in ( a ) is the STD of NNASST across 100 ensemble members. The dashed black line in ( b ) is a MLD threshold of 80 m, which is used to generate the histogram in Supplementary Fig.  4 . This increase in North Atlantic internal variability might be stochastic in nature and thus unpredictable, or it could stem from processes that, when traced back, may provide some predictability. To identify the onset of the broadened SST distribution and any potential precursors, we classify ensemble members into warm and cold groups, then conduct composite analyses of these groups. The classification of ensemble members is based on their winter NNASST during the 5 years with the highest NNASST standard deviation (2056–2060). Specifically, ensemble members are assigned to the warm (cold) group if their NNASST index is greater (smaller) than or equal to the ensemble mean plus (minus) one standard deviation of the NNASST in the CESM2 preindustrial control (piControl) simulation 57  during any of these 5 years. The classification yields 40 members in the warm group and 31 members in the cold group and is not sensitive to the choice of season (DJF vs. DJFM vs. annual) or domain. Our results are also robust to different classification methods (Supplementary Figs.  2, 3 ). Figure  1 a displays the ensemble mean and spread of the lowpass-filtered DJFM NNASST index for both the warm and cold groups from 1920 to 2094. The ensemble means of these two groups diverge significantly from one another, starting from 2035 and persisting until the end of the simulation, with the maximum separation occurring during 2050–2070. This result implies that there are distinct trajectories of NNASST in these groups that start ∼20 years before the maximum spread in internal variability. Furthermore, if it were possible to identify which trajectory is being taken, it would suggest the potential for multidecadal predictability of NNASST in the mid-twenty-first century. The distinction between the cold and warm groups emerges from the Labrador Sea region in the 2030s and expands progressively across the entire mid-to-high latitude North Atlantic in the following decades, indicating an earlier formation of the North Atlantic warming hole in the cold group (Fig.  2 ). Based on this spatial development, we attribute part of the large-scale SST difference between the groups to the transport of colder water from the Labrador Sea to the subpolar North Atlantic in the cold group compared to the warm group (see the following section for more details). In addition to the transport from the Labrador Sea, the AMOC plays a dominant role in poleward heat transport 40 , which can be tied back to deep convection in the Labrador Sea in CESM 20 , 35 , 58 , 59 . As such, we assess the Labrador Sea mixed layer depth (MLD), northward heat transport (NHT) across 50°N, and the AMOC at 50°N for both the warm and cold groups (Fig.  1 b–d) to investigate their potential roles in driving the distinct NNASST trajectories among ensemble members. Fig. 2 Spatial evolution of sea surface temperature (SST) difference between the groups. Composite of lowpass-filtered December-January-February-March SST (°C) differences between the cold and warm groups (cold group–warm group) for every 5 years from 2025 to 2065. The absence of black hatching indicates significant differences at the 95% level. All ensemble members exhibit continuously shoaling Labrador Sea MLD (Fig.  1 b), consistent with increased ocean stratification due to anthropogenic forcing 37 . In the mid-twenty-first century, the Labrador Sea deep convection in all ensemble members gradually stops, with final MLDs fluctuating around 80 m. However, a clear distinction between the warm and cold groups emerges from 2029. The cold group has shallower MLDs, with an accelerated reduction of the Labrador Sea deep convection relative to the warm group. This acceleration culminates in an earlier Labrador Sea deep convection shutdown in the cold group, as can be seen in the 11-year difference in the median time at which MLD reaches 80 m: 2052 for the cold group and 2063 for the warm group (Fig.  1 b and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The difference in the deep convection between the warm and cold groups leads to a clear separation in their AMOC and NHT trajectories starting in 2032 and 2029, respectively (Fig.  1 c, d). The cold group has slightly weaker AMOC, which leads to reduced NHT compared to the warm group. In addition to AMOC, NHT is also impacted by changes in gyre circulation, which is known to respond more rapidly to stochastic atmospheric forcing than AMOC 35 , 60 . This gyre response might explain why the separation of NHT trajectories occurs a few years earlier than the separation of AMOC between the groups. These differences in NHT would act to intensify the differences in NNASST trajectories (Fig.  1 a). Processes driving distinct density, salinity, and temperature in the upper Labrador Sea Given that the difference in MLD shutdown rates between the groups precedes the differences in AMOC, NHT, and NNASST, it is crucial to investigate what causes the MLD difference between the groups. To start with, we examine the time evolution of the upper-1500 m ocean density averaged over the Labrador Sea region (Supplementary Fig.  1b ) and display the difference between the cold and warm groups in Fig.  3 a. Consistent with the MLD difference between the groups, the upper-ocean density in the cold group becomes significantly smaller than that in the warm group from the 2020s, with the maximum difference reached in the 2050s and located in the upper 100 m. Fig. 3 Decomposition of density for the groups. a  Differences between the cold and warm groups (cold group–warm group) in the lowpass-filtered December-January-February-March Labrador Sea density ( ρ , kg/m 3 ).  b  Same as ( a ) but for temperature’s contribution to the density (− α θ Δ θ ),  c  Same as ( a ) but for salinity’s contribution to density ( β S Δ S ). Here,  α θ  and  β S  are the thermal expansion coefficient and haline contraction coefficient, respectively, and  θ  and  S  are potential temperature and salinity (see Methods for details). The absence of black hatching indicates significant differences at the 95% level. The density of seawater depends primarily on temperature and salinity. Thus, we assess the contributions of temperature (− α θ Δ θ ) and salinity ( β S Δ S ) to the differences between the groups in the upper 1500 m over time (Fig.  3 b, c). Here,  α θ  and  β S  represent the thermal expansion coefficient and haline contraction coefficient, respectively, and  θ  and  S  denote potential temperature and salinity (see Methods for details). Notably, the pattern in Fig.  3 c closely resembles that in Fig.  3 a, whereas Fig.  3 b shows a reduced magnitude with an opposite sign. This suggests that salinity primarily drives the density difference between the groups, while the temperature has a minor damping effect. That is, the cold group has smaller upper-ocean density mainly because it is fresher than the warm group. In light of the dominant contribution of salinity, we conduct a salinity budget analysis over the upper 295 m in the Labrador Sea region (see Methods for details). The differences between the cold and warm groups for each term are depicted in Fig.  4 a. In the Labrador Sea region, a significantly smaller salinity tendency is seen in the cold group compared to the warm group during winter from the 2020s to 2058 (Fig.  4 a). The primary contributor to the smaller total salinity tendency in the cold group before 2060 is the difference in diabatic vertical mixing between the groups, which begins in the 2020s and peaks in the 2050s. The impact of vertical mixing on the upper Labrador Sea salinity variability has also been shown in previous studies 61 , 62 . Contributions from the remaining four terms are smaller but, at times, still significant. Surface flux counteracts the total salinity tendency difference, primarily due to reduced melting and precipitation in the cold group relative to the warm group (Supplementary Fig.  5a ). Parameterized advection has a minor opposing effect until about 2075. Resolved advection amplifies the negative total tendency during 2031–2040, followed by an opposing contribution from 2049. This transition in resolved advection, along with sustained opposing contributions from surface flux and parameterized advection, is responsible for the larger total salinity tendency in the cold group from the 2060s as the influence of vertical mixing declines. Lastly, the residual term modestly reinforces the negative total tendency beginning in 2036. This term encompasses lateral diffusion and K-Profile vertical mixing Parameterization (KPP; 63 ) non-local vertical mixing that are not available in the simulation employed in this study, as well as a small term, the Robert Filter tendency. Fig. 4 Salinity and heat budget analysis in the upper 295 m of the Labrador Sea. a  Differences between the cold and warm groups (cold–warm) in total salinity tendency (g/kg/yr; black), as well as contributions to the total tendency from resolved advection (orange), diabatic vertical mixing (yellow), surface flux (blue), parameterized advection (purple), and residual terms (gray). Dots indicate the years when the warm and cold groups are significantly different at the 95% level.  b  Same as ( a ) but for the temperature tendency (°C/yr). All time series are December-January-February-March-averaged and lowpass-filtered before calculating the differences. This analysis implies that the fresher upper Labrador Sea in the cold group primarily results from weaker vertical mixing compared to the warm group, limiting the upward transport of higher-salinity subsurface seawater. This leads to weaker deep convection in the cold group, which can, in turn, influence its vertical mixing (see the following section for details). These processes reduce the NNASST in the cold group through changes in AMOC. Another pathway through which the two groups diverge in their trajectories is via seawater transport from the Labrador Sea to the subpolar North Atlantic (Fig.  2 ), as discussed in the previous section. Therefore, we also conduct a heat budget analysis in the upper-295 m Labrador Sea for both groups, even though the temperature has only a minor damping effect on the Labrador Sea density difference between the groups (Fig.  3 ). The cold group has a significantly smaller total temperature tendency than the warm group from the early 2030s to the late 2050s (Fig.  4 b). One of the largest contributions to their difference is from vertical mixing. Consistent with the salinity budget analysis (Fig.  4 a), this indicates that the cold group has weaker vertical mixing compared to the warm group, which results in reduced upward transport of warm subsurface seawater. The vertical mixing term is important within regions characterized by active deep convection, such as the Labrador Sea (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). This may explain why the Labrador Sea emerges as a key area for the large-scale SST difference between the groups (Fig.  2 ). Alongside vertical mixing, the residual term is also a primary contributor to the group difference. Similar to the salinity budget analysis, this term mainly consists of lateral diffusion and KPP non-local vertical mixing that are not available in CESM2-LE. Additionally, both resolved and parameterized advection moderately contribute to the group difference. In contrast, surface heat flux consistently dampens the difference between the groups starting from around 2025, which can be primarily attributed to the reduced turbulent heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere in the cold group (Supplementary Fig.  5b ). Triggers, feedbacks, and timing of the divergent states among ensemble members A missing element in the discussion above is the initial source of the difference between the warm and cold groups. Figure  1 e shows the lowpass-filtered DJFM North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index for the warm and cold groups. The cold group has significantly smaller NAO index than the warm group from 2027 to 2038. This variability can lead to either decreased heat loss from the Labrador Sea on short timescales through associated reduced westerlies (Fig.  1 f), weaker mechanical stirring through wind stress that results in reduced vertical salinity mixing (Figs.  1 g,  4 a), or both within the cold group. These mechanisms are hypothesized to trigger the initial difference in the Labrador Sea deep convection between the groups. This difference in stochastic NAO variability is a common occurrence within the period of study, and it only persists for a short time period. Specifically, a comparable difference in the NAO index is evident around 1935 between the two groups, even with the current classification (Fig.  1 e). This NAO difference, spanning approximately a decade, leads to a significant difference in NNASST for multiple years around 1950 between the groups (Fig.  1 a). However, this difference in NNASST is relatively short-lived and does not intensify, in contrast to the divergence starting from 2035. As such, there must be amplification processes that facilitate the intensification and persistence of the divergent climate states among ensemble members. Here, we propose two feedback mechanisms that may be amplifying and extending the impact of the stochastic trigger, maintaining the divergent trajectories of NNASST. The first positive feedback is associated with the close relationship between Labrador Sea deep convection and vertical mixing. That is, in the cold group, the initially weaker deep convection restricts the upward mixing of higher-salinity subsurface seawater, which further weakens deep convection by reducing the density in the upper Labrador Sea. This feedback can accelerate the rate of deep convection shutdown in the cold group compared to the warm group (light-green; Fig.  5 ). The dominant contribution of vertical mixing to the salinity tendency difference between the groups (Fig.  4 a), and the dominant contribution of salinity to the density difference (Fig.  3 ) are evidence that this positive feedback is occurring. Fig. 5 Schematic of the trigger and two proposed positive feedbacks. The trigger is represented by the dash-dotted yellow-green box and arrow. The vertical mixing-surface salinity feedback is represented by dashed light-green boxes and arrows, and the sea ice-wind stress feedback is represented by solid dark-green boxes and arrows. The second positive feedback mechanism involves the interactions between sea ice, wind stress, and vertical mixing (dark-green; Fig.  5 ). In the cold group, weaker deep convection within the Labrador Sea region causes the Labrador Sea to become relatively colder, due to reduced vertical mixing. Simultaneously, the entire North Atlantic basin cools relative to the warm group because of large-scale ocean circulation (e.g., AMOC, Fig.  1 c) and transport originating from the Labrador Sea (Fig.  2 ). These processes contribute to reduced sea ice melting in the cold group compared to the warm group (Fig.  6 a), and the positive ice-albedo feedback 64  may further amplify the differences in SST and sea ice between the groups. The reduction in sea ice melting makes the surface ocean in the cold group less susceptible to wind stress, particularly along the sea ice edge (Fig.  6 b). Consequently, the cold group experiences less mechanical stirring than the warm group, leading to less salt being mixed upward (Fig.  6 c). This can further weaken deep convection and result in colder SST in the cold group. Evidence for this proposed mechanism can be found in the group differences in sea ice cover (Fig.  6 a), wind stress magnitude (Fig.  6 b), and salinity tendency due to vertical mixing (Fig.  6 c), all of which occur near the sea ice edge. It is notable that anomalies in Fig.  6 c do not extend as far north, confined by their climatology (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). This positive feedback explains the long-lasting difference in the wind stress magnitude between the warm and cold groups, which remains significant even when the NAO index no longer displays a significant difference between them (Figs.  1 e, g,   6 b). Fig. 6 Evidence for the sea ice-wind stress positive feedback. Lowpass-filtered December-January-February-March differences between the cold and warm groups (cold group–warm group; shadings) every 5 years from 2025 to 2065 for  a  sea ice concentration (%),  b  wind stress magnitude (N/m 2 ), and  c  contribution to salinity tendency from diabatic vertical mixing for the upper 295 m (g/kg/yr). The absence of black hatching indicates significant differences at the 95% level. In  a , dashed black line denotes the 100-member ensemble mean sea ice edge defined as the 15% ice concentration contour for the corresponding year. The identification of these feedbacks does not explain why the increase in internal variability occurs at this specific time. Figure  7  shows the ensemble mean salinity and its vertical gradient in the Labrador Sea. The vertical salinity gradient increases over time due to the continuous freshening of the surface ocean, which can be attributed to Arctic sea ice melting 37 , 45  and changes in Arctic runoff 65  caused by global warming. As a result, vertical mixing acting on this enhanced gradient can lead to greater modifications of the surface salinity. Fig. 7 Ensemble mean salinity and its vertical gradient. Lowpass-filtered December-January-February-March ensemble mean salinity (contours) and its vertical gradient (shading; approximated as the difference in salinity divided by the difference in depth between two adjacent layers) averaged over the Labrador Sea region across 100 ensemble members. Consequently, the two positive feedback mechanisms, which are heavily reliant on surface salinity fluctuations owing to vertical mixing, become particularly active from the early twenty-first century when the vertical salinity gradient increases. This indicates that external forcing drives the divergent trajectories of NNASST among ensemble members (i.e., a wider range of possible climate states due to internal variability). Similarly, a re-convergence of these trajectories can also be due to external forcing, as surface freshening can cause the cessation of deep convection in the Labrador Sea across all ensemble members 37 , 45 , ultimately leading to the termination of the related feedback mechanisms. Changes in internal SST variability in other large ensembles As this study focuses on CESM2-LE, the physical processes revealed may depend on certain specifics of this model, such as the dominant location of deep water formation (Labrador Sea) and parameterization schemes. To evaluate the generalizability of our findings, we utilize seven additional large ensembles to assess whether an increased ensemble spread of NNASST exists in other models during the mid-twenty-first century. These large ensembles include models from both CMIP5 and CMIP6, under the historical and one of three future radiative forcing scenarios, namely the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 3-7.0, SSP 5-8.5, and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 (see Methods for details). In the CESM2-LE, we identified a discrepancy of SST among different ensemble members primarily in the Labrador Sea and subpolar North Atlantic and extending further to the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas (Fig.  2  and Supplementary Movie  1 ). Based on the mechanisms identified in our study, the spatial distribution of SST discrepancy is linked to the mean response of deep convection, AMOC, and North Atlantic SST (i.e., the development of a warming hole) to global warming. These responses vary across different models, as documented in previous studies 50 , 66 . Therefore, before delving into the impact of external forcing on internal SST variability in other models, we first examine the ensemble-mean North Atlantic response to global warming. This assessment is conducted using an SST warming hole index that is shown to be closely associated with MLD and AMOC 66 , as the SST output is widely available in all the models (see Methods for details). Figure  8  reveals that a considerable number of models simulate cooling in the central subpolar North Atlantic in future climates compared to the future global mean SST, indicating the emergence of a North Atlantic warming hole. The location and magnitude of the warming hole vary among models, consistent with ref.  66 . Some models (MPI-ESM, MIROC6, GFDL-SPEAR) have a robust warming hole within the subpolar North Atlantic and opposite signed anomalies in the GIN Seas. Additionally, certain models (CanESM2, CanESM5, and ACCESS-ESM1-5) have weaker cooling and/or mixed warming and cooling signals across the subpolar North Atlantic that are not consistent with the development of a North Atlantic warming hole. Fig. 8 The response of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) to global warming in multiple large ensembles. The shading in each subplot shows the ensemble mean warming hole index (°C; see Methods for details) at each grid cell for each large ensemble. The black box denotes the domain used to calculate the area-weighted average SST standard deviation across all members of each large ensemble in Fig.  9 . Due to the inter-model spread in the warming hole location and the close relationship between the formation of the warming hole and the increase of ensemble spread (e.g., Fig.  1 a), we use a smaller common domain in the central subpolar North Atlantic (50-65°N, 40-20°W) that captures the North Atlantic warming hole across the majority of models to measure the SST ensemble spread over time for all large ensembles. Figure  9  displays the ensemble spread of the lowpass-filtered DJFM SST across all the members within each large ensemble, normalized along the time dimension for each model. The ensemble spread of CESM2-LE in the original broad domain (50-80°N, 90°W-40°E) and in the small domain remains similar. All the models with a warming hole (CESM2, MPI-ESM, CSIRO-Mk3.6, MIROC6, and GFDL-SPEAR) show a distinct increase in SST ensemble spread in the twenty-first century, albeit with different timing (Fig.  9 ). This variation in timing is expected, as the models differ in their physics and some are subject to different forcings. On the contrary, the three models without warming hole formation (CanESM2, CanESM5, ACCESS-ESM1-5) exhibit a decrease in the ensemble spread in the twenty-first century compared to the 20 th  century. It is noteworthy that limiting the domain for these “non-warming hole models” to only the relative cooling region still does not result in an increase of ensemble spread in the mid-twenty-first century. These results suggest that if a model experiences distinct deep convection shutdown and AMOC slowdown, which manifests as the formation of a North Atlantic warming hole (Fig.  8 ), it will experience an increase in internal variability in the subpolar North Atlantic (Fig.  9 ). The consistent behavior seen across all the “warming hole models” underscores the robustness of our results.

15,discussion,"Discussion Previous studies have offered valuable insights into the mechanisms driving North Atlantic SST variability using observations, piControl simulations, and historical simulations with limited realizations 29 – 35 . In this study, we utilize a single model initial-condition large ensemble containing 100 simulations that can allow us to study internal variability within the context of changes in external forcing. This addresses a gap left by previous studies, enabling us to diagnose how anthropogenic external forcing can modulate internal variability and how their interactions may improve predictability on decadal timescales. In this study, we uncover how future climate change might impact decadal variability in the North Atlantic Ocean. Using the CESM2-LE simulations, we find that the range of potential climate states in the northern North Atlantic increases dramatically in the mid-twenty-first century. We propose that distinct trajectories of NNASST originate from stochastic atmospheric variability. As global warming shifts the mean ocean state, it eventually crosses a critical “tipping point”, activating positive feedbacks. These feedbacks introduce pronounced nonlinearity into the system, magnifying the initial stochastic differences. Our findings thus highlight the critical role of external forcing in driving increased internal variability. Additional investigation of seven other large ensembles shows that this increase in internal SST variability broadly exists in models that simulate the formation of a North Atlantic warming hole under global warming, despite variations in timing across different models. While there exist debates, recent studies have provided evidence for the slowdown of the AMOC and the formation of the North Atlantic warming hole in the observations 44 , 67 – 69 . This evidence underscores the potential real-world manifestation of our findings, warranting further attention from our community. In the CESM2-LE, we identify distinct trajectories starting around 2030 that lead to either warm or cold NNASST, which then lasts for decades until the end of the simulations. This suggests a potential increase in the multidecadal predictability of North Atlantic SST, despite increased internal variability. Such added predictability on decadal timescales over the upcoming 50–70 years could hold significant socioeconomic value, informing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Here, we propose two potential avenues for future work that can leverage this enhanced predictability in reality. The first avenue involves the comparison between the observations and the model simulations. The distinct trajectories between the warm and cold groups in CESM2-LE can be identified in multiple variables (e.g., NNASST, MLD, NHT, AMOC) starting from ∼2030—only a few years from now. However, with the exception of SST, the majority of these do not have sufficiently long records in the observations. Monitoring the NNASST in the observations over the upcoming decade and comparing this to the envelope of NNASST in the CESM2-LE warm and cold groups may allow us to infer whether the observations are consistently within one trajectory or the other. From this, we may infer the North Atlantic climate state in the following 50–70 years. The second avenue for future work is related to dynamical model predictions. Current decadal prediction models generally provide predictions out to about 10 years 55 , 56 . The extended predictability revealed here suggests that these models could potentially offer skillful predictions over longer periods once the mean climate allows the activation of positive feedbacks. The differing timing of the increase in subpolar SST standard deviation suggests that the timing of crossing the “tipping point” can vary across different models. Our analysis with CESM2-LE indicates that the divergence in trajectories is triggered around 2027 in this model, pinpointing this year as the approximate time when the mean state crosses the “tipping point” that activates the positive feedbacks. Thus, we may extend the prediction period beyond the typical 10 years for dynamical predictions initialized around 2027 in the CESM2 to achieve skillful long-lead predictions. In addition to the anthropogenic external forcing and internal variability focused on in this study, previous studies have shown that natural external forcing, such as volcanic eruptions can facilitate skillful decadal SST prediction in the North Atlantic through dynamical mechanisms involving NAO and AMOC 70 – 72 . Thus, another avenue for future work is to explore how the climate impacts and predictability associated with natural external forcing may change under global warming."

17,introduction,"Introduction The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an essential part of the global ocean overturning circulation 1  and determines large-scale weather and climate around the North Atlantic 2 – 11 . The northward limb of the AMOC transports warm and saline water to the high-latitude North Atlantic where this water cools, densifies, and sinks to form the deep southward limb of the AMOC. The AMOC accounts for around 20–30% of the global meridional heat transport (MHT) from the Tropics to high latitudes in the atmosphere and ocean 12 . By transporting large amounts of heat northward, the AMOC exhibits a strong control on the climate in North America and Europe, such as the relatively mild European temperatures and large-scale precipitation patterns 13 , 14 . Moreover, the North Atlantic deep-water formation caused by the cooling of the northward-flowing saline waters 15 – 17  plays a crucial part in the global climate and the carbon cycle by transporting carbon and heat from the atmosphere and surface ocean into the deep ocean 13 , 18 – 23 . The sensitivity of North Atlantic deep-water formation to the northward transport of salinity also makes the AMOC a potential tipping element in the climate system and its tipping would have substantial effects on the global and regional climate 24 , 25 . The importance of the AMOC has motivated multiple reconstructions of AMOC variability via direct observations 1 , 26 – 28 , proxies 29 – 35 , and models 11 , 36 – 38 . Direct observations of the AMOC have been taken, for example, at the RAPID array at 26.5°N since 2004 1 , 26  and at the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) array around 55°N since 2014 28 . These direct observations present a reference for proxy and model studies and have already demonstrated the large seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal variability of the AMOC 19 , 27 , 39 – 41 . However, these observational records are not long enough to differentiate between low-frequency variability and long-term trends 39 , 42 , which is crucial to detect potential human influence on the large-scale ocean circulation over the industrial period. A differentiation between low-frequency variability and long-term trends may be achieved by proxies, which provide a longer-term perspective on past AMOC variability and trends. Among the proxies that have been used to reconstruct the strength of the AMOC over the last decades and centuries are surface ocean density anomalies 35 , isotopes in foraminifera 31  and corals 33 , salinity in the South Atlantic 43 , and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the subpolar gyre relative to northern hemispheric or global SSTs 32 , 34 . This last proxy identifies the observed cooling or lack of warming in the subpolar SST compared to global SSTs over the past century – the “warming hole” - as evidence of a reduced northward MHT caused by a reduced AMOC 32 , 34 . The relationship between the AMOC anomalies and subpolar gyre SST anomalies with respect to global SSTs (here called the SPG SST index) was calibrated by Caesar et al. with climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and then exploited with observed SPG SST anomalies since 1870 34 . Based on this reconstruction, the AMOC at 26.5°N was estimated to have declined over the last 70 years with a trend of −1.7 Sverdrup (Sv, 10 6  m 3  s − 1 ) per century 34 . Declines of the AMOC of weaker or even stronger magnitude have also been estimated based on a variety of other proxies 29 , 44 . This concept of exploiting a relationship between an observable and a non-observable variable - in this case, AMOC strength and SPG SST anomalies - with observations has been widely applied in climate science under the name of emergent constraints 22 , 45 – 49 . Emergent constraints reduce uncertainties of projections 48 – 51  and estimate past and present variables or processes that cannot be directly observed 22 , 34 , 48 . In the emergent constraint approach, models are not used to determine the unknown variable but to determine the slope and intercept of a relationship between two variables. Thus, each model has equal weight in determining that relationship even if a model does not correctly reproduce the historical trajectory of each variable. In fact, the larger the spread in the variables across the models, the more robustly one can estimate the underlying relationship that is postulated to link the two variables. In the past, however, a number of such relationships that were identified across CMIP5 model ensembles have been later discarded as they were not reproducible across CMIP6 model ensembles 49 , 52 . These relationships were not reproducible because either the mechanism underlying the assumption was incorrect and the statistical relationship occurred by chance 52  or newly included processes in CMIP6 models, which had not been not adequately been included in CMIP5 models, have altered or broken the assumed relationship 49 , 52 . Given the large amount of data and models across CMIP ensembles, relationships can emerge by chance 53 – 55 . Consequently, it has been postulated that a relationship can only be exploited with observations if that relationship is mechanistically plausible, if the underlying mechanism is verifiable, and if the relationship is replicable in any other model ensemble 56 , 57 . Despite the emergent constraint reconstruction of Caesar et al.  34  suggesting a decreasing AMOC over the last 70 years, recent studies argue that the AMOC has not yet significantly declined over the last centuries and decades 35 , 39 , 40 , 58 – 60  and that the SPG SST is not a good indicator of AMOC variability 61 – 63 . Reconstructions of the AMOC based on temperature and salinity observations, for example, demonstrate large decadal and inter-annual variability of the AMOC but no significant reduction over time 35 , 58 , 59 . Furthermore, it has been shown that SPG SST anomalies can also be driven by air-sea heat flux anomalies from the atmosphere and heat transport anomalies towards the Arctic Ocean without associated changes in the AMOC so that the SPG SST anomalies might be a weak proxy for the AMOC strength 64 . In addition, large decadal variabilities in the AMOC and SPG SST at present are likely still too large for a weakening trend to emerge 39 , 40 . Here, we build on the concept of the SPG SST as an AMOC index 32 , 34  by extending the concept to account for heat released from the ocean to the atmosphere. Instead of using SST anomalies in a pre-defined region, we construct a heat budget to identify a relationship between the AMOC anomaly at a given latitude and the air-sea heat flux anomaly north of that latitude in the North Atlantic basin across an ensemble of 24 climate models from CMIP6 (Supplementary Table  1 ). We then exploit this relationship with observation-based estimates from reanalysis products ERA5 65  and JRA-55 66  to reconstruct the decadal averaged AMOC anomaly since 1963."
18,results,"Results The subpolar gyre sea surface temperature index in CMIP6 When calculating the SPG SST index with CMIP6 models in the same way as it was done for CMIP5 models 34 , a relationship between trends in the SPG SST index from 1870 to 2016 and trends of the AMOC from 1870 to 2016 emerges (Fig.  1 ) as previously shown 67 . While the existence of this relationship corroborates the underlying link between the AMOC and the SPG SST index, the coefficient of determination (r 2 ) of the relationship of 0.5 is substantially smaller than the one that was found for the CMIP5 ensemble (0.90) 34 . However, the high coefficient of determination across the 12 models from CMIP5 might have been a consequence of the relatively small number of simulations that were used to calibrate the relationship between the SPG SST index and the AMOC 34 . When including 4–5 times more CMIP5 model simulations 67 , a similar spread as across the CMIP6 ensemble appears. It thus appears that the AMOC affects the SPG SST index as postulated 32 , 34 , but that the link is indeed weaker than expected. Fig. 1 Relationship between trends in the AMOC at 26.5°N and the SPG SST index from 1870 to 2016 across 24 climate models from CMIP6. Trends of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) at 26.5°N and subpolar gyre sea surface temperature (SPG SST) index as calculated by Caesar et al.  34  from 1870 to 2016 (circles) with the uncertainties (1-σ) of the trends (lines). Climate models where trends in both the AMOC and SPG SST index are statistically significant ( p  < 0.05) are shown in orange and climate models where the trends in the AMOC and/or the SPG SST index are not statistically significant are shown in black.

A linear fit (dashed blue line) was calculated across all climate models with the associated projection uncertainty (1-σ) (blue shading). The observed trend of the SPG SST index as calculated by Caesar et al.  34  is shown as a grey line. The linear fit across 12 climate models from CMIP5 34  is shown as a green dashed line. The weaker than previously assumed relationship is likely due to mechanisms that affect either the AMOC or the SPG SST index but not both at the same time 61 – 63  and due to the different locations of the warming hole. In the CMIP6 ensemble, 10 of the 24 climate models have a statistically significant ( p  < 0.05) trend in one variable and no statistically significant trend in the other (Fig.  1 , Supplementary Figs.  1  and  2 ). Some models show, for example, a change in the SPG SST index without an associated change in the AMOC, which might be a consequence of a potentially overly strong sensitivity to aerosol forcing in some CMIP6 models 67 . Although the aerosol sensitivity might be too strong in the CMIP6 models, the resulting SPG SST change should also result in an associated AMOC change if both variables were strongly linked. While aerosols are one example of how the AMOC and the SPG SST index can be affected independently, there are likely others 61 – 63 , such as air-sea heat flux anomalies from the atmosphere and heat transport anomalies towards the Arctic Ocean 64 . Another reason for these weak correlations might be that the pre-defined SPG region covers an area that is substantially larger than the ‘warming holes’ or ‘warming hotspots’ in most climate models (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Thus, SST noise in the large remaining part of the SPG may obscure the actual signal. Not only is the relationship across the 24 CMIP6 models substantially weaker than previously estimated based on 12 CMIP5 model simulations 34 , but the slope and intercept of the relationship also vary between both model ensembles. In the CMIP5 ensemble 34 , the slope of the relationship (3.8 Sv K − 1 ) is more than twice as large as it is in the CMIP6 ensemble (1.6 Sv K − 1 ), and the intercept (0.0 Sv) is smaller in the CMIP5 ensemble than in the CMIP6 ensemble (0.5 Sv). The larger intercept might be a consequence of the relatively large impact of aerosols on the AMOC and the relatively small or even opposite impact of aerosols on SPG SSTs 67 . As a consequence of the different slopes and intercepts, the observed change in the SPG SST index from 1870 to 2016 of −0.44 °C per century results in a trend of the AMOC of −0.2 ± 0.7 Sv per century when using the CMIP6 models, which is not significantly different from zero, and substantially smaller than the trend of −1.7 Sv per century found for CMIP5 34  and not significantly different from zero. The results based on the CMIP5 model ensemble cannot thus be reproduced with the CMIP6 model ensemble, indicating that the relationship is too uncertain to enable robust reconstructions of AMOC trends over the last century and beyond. Even if the AMOC and SPG SST trends are weak on centennial timescales, strong variability in the AMOC might permit tighter constraints on the relationship between the AMOC and SPG SST index, and allow SST-based reconstructions of the past AMOC on annual or decadal timescales 39 . However, the relationship between the AMOC and the SPG SST index across the CMIP6 model ensemble is also small to almost non-existent on annual ( r 2  = 0.15), decadal ( r 2  = 0.30), and centennial ( r 2  = 0.12) timescales over the historical period (Fig.  2a ), indicating that the SPG SST index is not a robust proxy for AMOC variability for the past. Nevertheless, a relationship between the AMOC and the SPG SST index emerges over the 21st century when anomalies of the AMOC and the SPG SST index are large (Fig.  2b, c ). This emerging relationship demonstrates that the underlying mechanism between AMOC, MHT, and SPG SST anomalies exists. However, for a robust SST anomaly to emerge within the SPG across climate models from CMIP6, the AMOC decline must be substantial (>±1.5 Sv, for example, CNRM-CM6-1 in Fig.  1 ). Consequently, a reconstruction of the decadal averaged AMOC based on the AMOC-SPG SST index relationship results in uncertainties of more than ±2 Sv and similarly large deviations between the directly simulated and reconstructed AMOC (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Overall, it seems to be impossible to identify AMOC anomalies in the range of ±1.5 Sv based on the SPG SST index and climate models from CMIP6, and even more so to derive potential tipping of the AMOC based on variability in the SPG SST index 68 , 69 . Fig. 2 AMOC anomalies at 26.5°N vs Atlantic subpolar gyre SST anomalies across climate models from CMIP6 at various timescales. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomalies are calculated at 26.5°N for 24 climate models individually with respect to a linear trend over the time period in the pre-industrial AMOC simulations of each model that corresponds to the time period in the historical simulations. The subpolar gyre sea surface temperature (SPG SST) anomalies following Caesar et al.  34  are calculated with respect to a linear trend over the time period in the pre-industrial AMOC simulations of each model that corresponds to the time period in the historical simulations. Blue dots indicate averages of the respective anomalies from  a  1850 to 2016, and from 2017 to 2100 under  b  SSP1-2.6 and  c  SSP5-8.5. Orange dots indicate decadal averages of the anomalies from  a  the 1850s to the 2010s, and from  b, c  the 2020s to the 2090s. Green dots show annual averaged anomalies from  a  1850 to 2016, and  b, c  from 2017 to 2100. Only the relationship for overall averages in ( a ) is not statistically significant. North Atlantic Ocean heat budget While the relationship between anomalies of the AMOC and the SPG SST index on annual, decadal, or centennial timescales appears weak, a strong relationship exists between AMOC anomalies at a given latitude and air-sea heat flux anomalies in the North Atlantic north of that latitude on decadal to centennial timescales (Fig.  3 ). This relationship between AMOC anomalies and air-sea heat flux anomalies is physically linked to the heat budget over the North Atlantic Ocean (Fig.  4 ) and has been identified in observations 70 . Here we define the North Atlantic as the region bounded by the combination of Davis Strait, Fram Strait, and Barents Sea Opening to the north and bounded in the south by the latitude where the AMOC anomaly is to be determined. Fig. 3 AMOC anomalies at 26.5°N vs air-sea heat flux anomalies north of 26.5°N across climate models from CMIP6 at various timescales. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomalies are calculated at 26.5°N for 24 climate models individually with respect to a linear trend over the time period in the pre-industrial AMOC simulations of each model that corresponds to the time period in the historical simulations. The North Atlantic air-sea flux anomalies north of 26.5°N and south of the Arctic (see orange area in Fig.  4  and methods for a detailed definition of the region) are calculated with respect to linear trend over the time period in the pre-industrial AMOC simulations of each model that corresponds to the time period in the historical simulations. Blue dots indicate averages of the respective anomalies from  a  1850 to 2016, and from 2017 to 2100 under  b  SSP1-2.6 and  c  SSP5-8.5. Orange dots indicate decadal averages of the anomalies from  a  the 1850s to the 2010s, and from  b ,  c  the 2020s to the 2090s. Green dots show annual averaged anomalies from  a  1850 to 2016, and  b ,  c  from 2017 to 2100. Positive heat flux anomalies indicate an increased heat flux from the atmosphere into the ocean. Fig. 4 Schematic representation of the North Atlantic heat budget. Heat transport into the region from the south (red) can be compensated by: (1) heat transport out of the region to the north (green), (2) heat loss to the atmosphere (blue), or (3) a change in Ocean Heat Content (orange). Generally, a regional ocean heat budget can be written as heat content change in that region being equal to the sum of the fluxes across the region’s boundary: 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

MHT in the North Atlantic decays strongly northward from a peak of around 1.2 PW at 26.5°N to around 0.5 PW at 50°N 71 , 72  due to heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere. The largest anomalies across the components of the North Atlantic heat budget over the historical period are simulated in the southern MHT (1.6 ZJ yr − 1 , mean of absolute values between 1850 and 2014) and surface heat flux (1.4 ZJ yr − 1 ) terms, while anomalies in heat storage (0.7 ZJ yr − 1 ) and Arctic MHT (0.4 ZJ yr − 1 ) are smaller (Fig.  5 ). The southern MHT and surface heat fluxes are the dominant heat budget components in all models, although individual models simulate different magnitudes and frequencies of the variability. These differences might be explained by a different base state of the North Atlantic across models, as the projected decline in the AMOC is also state-dependent 36 , 73 , or by different internal variability, for example, internal changes in ocean circulation 74 , or sensitivities to external drivers, such as atmospheric driven air-sea heat fluxes, across the model ensemble 75 – 77 . Independent of the driver and magnitude of the variability of the components of the North Atlantic heat budget, a change in the southern MHT over the historical period is largely compensated in climate models by a change in surface heat fluxes and less so by a change in the ocean heat content or the heat flux toward the Arctic Ocean 78 . Fig. 5 Historical decadal variability of the North Atlantic heat budget north of 26.5°N from 1850 to 2020. Timeseries smoothed with a 11-year running mean (±5 years) of the North Atlantic ocean heat content change north of 26.5°N (blue), the anomaly of the air-sea heat flux in the same region (orange), the anomaly of the northward heat flux at 26.5°N (green), and the residual representing the heat flux to the Arctic Ocean (grey) for the  a  multi-model mean across an ensemble of 18 climate models and  b – s  for each model individually. The missing 6 climate models from the total ensemble of 24 climate models did not provide the northward heat transport and are therefore not shown here. The dominance of these two anomalies in the North Atlantic heat budget and the strong relationship between the AMOC and southern MHT lead to the tight relationship between AMOC anomalies and air-sea heat flux anomalies even for AMOC changes smaller than ±1.5 Sv (Fig.  3 ). Across the ensemble of 18 climate models from CMIP6, the AMOC variability at 26.5°N is strongly related to the annual ( r 2  = 0.84), decadal ( r 2  = 0.94), and centennial ( r 2  = 0.98) variability of northward MHT at the same latitude (Fig.  6b ). The relationship between the AMOC and the southern MHT is strong because the variability of the volume of the water transported northward by the AMOC is much larger than the variability of the temperature of that water 79 – 81 . The variability of southern MHT anomaly is then linked to the variability of the air-sea heat flux in the North Atlantic on decadal ( r 2  = 0.71) and centennial timescales ( r 2  = 0.93) (Fig.  6a ). On annual timescales, however, the southern MHT anomaly is only very weakly linked to the variability of the air-sea heat flux in the North Atlantic ( r 2  = 0.19). This weak link on annual timescales suggests that other terms such as the change in OHC could be important, and atmospheric dynamics override the overall importance of southern MHT from the tropical Atlantic Ocean 70 , 82 , 83 . However, on longer timescales, the oceanic variability dominates so that the southern MHT anomalies are strongly linked to air-sea heat flux anomalies. As a result, the North Atlantic air-sea heat flux anomalies are a close proxy for AMOC anomalies on decadal and centennial timescales (Figs.  3  and  5 ). Fig. 6 Meridional heat transport anomalies across 26.5°N compared to North Atlantic air-sea heat flux north of 26.5°N, and AMOC anomalies at 26.5°N. Correlations are shown  a  between southern meridional heat transport (MHT) anomalies and North Atlantic air-sea heat flux anomalies, and  b  between southern MHT anomalies and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomalies. AMOC and northward heat flux anomalies are calculated at 26.5°N for 18 climate models individually with respect to each climate model pre-industrial AMOC. The North Atlantic air-sea flux anomalies in the north of 26.5°N are calculated with respect to each climate model's pre-industrial air-sea heat fluxes for each model individually. Blue dots indicate averages of the respective anomalies from 1850 to 2016, orange dots indicate decadal averages of the anomalies from the 1850s to the 2010s, and green dots show annual averaged anomalies from 1850 to 2016. A positive heat flux anomaly indicates an increased heat flux from the atmosphere into the ocean. The heat budget method is distinct from the frequently used Walin framework 84 – 86 , which infers ocean circulation from surface buoyancy fluxes. The Walin framework aggregates the water mass transformation between sets of outcropping isopycnals and implies a causal relationship in which the surface buoyancy fluxes force the ocean dynamics 86 – 91 . As opposed to the Walin framework, the heat budget mechanism described here relies on surface heat fluxes and does not provide information about a causal relationship; these fluxes are simply connected through Eq. ( 2 ). Although a lead-lag correlation analysis of the climate models from CMIP6 shows that air-sea heat fluxes lead the AMOC on average by around 3 years (Supplementary Fig.  5 ), similar correlations exist also for a lead of air-sea heat fluxes by 10 years and for a lead by the AMOC by 7 years. As different mechanisms appear to be linking the AMOC and air-sea heat flux anomalies 86 – 93 , we do not attempt to infer a causal relationship and simply rely on the heat budget that averages over these lead/lag relationships and holds on decadal timescales. A second advantage of the heat budget approach is that it is a bulk estimate integrated over a wide geographic region and thus avoids the same spatial biases as the SPG SST index (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Spatially, the maximum coefficient of determination ( r 2 ) between the AMOC and the heat flux anomalies occurs in the subpolar North Atlantic, similar to the maximum  r 2  between the AMOC and SST anomalies (Fig.  7 ). The similarity between the spatial patterns underlines that changes in air-sea heat fluxes and SPG SST are linked. However, the local  r 2  is higher when using heat fluxes instead of SST (compare panels a and b in Fig.  7 ), suggesting that air-sea heat fluxes dampen the SST changes and are thus more tightly connected to the AMOC. Previous studies have also found that changes in the MHT in the western part of the subpolar gyre are strongly compensated by air-sea heat fluxes 78 , 94 . Fig. 7 Correlation between decadal averaged AMOC anomalies at 26.5 °C and decadal averaged local SST and air-sea heat flux anomalies across climate models from CMIP6. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomalies are calculated at 26.5°N for 24 climate models individually with respect to a linear trend over the time period in the pre-industrial AMOC simulations of each climate model that corresponds to the time period in the historical simulations. The North Atlantic air-sea flux anomalies are calculated for each model with respect to a linear trend of the North Atlantic air-sea heat fluxes over the time period in the pre-industrial simulations of each model that corresponds to the time period in the historical simulations. Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are calculated with respect to the globally averaged SST and averaged from November to May. Decadal averages of all anomalies were calculated over 15 decades from 1871 to 2020. Finally, the coefficient of determination between AMOC anomalies and  a  air-sea heat flux anomalies and  b  SST anomalies as well as the correlation coefficient between the AMOC anomalies and  c  air-sea heat flux anomalies and  d  SST anomalies are calculated. The black lines indicate the subpolar gyre region as defined by Caesar et al.  34 . The maps were produced using the Basemap tool in Python. Testing the capability of air-sea heat fluxes to reconstruct the AMOC using climate models To test how well air-sea heat fluxes can reconstruct decadal AMOC anomalies simulated by each model, we calculated a linear regression and 1-σ prediction intervals over decadal averaged anomalies of the AMOC and of the air-sea heat flux (as shown in Fig.  3 ) across all climate models but one. We then combined this relationship with the directly simulated air-sea heat flux anomaly from the climate model that was excluded from the fit to estimate that model’s AMOC anomalies (Fig.  8 , Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The comparison between the reconstructed and directly simulated AMOC demonstrates that the air-sea heat flux anomalies can indeed be used to reconstruct the net AMOC anomalies until the 1990s and that the reconstruction provides an upper limit that diverges at most 1 Sv from the net AMOC anomaly afterwards. The heat fluxes detect (1) long-term decadal AMOC variabilities as in CMCC-CM2-SR5 (Fig.  8c ), (2) AMOC increases around 2000 as in HadGEM3-GC31-LL (Fig.  8m ), and (3) AMOC reductions in recent decades as in GFDL-CM4 (Fig.  8w ). While the reconstruction is not perfect, e.g., the variability of the reconstructed AMOC can be too low (e.g., Fig.  8I, r ) or too high (Fig.  8s, t ), the directly simulated AMOC is within the 2-sigma range of the reconstructed AMOC for 95% of all years, which is expected for a normally distributed error term. Also, the horizontal model resolution does not appear to change the ability to reconstruct the AMOC, as differences between the directly simulated and the reconstructed AMOC are not substantially different between models of different resolutions (see for example the GFDL, MPI, CNRM, and HadGEM models in Fig.  8  and Supplementary Fig.  6 ). To further corroborate the relationship between AMOC and air-sea heat flux anomalies, we also successfully tested the relationship using the pre-industrial control simulations (Supplementary Figs.  7  and  8 ) and climate models from CMIP5 (Supplementary Fig.  9 ) (see “Methods” section for details). The consistency in the relationship between air-sea heat flux anomalies and AMOC anomalies across CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles despite the difference in the effect of aerosol forcing between CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 67  further supports the finding that air-sea heat fluxes and the AMOC are indeed mechanistically connected. Fig. 8 Directly simulated and reconstructed decadal averaged AMOC anomalies at 26.5°N in each model. The simulated decadal averaged Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomaly at 26.5°N (orange line) and the reconstructed AMOC anomalies at 26.5°N based on air-sea heat flux anomalies (blue line) for 24 climate models ( a – x ). The blue shading shows the 2-sigma standard deviation that results from the uncertainty of the linear fit. The dashed black line shows zero anomalies. After 1990–2000, the air-sea heat flux-based reconstructions provided an upper limit as indicated by a too-weak reconstructed AMOC in comparison to the directly simulated AMOC in some historical simulations after 1990–2000, when ocean heat uptake started to accelerate 95 . This additional air-sea heat flux anomaly due to anthropogenic warming incorrectly results in a decline of the reconstructed AMOC in these climate models (Fig.  8 ), and is hence not visible in the reconstructions across the pre-industrial control simulations (Supplementary Figs.  7  and  8 ). Such a difference between the directly simulated and the reconstructed AMOC is larger than 1 Sv and exceeds the 2-sigma range in models with high equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECSs), for example, CanESM5, CanESM5-CanOE, IPSL-CM6A-LR, or UKESM1-0-LL (Fig.  8  and Supplementary Fig.  6 ) 96 . These models all share an ECS that exceeds the recently assessed likely range 97 . The excessive ECS in these climate models has led to an overly strong warming over the recent decades 96 . This strong atmospheric warming then leads to additional air-sea heat flux into the Atlantic Ocean (Fig.  5  and Supplementary Fig.  10 ). As the historic warming and the ECSs are outside of observed and assessed ranges 96 – 98 , we interpret this mismatch as an exception, rather than the rule of the surface flux reconstruction method. Hence, we conclude that the identified relationship across climate models between AMOC and air-sea heat flux anomalies can be used with confidence until 1990–2000 but may be biased low by up to 1 Sv over the last 20–30 years. In the future, stronger atmospheric warming and associated ocean heat uptake (Fig.  3 b,  c , and Supplementary Fig.  10 ) will further increase the difference between the simulated and reconstructed AMOC based on air-sea heat flux anomalies. While these reconstructions still provide an upper limit for an AMOC decline, air-sea heat fluxes due to atmospheric warming will need to be considered in the coming decades. Reconstructing the historical AMOC with observation-based air-sea heat flux anomalies We now use observation-based estimates of the North Atlantic air-sea heat flux anomaly north of 26.5°N from reanalysis products to reconstruct the historical AMOC variability at 26.5°N. Here, we use annual air-sea heat fluxes in the North Atlantic from ERA5 65  and JRA-55 66  to create a timeseries of the decadal averaged AMOC over the satellite period from 1958 to 2022. Although ERA5 extends until 1940, we here rely only on the period when both reanalysis datasets provide data and comparisons can be made between products. Based on the observation-based air-sea heat flux estimates, we confirm the absence of an overall trend of the AMOC but find decadal variability. The AMOC reconstructions at 26.5°N using ERA5 and JRA-55 (Fig.  9a ) suggest a relatively stable AMOC over the last decades with anomalies fluctuating between ±2 Sv. This variability is much smaller than the AMOC variability in climate models (Fig.  8 ). Across both reconstructions, a positive trend for the AMOC at 26.5°N can be found from 1963 to 2017 of 0.022 ± 0.005 Sv per decade (ERA5) and 0.022 ± 0.003 Sv per decade (JRA-55). The uncertainties (shading in Fig.  9 ) are solely based on the linear fit (Fig.  3 ) and do not include the uncertainties of the observation-based surface heat flux anomalies themselves 99 . Due to the size of these uncertainties, the detected trends are likely not statistically significant. However, a negative trend is unlikely, especially given that atmospheric warming would lead to a negative bias in the reconstructed AMOC over this period. Fig. 9 Constraining historical decadal AMOC variability across different latitudes. Reconstructed decadal averaged Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomalies with respect to the period from 1963 to 2017 at  a  26.5°N,  b  30°N,  c  35°N,  d  40°N,  e  45°N,  f  50°N, and  g  55°N based on air-sea heat flux anomalies from ERA5 (blue) and JRA-55 (orange) integrated over the North Atlantic between that latitude and the Arctic Ocean (see “Methods” section for detailed description of the regions boundaries). Decadal averages from 2009 to 2017 are shown in ( a ) for the observed AMOC at the RAPID array (black). As the anomaly for the RAPID observations was calculated with respect to the mean over 2009 and 2017, we do not expect them to be at the same level on the y-axis as the anomaly of the reconstructed AMOC timeseries that were calculated with respect to the entire period from 1963 to 2017. For a better visual comparison of the time development and trend, we have hence added an offset of 0.8 Sv to the RAPID anomaly so that it is close to the two reconstructions in absolute magnitude. Shadings indicate the 1-σ uncertainty range based on uncertainties of the relationship between AMOC and air-sea heat flux anomalies across the model ensemble. Uncertainties from the observation-based estimates of the air-sea heat flux anomalies from the reanalysis products are not represented. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. The reconstructed AMOC timeseries from ERA5 and JRA-55 both exhibit decadal variability. The timeseries show a slight increase in the AMOC from 1995 to 2005 followed by a slight decrease afterwards (Fig.  9 ). Before 1995, the AMOC reconstructions diverge, especially over the subtropics (26–35°N), though they remain within the uncertainties. This difference between the reconstructions, which is not statistically significant, could be due to the differences in the representation of aerosols, which strongly influence the atmosphere and heat budget in the North Atlantic. In ERA5, aerosols evolve over time based on an observation-based forcing that was developed for CMIP5 65 , whereas aerosols in JRA-55 are prescribed as a constant climatology 66 . Instead, JRA-55 indirectly incorporates variability in aerosols through its data assimilation of observations, which are subject to realistic aerosol forcing. As we can only reconstruct decadal variability with this method, a comparison to directly observed decadal AMOC variability based on observations from the RAPID array from 2005 to 2022 is only possible for the years 2010–2017. Although this is a very short period and we do not place much emphasis on this relationship, the small decline over this period of the AMOC in observations is in line with the decline over the same period in the ERA5 and JRA-55 reconstructions. Reconstructing the AMOC anomaly at various latitudes Reconstructing the AMOC anomalies with air-sea heat fluxes also has the benefit that it allows reconstructing the AMOC at any latitude in the North Atlantic (Fig.  9 ). Across the ensemble of 24 climate models, we find an  r 2  above or equal to 0.7 for decadal averaged values from 26.5°N to 45°N. North of 45°N, the relationships become weaker with  r 2  decreasing to 0.63 at 50°N and to 0.39 at 55°N (Table  1 ). At such high latitudes, there are two effects that reduce the correlations: (1) the MHT through the southern face is less dominant over the MHT into the Arctic so the air-sea heat fluxes are not as strongly related to AMOC anomalies anymore, and (2) the relationship between the AMOC defined in depth coordinates and MHT breaks down 100 . Much of the MHT at these latitudes is carried by the horizontal circulation patterns, and it is more instructive to consider the AMOC in density coordinates 101 – 104 . Since the density-coordinate AMOC is only provided by a few CMIP models 105 , we restrict our analysis to depth coordinates. On longer timescales, the  r 2  values over the period from 1850 to 2016 decline from above 0.9 at 45°N to 0.86 at 50°N and 0.66 at 55°N. The still relatively high  r 2  for averages over such a long period even at higher latitudes suggest that the MHT to the Arctic Ocean induces additional decadal variability at high latitudes but a weaker long-term signal than AMOC changes.

Overall, the reconstructions of the decadal averaged AMOC anomalies from 30°N to 55°N show different trends and decadal variability from 1963 to 2017. Trends increase from 26.5°N to 40°N, where they reach 0.35 ± 0.03 Sv per decade (ERA5) and 0.46 ± 0.07 Sv per decade (JRA-55). At these latitudes, multidecadal variability is likely strong 58 , and thus a longer record would be required to detect a trend. Our AMOC reconstruction at 45°N is similar to that derived from hydrographic data 58  in that it has a weak AMOC centred around 1970 and a strong AMOC in the 1980s and 1990s, weakening in the 2000s. It seems to differ however from the subpolar AMOC reconstructions in Jackson et al.  39  extending back to 1993, and is instead more in line with the AMOC reconstruction at 50°N from forced models 39 , 106 . This latter result also holds for the subtropical AMOC indices reported in Jackson et al.  107 . Further north, these trends decrease to 0.02 ± 0.01 Sv per decade (ERA5) and 0.17 ± 0.04 Sv per decade (JRA-55). As opposed to the long-term trends, the decadal variability dampens towards higher latitudes. The different time-evolutions at different latitudes highlight that the AMOC is not a simple conveyor belt but more complex and heterogeneous across latitudes 101 , 108 , 109 ."
19,discussion,"Discussion While reconstructions based on air-sea heat flux anomalies have been shown here to be more robust than previous reconstructions based on SPG SST anomalies 34 , they also come with limitations and caveats. The most important limitations are the limitations of the climate models in the CMIP6 ensemble, the limitations of the observation-based estimates, and consequently the limitations of the emergent constraint approach that exploits the link between air-sea heat flux and AMOC anomalies in climate models with the observation-based estimates of air-sea heat flux anomalies. Limitations of climate models in simulating the ocean have been widely discussed, in particular for emergent constraints on ocean properties 22 , 47 – 50 , 110 . Climate models have, for example, horizontal and vertical resolution (Supplementary Fig. Table  1 ) that do not resolve mesoscale and sub-mesoscale processes 111 – 113 , which affect the AMOC 37 , 114 , 115 . However, the relationship between air-sea heat flux anomalies and AMOC anomalies identified here exists over a wide range of model resolutions (Supplementary Table  1 ) from a coarse model resolution of 2° × 2.5° × 40 depth levels (GISS-E2.1-G) to an eddy-permitting resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° × 75 depth levels (GFDL-CM4), which gives confidence that our results are not specific to a coarse resolution model. In addition, climate models do not include all processes that are relevant for the AMOC and heat uptake in the North Atlantic. The most prominent process is likely the impact of freshwater input from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are not dynamically included in climate models in CMIP6. Such ice sheet melting, when prescribed as a boundary flux in an ocean model with prescribed atmospheric forcing, can lead to an AMOC decrease at the OSNAP array of around 2 Sv until 2014 114 . A recent study, however, has demonstrated that the effect in a coupled Earth System Model is around 3 times smaller due to a compensating temperature feedback that cannot emerge in an ocean-only model 115 . Therefore, the missing ice sheet melts in the CMIP6 ensemble of coupled climate models likely plays a limited role. Observational-based estimates have limitations as the available observations of atmospheric and sea surface temperatures lead to large uncertainties of the observation-based air-sea heat flux products. These uncertainties are most pronounced in the early part of each timeseries. As a result, the uncertainties of the reconstructed AMOC anomalies are relatively large (±2 Sv; 2-σ range). Within these uncertainties, the reconstructions of the AMOC based on ERA5 and JRA-55 are in agreement although decadal trends of the best estimates vary between both products (Fig.  9 ). However, a decline of the AMOC over the last 60 years appears to be unlikely given the increasing trend of the AMOC in both products since around 1990. Furthermore, additional air-sea heat flux from atmospheric warming would bias the reconstructed AMOC from ERA5 and JRA-55 towards too low anomalies since 1990 (Fig.  8  and Supplementary Fig.  6 ), which makes a decrease in the AMOC over the last three decades even more unlikely. To reconstruct the AMOC based on a relationship across an ensemble of climate models, several conditions have to be met 56 , 57 : The relationship must be based on a plausible mechanism, and that mechanism must be verified, for example by additional output from the climate model ensemble, and the relationship must hold in out-of-sample testing. Here, we provide such a plausible mechanism (Figs.  4 ,  5  and  6 ) that is based on previous studies 32 , 34 . With the heat budget analysis in the North Atlantic, i.e., the northward heat flux anomalies and changes in the ocean heat content, we verify that this mechanism is indeed the underlying reason for the strong relationship between air-sea heat flux anomalies and AMOC anomalies on decadal and longer timescales. Finally, we tested our approach with out-of-sample testing for each model in the pre-industrial control simulations (Supplementary Figs.  7  and  8 ) and historical simulations (Fig.  8  and Supplementary Fig.  6 ) and also across CMIP5 climate models (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). These tests were successful for all climate models in the pre-industrial control simulations and for most climate models in the historical simulations. Due to anthropogenic warming in the last decades, a small bias of 1 Sv towards too low reconstructed AMOCs may arise once anthropogenic warming leads to additional air-sea heat flux anomalies that are not related to the AMOC. However, that bias is well within the uncertainties. Only the climate models with excessive ECS have reconstructed AMOC anomalies that are more than 2-sigma different from the directly simulated AMOC over the more recent decades. As only two models with unrealistic warming failed the test, the relationship or emergent constraint proposed here seems indeed to be robust but may lead to a small bias towards too negative AMOC anomalies from around 1990 to 2000. The reconstructed decadal averaged AMOC appears to be less variable than the simulated AMOC in climate models and hence less sensitive to external forcing such as aerosols or greenhouse gases. Over the last 60 years, the reconstructed AMOC shows neither a sign of the simulated increase in the AMOC in 15 out of the 24 climate models in the second half of the 20th century nor of the simulated decline in the AMOC after 2000 that is simulated in 20 out of 24 climate models (Fig.  8 ). The initial increase of the AMOC in the climate models has been shown to be driven by increasing aerosol concentrations 90 , 116 , 117 . The increase in aerosols in models has been shown to alter wind patterns in a way that evaporation over the North Atlantic increases, which results in increased sea surface salinity and density, and consequently in stronger deep-water formation and Atlantic overturning 90 , 116 , 117 , though this may also be a response to heat flux induced changes 91 . The later decline in the simulated AMOC across climate models, on the other hand, is caused by the warming of the North Atlantic ocean surface due to increasing greenhouse gases and a subsequent reduction in surface ocean density and deep-water formation 36 . The absence of such trends in the reconstructed AMOC indicates that the impact of aerosol and greenhouse gases are of a different strength than simulated in the climate models or that the AMOC is less sensitive to external forcing than previously thought 32 , 34 . The absence of the AMOC decrease in our reconstruction and the apparent robustness of the AMOC to external forcings is even more astonishing as meltwater fluxes from Greenland, which are not included in most climate models, are believed to also decrease the AMOC 32 , albeit likely by a limited amount so far 115 . This apparent robustness of the AMOC over the recent decades raises the question if the projected AMOC decline across the CMIP6 model ensemble over the 21st century 36  may be too large due to an AMOC that is too sensitive in these climate models 118 . In addition to air-sea heat flux anomalies, other variables such as net surface buoyancy fluxes that incorporate both heat and freshwater fluxes could be used to improve the reconstructions of the AMOC. Multi-variable constraints 22  using heat and freshwater fluxes separately could also lead to further improvements. Here, we have not used freshwater fluxes due to large uncertainty in precipitation minus evaporation over the open ocean 99 , and because the correlation between surface fluxes of heat and freshwater complicates the calibration of a multi-linear relationship using both of these flux products. Further research is needed to test if the addition of freshwater fluxes or salinity changes might further improve the reconstructed estimates of the AMOC anomaly. Proxy-based reconstructions of AMOC variability at 26.5°N over the past century have yielded a range of possible timeseries, some that show a decline, and some that do not. Two recent review papers have attempted to detect any coherence in these records by combining AMOC variability across a range of proxies 44 , 119 . Unfortunately, these reviews disagree with one another: Moffa-Sanchez et al.  119  use a wide range of available proxies across the North Atlantic and find no coherent variability, while Caesar et al.  44  use a subset of the available proxies that the authors deem to be most robust and find a reduced AMOC strength starting in either the second half of the 19th century or the 1960s. The disagreement between these reviews revolves around which proxies should be considered 63 , 120  and whether using more proxies is appropriate. Our reconstructions cannot disentangle this issue but we do see limited evidence of a peak in the AMOC prior to the 1960s (Fig.  8 ) as proposed in Caesar et al.  44 . Similarly, we see no evidence of a long-term decline in the AMOC since the second half of the nineteenth century (Fig.  8 ) as proposed by Caesar et al.  44 . Overall, our study shows that the North Atlantic air-sea heat flux anomaly tracks AMOC variability on decadal and longer timescales, and is more robust than the previously-proposed SST-based AMOC proxy 34 . Over the next decades, air-sea heat flux anomaly observations will thus provide a complementary way to observe AMOC changes in addition to existing direct observations at mooring arrays. The air-sea heat flux derived AMOC estimates are best suited to reconstruct AMOC variability in the subtropical North Atlantic, but also closely track the northward meridional heat transport in the subtropical and subpolar North Atlantic up to 50°N. The varying AMOC reconstructions at different latitudes also show that the AMOC is not a simple conveyor belt but strongly heterogeneous across latitudes 101 , 108 , 109 . Moreover, the new reconstructions of the AMOC strength over the last 60 years suggest that the AMOC is more stable than previously thought and that an AMOC decline has not occurred yet."

22,introduction,"Introduction Polar amplification, the phenomenon where polar regions experience more rapid surface warming compared to the global average, has been evident in the Arctic. Since satellite observations began in 1978-79, the summer Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) has decreased by approximately 50%, with a declining rate of about 13% per decade in September 1 . Arctic surface temperatures have warmed 2–4 times more than the global average 2 – 5 . In contrast, the Southern Ocean has warmed more slowly, and Antarctic SIE showed a slight increase over the past 40 years until around 2014 (refs.  6 – 8 ), although this was followed by rapid declines in 2015-16 and 2023-24 (refs.  9 , 10 ). This observational trend in Antarctic SIE has been a highly controversial issue, particularly because no single coupled climate model has successfully reproduced it. While this trend could fall within natural variability (e.g., ref.  11 ), several studies suggest it highlights deficiencies in climate models’ ability to simulate interactions between the Southern Ocean and Antarctic sea ice 12 , 13 . The pronounced warming difference between the Arctic and Antarctic has been cited as evidence that future polar amplification is expected to be more pronounced in the Arctic 14 – 17 . The net equatorward transport of oceanic heat over the southern high latitudes is likely to mitigate Southern Ocean warming and slow the loss of Antarctic sea ice 18 , 19 . Nevertheless, Antarctic SIE has been decreasing since 2016, reaching an exceptionally low levels during June-July-August (JJA) of 2023, unprecedented in the satellite record 9 , 10 . The recent decline in Antarctic SIE aligns with multi-model projections of a decline in Antarctic sea ice in the coming decades due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations 13 . The relative warming of the Southern Ocean compared to the Arctic Ocean could have far-reaching global impacts, particularly on regional tropical precipitation patterns. Climate models emphasize the role of hemispheric temperature gradients in shaping future ITCZ positioning 20 , 21 , highlighting the need to investigate the individual contributions of Arctic and Southern Ocean warming. While the influence of rapid Arctic Ocean warming on tropical precipitation has been extensively explored 22 – 24 , the impact of Southern Ocean warming is only now gaining attention 25 . Recent modeling studies indicate that the loss of Antarctic sea ice may contribute more to the rise in tropical surface temperatures than the loss of Arctic sea ice 26 , 27 . This may be partly explained by the sensitivity of the tropical southeastern Pacific SSTs to Southern Ocean surface warming, particularly through cloud-radiative feedback 28 , 29 . A CMIP6 multi-model statistical analysis suggests that future Antarctic sea ice loss could account for approximately 45% of the variation in future cross-equatorial SST gradient changes by the late 21st century, when normalized by the global warming effect 30 . These recent findings challenge the conventional belief that projected reductions in aerosol emissions 31  and continuing Arctic warming will cause a northward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the future 32 – 34 . Despite recent advances in understanding how Southern Ocean warming – particularly due to the decline in Antarctic sea ice – affects tropical climates, the relative significance of Southern Ocean versus Arctic warming remains uncertain. In this study, we utilize CMIP6 multi-model analysis in conjunction with SST nudging simulations to investigate the differential impacts of future surface warming in the Arctic and Southern Ocean on tropical climate projections by the mid-21st century. The focus on the mid-21st century (2046–2065) aims to provide practical insights into near-term climate changes. Our findings suggest that Southern Ocean warming may exert a more substantial influence on remote tropical climate systems, particularly in altering precipitation patterns and atmospheric circulation in the coming decades."
23,results,"Results Inter-model diversity in future Arctic and Southern Ocean warming Figure  1 a and b show historical and future projections of Arctic and Southern Ocean surface temperatures under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2-4.5 scenario (SSP2-4.5). This study focuses on the SSP2-4.5 medium-emission scenario, representing a ‘middle-of-the-road’ pathway 35 . Comparable analyses with the SSP5-8.5 scenario are provided in Supplementary Fig.  1 . In this context, the ‘Arctic Ocean’ refers to the pan-Arctic Ocean, defined as latitudes north of 60°N. Future changes in Arctic Ocean SST, denoted as ΔArctic-SST, exhibit a continuing upward trend from 1980 through the late 21st century (Fig.  1a ). From 1980 to 2100, the multi-model mean Arctic SST is projected to increase approximately 2 °C, with inter-model ΔArctic-SST ranging from 0.4 °C (CESM2) to 5 °C (CMCC-CM2-SR5) under SSP2-4.5. The suppressed pan-Arctic warming of CESM2 is attributed to significant Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) weakening 36 . The observed Arctic SST anomaly (red line in Fig.  1a ) closely aligns with the multi-model mean (thick black line in Fig.  1a ) from 1980 to the present.

( h, i, j ) Same as (e, f, g), but for rainfall changes (mm day -1 ). Composite patterns are calculated by subtracting the present-day climate (1995-2014 average) under the historical simulation from the future climate (2046-2065 average) under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. For the spatial composite fields, statistically significant values ( p  < 0.05) are indicated with stippling. Compared to Arctic sea surface warming, future Southern Ocean warming (ΔSouthern-SST) is relatively moderate (Fig.  1b ). The multi-model mean Southern Ocean SST (south of 50°S) is projected to increase by 1.1 °C from 1980 to 2100, though there is considerable variation among models. In several climate models, such as MIROC6 and CanESM5-CanOE, Southern Ocean SSTs show minimal increase by the end of the 21st century, while models like CIESM and CESM2-WACCM project increases of up to 2 °C. The observed Southern Ocean SST anomaly (red line in Fig.  1b ) indicates that SSTs have increased very little and even slightly decreased until the mid-2010s, placing this anomaly in the lower 5% of CMIP6 models. However, the rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice over the past two years suggests the beginning of accelerated Southern Ocean warming 37 , 38 . In general, CMIP6-simulated Arctic Ocean surface warming is approximately twice as large as Southern Ocean surface warming throughout the 21st century (compare Fig.  1 a and b). This difference is projected to increase the cross-equatorial SST gradient (Fig.  1c ). The cross-equatorial SST gradient (hereafter referred to as ‘Cross-SST’) is defined as the SST gradient between the northern tropics (0-25°N) and the southern tropics (0-25°S) (see Methods for details). A positive cross-equatorial SST gradient (Cross-SST > 0) indicates that SSTs in the northern tropical oceans are relatively higher than those in the southern tropical oceans. Figure  1c  illustrates that the multi-model mean change in the cross-equatorial SST gradient (ΔCross-SST) steadily increases from 1980 to the mid-21st century. Although the multi-model mean ΔCross-SST shows little change after the mid-21st century, individual models exhibit substantial variations. Future ΔCross-SST ranges from slightly negative (where the southern tropics are warmer than the northern tropics) in models like CIESM and CESM2-WACCM, to increases of up to around 1.2 °C in models like NorESM2-LM (refer to Fig.  2a,b ).

The cross-equatorial SST gradient is defined as the difference between the northern tropics (0-25°N) and southern tropics (0-25°S). Inter-model correlation coefficients (r, unitless) and p-values are shown in each figure, with dashed black lines indicating the regression slopes.  c, d  Same as (a, b), but for the cross-equatorial rainfall gradient (ΔCross-Precip, mm day -1  per °C).  e, f  Timeseries of the cross-equatorial SST gradient (°C) (e) and rainfall gradient (mm day -1 ) (f) for the warm Arctic Ocean group (red) and warm Southern Ocean group (blue) under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Shaded regions denote ±1 standard deviation across models. Future changes are calculated as the difference between the 2046-2065 average under the SSP2-4.5 scenario and the 1995-2014 average in the historical simulation. Consistent with previous studies, future increases in ΔCross-SST are accompanied by increased tropical rainfall in the Northern Hemisphere. Figure  1d  shows the multi-model evolution of the cross-equatorial precipitation change (ΔCross-Precip), defined as the precipitation gradient between the northern tropics (0–25°N) and the southern tropics (0–25°S). While the multi-model mean ΔCross-Precip shows a positive trend from 1980 to the mid-21st century, the substantial interannual variability of precipitation somewhat obscures the signal. Figure  1 e and f show composite SST anomaly maps depicting differences between the mid- 21st century (2046-2065 average) and the late 20th century (1995-2014 average). The top four models simulating the strongest Arctic warming and Southern Ocean warming are selected for the warm Arctic Ocean (Fig.  1e ) and warm Southern Ocean (Fig.  1f ) composites, respectively. While both the warm Arctic and warm Southern Ocean composites show mild El Niño-like SST warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific, this pattern is more pronounced in the warm Southern Ocean composite, consistent with ref.  39 . Zonal-mean SST anomalies indicate a positive cross-equatorial SST gradient in the strong Arctic Ocean warming composite (red line in Fig.  1g ) and a negative gradient in the strong Southern Ocean warming composite (blue line in Fig.  1g ). The warm Southern Ocean composite also reveals SST cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean (Fig.  1f ). This feature, often referred to as the ‘North Atlantic warming hole’ (NAWH), is frequently linked to a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), although other factors, such as teleconnections from the Indian Ocean 40 , 41  and wind-driven changes in the subpolar gyre 42 , may also contribute to its formation. While NAWH-like low SST anomalies are present in the warm Southern Ocean composite, these cold SST anomalies are not statistically significant (statistically significant SST anomalies are stippled in Fig.  1f ). Furthermore, the inter-model relationship between the magnitude of Southern Ocean warming and AMOC weakening is relatively weak (r = 0.22). Figure  1 h,  i  show composite precipitation anomalies. In the strong warm Arctic composite, precipitation increases over South Asia and off-equatorial North Africa but decreases over the tropical South Indian Ocean and off-equatorial South Pacific Ocean (Fig.  1h ). In the strong Southern Ocean composite, precipitation increases over the off-equatorial South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans (Fig.  1i ). The zonal-mean tropical precipitation anomaly shows that equatorial precipitation increases in both the warm Arctic and warm Southern Ocean composites due to global warming. A close examination reveals that precipitation in the off-equatorial Northern Hemisphere (5–8°N) increases by around 0.5 mm day -1 , indicating an intensification of the ITCZ in the warm Arctic Ocean composite (red line in Fig.  1j ). Recent studies indicate that the meridional width of the ITCZ narrows and strengthens in response to global warming 27 . Meanwhile, zonal-mean precipitation in the equatorial region (5°S–5°N) increases by around 0.4 mm day -1  in the warm Southern Ocean composite (blue line in Fig.  1j ), suggesting a slight southward shift of the ITCZ. Future increases in polar SSTs and cross-equatorial precipitation changes To what extent does inter-model diversity in Arctic and Southern Ocean SST warming correlate with cross-equatorial SST and precipitation gradients? Because future polar ocean warming is closely tied to the degree of global warming 5 , 43 , the increase in global-mean surface air temperature by the mid-21st century is well correlated with both Arctic and Southern Ocean SST increases (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). To exclude the effects of global warming, Arctic and Southern Ocean surface temperature changes are normalized by the degree of global-mean temperature changes (see Methods for details). After normalization, Arctic and Southern Ocean SST changes are expressed per °C of global warming. Figure  2 a,  b  illustrate the multi-model correlation coefficients between future Arctic and Southern Ocean warmings and the normalized future cross-equatorial SST gradient. The correlation between ΔArctic-SST and ΔCross-SST is low (r = 0.14; Fig.  2a ), while the correlation between ΔSouthern-SST and ΔCross-SST is strong and negative (r = −0.67; Fig.  2b ). This indicates that future Southern Ocean warming can significantly reduce the cross-equatorial SST gradient by enhancing southern tropical (0–25°S) SSTs more than northern tropical (0–25°N) SSTs. Changes in the interhemispheric SST gradient are associated with shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, influencing rainfall distribution across the equatorial region 33 , 34 . Similar to the cross-equatorial SST gradient, models with stronger Arctic warming tend to exhibit an increased cross-equatorial rainfall gradient (Fig.  2c ). The multi-model correlation coefficient between ΔArctic-SST and ΔCross-Precip is low (r = 0.15; Fig.  2c ). Conversely, models with greater Southern Ocean warming show a southward shift in the zonal-mean precipitation anomaly (Fig.  2d ). ΔSouthern-SST exhibits a relatively high negative correlation with ΔCross-Precip (r = −0.55; Fig.  2d ), explaining ~30% of the inter-model variability in the cross-equatorial rainfall gradient. When are these distinct cross-equatorial SST and precipitation gradients changes likely to occur? To address this question, we adopt a storyline approach 44 , 45 . Climate model groups simulating strong Arctic Ocean warming and strong Southern Ocean warming by the late 21st century show that notable differences in ΔCross-SST and ΔCross-Precip between these two groups begin to emerge around 2040 (Fig.  2 e,  f ). In the warm Arctic Ocean models (CMCC-CM2-SR5, CMCC-ESM2, MIROC6, and CanESM5 models), ΔCross-SST and ΔCross-Precip exhibit distinct northward migration starting around 2030 and continuously amplify by the late 21st century (red lines in Fig.  2 e,  f ). In contrast, in the warm Southern Ocean models (CESM2, CESM2-WACCM, CIESM, and CNRM-CM6-1-HR models), ΔCross-SST and ΔCross-Precip remain relatively unchanged until around 2070 and then shift slightly southward by 2080. These findings suggest that significant Southern Ocean warming will lead to minimal changes in cross-equatorial precipitation (ΔCross-Precip ≈ 0) by the mid-21st century. This challenges the prevailing belief that differential heating between the hemispheres under global warming will likely shift zonal-mean tropical precipitation northward 23 – 25 . Tropical Atlantic rainfall changes Due to the strong meridional rainfall gradient across the climatological ITCZ, its displacement can lead to droughts and floods in neighboring countries 46 . In the tropical Atlantic, the movement of the rainfall band induces a dipole precipitation pattern between the West African monsoon region and northeastern Brazil (Fig.  3 ). Here, we focus on the Sahel and northeastern Brazil, two tropical regions highly vulnerable to high latitude climate changes 22 , 47 , 48 . Fig. 3 Inter-model relationship between polar ocean Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and regional rainfall. Composites of rainfall changes (% per °C) in ( a ) warm Arctic Ocean models, ( b ) warm Southern Ocean models. The blue box denotes northeastern Brazil and the red box indicates the Sahel region.  c  Inter-model relationship between changes in Arctic Ocean SST (°C per °C) and Sahel rainfall (% per °C).  d  Same as (c), but for Southern Ocean SST (°C per °C).  e  Same as (c), but for northeastern Brazil rainfall (% per °C).  f  Same as (d), but for northeastern Brazil rainfall (% per °C). Inter-model correlation coefficients (r, unitless) and  p -values are shown in each figure, with dashed black lines indicating the regression slopes. Here, future changes are calculated as the difference between the future climate (2046-2065 average) in the SSP2-4.5 scenario and the present-day climate (1995-2014 average) in the historical simulation. Normalization is based on the corresponding changes in global mean surface air temperature. For the spatial composite fields, statistically significant values ( p  < 0.05) are indicated with stippling. Figure  3 a,  b  show the composite rainfall anomalies for the warm Arctic model group and the warm Southern Ocean group, respectively. Future precipitation changes are normalized by the global-mean surface temperature increases, resulting in units of fractional precipitation changes per °C of global warming. Consistent with previous studies 22 , 48 , anomalously high SSTs in the Arctic are associated with a noticeable increase in annual-mean precipitation over the Sahel region (Fig.  3a ). Conversely, in the warm Southern Ocean model group, precipitation over the Sahel decreases by approximately 10% per 1.0 °C of global warming (Fig.  3b ). The multi-model correlation between ΔArctic-SST and precipitation changes in the Sahel region is 0.57 (Fig.  3c ), indicating a strong connection between the degree of future Arctic warming and Sahel precipitation. In contrast, the correlation between Southern Ocean SST changes (ΔSouthern-SST) and precipitation changes in the Sahel is weakly negative, with a correlation coefficient of −0.25 (Fig.  3d ). In the off-equatorial South Atlantic region, rainfall changes in northeastern Brazil (central-eastern Amazon) are more strongly correlated with Southern Ocean warming than with Arctic Ocean warming (Fig.  3e, f ). The multi-model correlation between ΔSouthern-SST and precipitation changes in northeastern Brazil is 0.49 (Fig.  3f ), accounting for 24% of the inter-model variances. In contrast, the connection between ΔArctic-SST and precipitation changes in northeastern Brazil is weak, with a correlation coefficient of -0.30 (Fig.  3e ), which is marginally significant ( p  = 0.05). These multi-model correlations suggest that Southern Ocean warming can increase the chance of precipitation increases over northeastern Brazil. Would other global warming scenarios produce similar impacts on regional precipitation changes? To explore this, the same analysis is applied to other scenarios – SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 – with the results summarized in Supplementary Fig.  3 . Across all scenarios, the warm Arctic Ocean group generally exhibits increased Sahel rainfall, whereas the warm Southern Ocean group shows a reduction in Sahel rainfall. This pattern is mostly pronounced under SSP1-2.6 and gradually weakens toward SSP5-8.5. In SSP1-2.6, the correlation between ΔSouthern-SST and Sahel precipitation change is statistically significant, with a correlation coefficient of −0.41. The sensitivity to scenario suggests that future Southern Ocean surface warming is more effective at inducing Sahel drought under low-emission scenarios, whereas under medium- or high-emission scenarios, the response is more driven by global warming. Another key factor contributing to the southward shift of the tropical Atlantic ITCZ is the projected weakening of the AMOC and formation of the NAWH 48 , 49 . Supplementary Fig.  4  shows that the multi-model correlations between Southern Ocean warming and AMOC weakening, as well as with the NAWH, by the mid-21st century are weak (r = 0.22 and r = −0.18, respectively). The Atlantic sector rainfall anomalies in CMIP6 models with significant AMOC weakening by the mid-21st century show reduced rainfall over the off-equatorial North Atlantic Ocean and northern Africa, with this pattern slightly more amplified in the strong NAWH composite. This precipitation anomaly pattern associated with the strong NAWH composite resembles that caused by strong Southern Ocean warming. However, while the patterns are similar, Atlantic sector-mean latitudinal precipitation anomalies indicate that cross-equatorial precipitation anomalies are slightly more pronounced in the warm Southern Ocean model group than in the strong NAWH model group (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). SST nudging simulations: testing the effects of polar ocean warming on tropical climate Composite analyses of CMIP6 models highlight the potential influence of Arctic and Southern Ocean warming on future tropical climate patterns. To verify these effects and to better understand the underlying physical processes, we conducted a series of sensitivity experiments using Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). In these experiments, SSTs in the Arctic and Southern Ocean were restored (nudged) to specified values. We selected CESM2 because it successfully simulates an enhanced zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific and a strengthening of Pacific trade winds from 1980 to 2010, in response to human-induced stratospheric ozone depletion and/or aerosol changes 50 . Figure  4 a and b illustrate the global SST responses to warming in the Arctic (north of 57°N) and Southern Ocean (south of 52°S), respectively. Since SSTs increase gradually over 100 years in CMIP6 SSP scenario simulations, we incrementally increased SSTs in the polar oceans over 100 years (see Methods). The global SST responses show that warming in the Arctic and Southern Ocean effectively increases temperature in the off-equatorial Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively (Fig.  4 a and b). These temperature changes lead to modifications in ΔCross-SST, which are clearly evident in the zonal-mean SST anomalies (Fig.  4c ). These findings suggest that the interhemispheric SST gradient contrasts observed in the CMIP6 composites of the warm Arctic Ocean and warm Southern Ocean model groups (Fig.  1 e,  f ) can be partially driven by Arctic and Southern Ocean surface warming, respectively. Fig. 4 Tropical climate changes caused by polar ocean warming in the idealized Sea Surface Temperature (SST) nudging simulations. SST changes (°C) in ( a ) warm Arctic Ocean simulation, ( b ) warm Southern Ocean simulation, ( c ) zonal-mean SST (°C) changes in warm Arctic (red) and Southern Ocean simulations (blue).  d, e, f  Same as (a, b, c), but for rainfall changes (mm day -1 ). The analysis period is from years 41 to 60 of the 100-years simulation. Statistically significant values ( p  < 0.05) are indicated with stippling. A close examination of Fig.  4 a,  b  reveals that the impact of Southern Ocean warming on global SSTs is more pronounced than that of Arctic Ocean warming. Specifically, Southern Ocean warming not only affects SSTs in the Southern Hemisphere but also induces a positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)-like SST pattern in the North Pacific Ocean (Fig.  4b ). This is consistent with recent modeling studies suggesting that Southern Ocean surface warming, particularly due to the loss of Antarctic sea ice, can deepen the Aleutian Low and drive positive PDO-like SST anomalies in the North Pacific 26 . Conversely, Southern Ocean cooling is shown to drive Aleutian low weakening and North Pacific warming 25 . Moreover, the Southern Ocean warming experiment shows an El Niño-like SST pattern and an associated Atlantic Niño (Fig.  4b ), which are not clearly simulated by the Arctic Ocean warming experiment (Fig.  4a ). Instead, the tropical SST response to Arctic Ocean warming (Fig.  4a ) reveals a somewhat weak La Niña-like SST pattern. In the final 20 years of the 100-year SST nudging experiment, this La Niña-like pattern diminishes (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). This outcome contrasts somewhat with the CMIP6 ‘warm Arctic SST’ composite (Fig.  1e ), which shows a weak El Niño-like SST warming pattern. This difference likely arises because the SST nudging experiment isolates the effects of Arctic Ocean warming alone, whereas the CMIP6 warm Arctic Ocean composite includes both Arctic Ocean warming and the effects of greenhouse gas-induced global warming. Additionally, differences may also stem from both internal variability, model diversity, and the timescale of perturbations 51 . In response to the cross-equatorial SST gradient, the zonal-mean cross-equatorial precipitation changes accordingly (Fig.  4d–f ). The Southern Ocean warming experiment shows an increase in precipitation in the off-equatorial Southern Hemisphere and a corresponding decrease in the off-equatorial Northern Hemisphere (Fig.  4e ). This pattern aligns with the findings from recent modeling studies 26 , 27 , which investigated the effects of reduced Antarctic sea ice cover. The zonal-mean precipitation anomalies show that Southern Ocean warming increases precipitation by up to 150 mm yr − ¹ in the 5°S–10°S range (blue line in Fig.  4f ), while a similar reduction in annual precipitation occurs in the off-equatorial Northern Hemisphere. Similarly, in the Arctic Ocean warming experiment, the opposite pattern emerges, with a comparable magnitude of annual-mean precipitation anomalies (red line in Fig.  4f ). Given that the zonal-mean climatological precipitation in the off-equatorial regions is around 1500–1800 mm yr − 1 , an increase of up to 150 mm yr − 1  in 5°S–10°S implies an 8–10% increase in response to the Southern Ocean surface warming. This aligns with CMIP6 results (Fig.  1h–j ), as both show maximum rainfall anomalies in the off-equatorial Southern Hemisphere for Southern Ocean warming and in the Northern Hemisphere for Arctic warming. Over the tropical Atlantic region, the Arctic Ocean warming can effectively decrease precipitation over northeastern Brazil by about 400 mm yr -1  (Fig.  4d ). Although the CMIP6 multi-model correlation between Arctic Ocean warming and precipitation over northeastern Brazil is weak (Fig.  3e ), our idealized SST nudging simulations suggest that future Arctic warming could potentially increase drought risk in northeastern Brazil. More detailed teleconnection processes explaining how Southern Ocean warming at high latitudes (50°-80°S) increases SSTs in lower latitudes are illustrated in Fig.  5 . In response to Southern Ocean warming, sea level pressure (SLP) decreases across broad areas of the southern mid-latitudes and subtropics (10°-60°S; Fig.  5b ). These low SLP anomalies induce anomalous cyclonic circulation in the southern subtropics, along with cross-equatorial flows anomalies over the eastern equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (vectors in Fig.  5b ), which play a key role in shifting the ITCZ southward. The surface wind anomalies oppose the climatological winds (compare Fig.  5 a,  b ), indicating a weakening of the prevailing wind patterns, particularly the trade winds.

This downward-directed flux reinforces regional SST warming over the southern subtropics, the tropical Indo-Pacific near the Maritime Continent, and the eastern tropical Pacific cold tongue. To further quantify the effects of Arctic and Southern Ocean warming on the tropical climate, additional idealized SST nudging simulations were conducted. In these simulations, SST anomalies were gradually increased from 0 °C to 4 °C in both the Arctic and Southern Oceans (see Methods). Figure  6 a,  b  illustrate the sensitivities of ΔCross-SST to Arctic and Southern Ocean warmings, respectively. The regression slope of ΔCross-SST to Southern Ocean warming is twice as steep as that to Arctic Ocean warming. Specifically, for each 1 °C increase in Arctic Ocean SST, ΔCross-SST rises by approximately 0.09 °C, and ΔCross-Precip increases by about 0.11 mm day − 1  (Fig.  6a, c ). In contrast, for each 1 °C increase in Southern Ocean SST, ΔCross-SST decreases by approximately 0.18 °C, and ΔCross-Precip declines by about 0.17 mm day − 1  (Fig.  6b, d ).

Regression coefficients are also denoted in each figure, with black dashed line indicating regression slope. Note that the y-axis interval is the same between (a) and (b), and between (c) and (d). The main findings from these CESM2-based SST nudging simulations align well with the CMIP6 multi-model relationship (compare Figs.  2 ,  6 ). In CMIP6, the sensitivity of ΔCross-Precip to Southern Ocean warming is approximately 50% higher than to Arctic Ocean warming. Specifically, ΔCross-Precip increases by 0.11 mm day -1  per 1 °C increase in Arctic Ocean SST (Fig.  2c ), while it decreases by −0.17 mm day -1  per 1 °C increase in Southern Ocean SST (Fig.  2d ). This agreement highlights the robustness of the simulated relationship between polar SST changes and tropical precipitation responses across different modeling frameworks. If the rapid loss of Antarctic sea ice persists, the relatively moderate surface warming of the Southern Ocean – compared to the Arctic – could still have a substantial impact on tropical climates due to its higher effectiveness per degree of warming."
24,discussion,"Discussion This study underscores the significant influence of Southern Ocean warming on future tropical climate patterns, suggesting it may exert a greater impact than Arctic warming. Our multi-model analysis and SST nudging experiments suggest that Southern Ocean warming, even at 60-70% of the level of Arctic Ocean warming, could counteract the anticipated northward shift of zonal-mean precipitation in the tropics caused by Arctic Ocean warming and greenhouse gas-induced global warming. Notably, our idealized SST nudging experiments indicate that a 1.0 °C rise in Southern Ocean temperatures might influence tropical precipitation patterns as much as a 1.5 °C rise in Arctic temperatures. The regional implications of Southern Ocean warming are particularly striking. Our findings indicate that Southern Ocean warming could lead to an increase in rainfall in northeastern Brazil while simultaneously exacerbating drought conditions in the Sahel region. A limitation of our study is the inability to isolate the effect of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, which could significantly influence temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere. Aerosols were a major factor contributing to suppressed surface warming in the Northern Hemisphere during the late 20th century 52 , 53 . As aerosol forcing is expected to diminish in future climate change scenarios 54 , climate models that are more sensitive to aerosols in the historical era may project stronger Northern Hemisphere warming 55 , 56 . Another limitation is that our idealized model simulations are based on a single climate model, CESM2, which exhibits a larger southward shift of the ITCZ in response to global warming compared to the CMIP6 multi-model average. Further studies using a broader range of climate models are necessary to validate these findings and evaluate potential variations in model responses. In conclusion, using a storyline approach, we find that Southern Ocean warming, strongly tied to Antarctic sea ice loss, is likely to play a pivotal role in shaping tropical SST patterns and altering regional hydrological cycles in the coming decades. A concurrent weakening of the AMOC and the development of the NAWH, which may constrain Northern high-latitude warming 36 , 57 , represents one plausible storyline. This scenario could trigger an abrupt southward shift of the ITCZ and significant regional precipitation changes."

26,introduction,"Introduction Human activities have led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, with approximately 30% of this being absorbed by the ocean in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 1 . The ocean system is therefore an important buffer against anthropogenic CO 2  emissions 1 , 2 . Naturally, a better understanding of the ocean carbon cycle is crucial for a reliable projection of atmospheric CO 2  concentration under global warming. Earth System Models (ESMs) currently project that most of the ocean CO 2  uptake would increase linearly in response to rising atmospheric CO 2  levels, slowing towards the end of the simulation 3 – 5 . Interestingly, depending on the ocean basin, the CO 2  uptake shows a different response. In both the Tropical and Southern Oceans, the uptake is particularly enhanced, with these regions expected to become more favorable for CO 2  absorption due to changes in upwelling and sea ice 6 – 8 . In the North Atlantic Ocean (NA), previous studies suggest that the CO 2  uptake may follow a distinct temporal evolution under global warming 8 – 13 . Therefore, as not all oceans respond in the same way, this highlights the need to focus on regions with unique characteristics. The NA is currently known for its efficient CO 2  uptake, covering only 15% of the global ocean area while holding more than 23% of the global oceanic anthropogenic CO 2 14 . This efficiency is closely linked to deep-water formation, facilitated by the cold and dense environment in the Subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) 14 , 15 ; excessive CO 2  can be delivered into the deep ocean through the descending branch of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) 14 , 16 – 18 . Under greenhouse warming, changes in the AMOC naturally raise a potential loss of the effective CO 2  uptake, which is indeed reported when the permanent collapse of the AMOC occurs 8 , 9 , 11 – 13 . For example, a recent modeling experiment suggests that the permanent collapse of the AMOC would diminish the NA CO 2  uptake around the 22nd century 8 . Since such a permanent collapse is not projected to occur within 2100 in most of state-of-the-art ESMs 19 , one may reasonably expect that the SPNA will continue to serve as an effective sink for atmospheric CO 2 . However, there remains the potential loss of the CO 2  uptake efficiency in the SPNA under global warming scenarios. The deep convection around the SPNA, particularly Labrador- Irminger Seas (hereafter Lab-Irm), and the regional carbon cycle are also tightly connected to the subpolar gyre (SPG) 15 , 20 . Intense SPG maintains deep MLD through increased convection, while a weakened SPG suppresses the development of the active mixed layer 21 . While global warming weakens both the SPG and the AMOC 22 – 24 , the collapse of SPG cannot be regarded as identical to that of the collapse of the AMOC, particularly as their temporal evolutions may differ significantly 21 , 25 . Therefore, interpreting the SPNA CO 2  uptake solely as a passive response to AMOC may be a limited perspective. Consequently, there is the possibility of losing uptake efficiency triggered by abrupt changes in regional ocean dynamics, and this possibility remains largely unexplored. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate changes in the SPNA CO 2  uptake and local deep convection, with a particular focus on assessing potential nonlinear responses in CO₂ uptake. Using a fully coupled Earth System Model (ESM) with varying CO 2  emission rates, we reveal that the anomalous CO 2  outgassing emerges with a distinct spatial pattern confined to the SPNA. Under greenhouse warming, the SPNA experiences unusual cooling—a phenomenon not observed in other regions—leading to the term “warming hole”﻿ 26 . In this context, we propose that the reversed CO 2  flux exhibits similar unusual characteristics, with pronounced anomalous outgassing in the SPNA, while other regions continue to absorb more CO 2 . Drawing an analogy to the “North Atlantic warming hole”, we refer to this phenomenon as the “CO 2  uptake hole”. Here, we show that the timing of the uptake hole occurrence coincides with the collapse of local deep convection, which could appear on relatively short time scales without substantial AMOC weakening."
27,results,"Results Ocean carbon cycle changes under the warming scenario As the anthropogenic emission rate increases (Fig.  1a ), the atmospheric CO 2  concentration exponentially increases in each scenario, reaching approximately 1400 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 960 ppm at the end of the corresponding experiments (Fig.  1b ). The global air-sea CO 2  flux significantly uptakes the surplus atmospheric CO 2 . Thereby it absorbs a 3.5 PgC yr –1 , 2.5 PgC yr –1 , and 2 PgC yr –1  in ER1.5, ER1.0, and ER0.5, respectively, and reaches a quasi-steady state (Fig.  1d ). This is mainly caused by decreasing the buffer capacity of the carbonate system—the efficiency of ocean CO 2  absorption—due to change of multiple physical and chemical processes as anthropogenic CO 2  dissolves into the ocean 8 , 27 , 28 . We further examine the spatial pattern of annual mean air-sea CO 2  flux change in the last 20 years (years 2081–2100) relative to the initial 10 years (years 2001-2010) of ER1.5 (Fig.  1c ). In line with previous studies, the global CO 2  uptake is largely influenced by the Southern Ocean and tropics. In the Southern Ocean, turbulent exchange is expected to accelerate as sea ice cover decreases and westerly wind strengthens, while a weakening of the equatorial trade wind is followed by a weakening of the equatorial upwelling 8 . Both responses tend to provide fertile conditions to absorb the atmospheric CO 2 . Temporal evolutions of CO 2  uptake changes in these regions well resemble that of the global ocean (comparing Fig.  1d  and Supplementary Fig.  1c–d ).

The dashed lines in panel ( e ) show the rebound timing defined by the maximum CO 2  absorption peak times, which is the highest trend of the air-sea CO 2  flux with smoothing 11 years since 2001, included in all ensembles in the ER experiments. Negative (positive) air-sea CO 2  flux indicates oceanic CO 2  uptake (outgassing). 7 ensembles are conducted for each scenario with slightly different initial conditions (see “Methods”).

				\begin{document}$$(\pm 1{s}.d)$$\end{document} ( ± 1 s . d ) . The time series are smoothed with an 11-year running mean. The SPNA, however, exhibits strong positive air-sea CO 2  flux changes, indicating reduced CO 2  uptake into the ocean relative to the initial 10 years (years 2001-2010, red box in Fig.  1c ), which is consistently shown in different emission rate scenarios (i.e., ER0.5 and ER1.0; Supplementary Fig.  1a–b ). The peak absorption is reached at 0.1 Pg C yr –1 , 0.05 Pg C yr –1 , and 0.03 Pg C yr –1  by the years 2040, 2053, and 2075, denoted as the rebound time, which is the average of the maximum CO 2  uptake peak times for each ensemble in the SPNA (vertical dashed line in Fig.  1e ). From the rebound times, the SPNA begins to decrease the air-sea CO 2  flux changes, thereby generating pronounced anomalous outgassing over the SPNA. It is already well known that the SPNA exhibits a distinct phenomenon compared to other regions, referred to as the “warming hole” 26 , which may also be manifested in the carbon cycle. Although the spatial patterns of the two features are not identical, we suggest referring to this significantly anomalous outgassing phenomenon as the “CO 2  uptake hole”, drawing an analogy to the “warming hole”. Note that previous studies have already mentioned the possibility of the uptake hole phenomenon 8 – 12 . However, our results imply that its time scale could be much faster even without the AMOC collapse (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Furthermore, to assess the robustness of the uptake hole beyond the ER experiments, we extend our analysis using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) (Methods). Regardless of the emission rates, the CMIP6 multi-model mean (MMM) shows similar features to the SPNA CO 2  flux changes, although considerable uncertainty remains (Fig.  1e ). The SPNA MLD, linked to the deep-water formation, exhibits significant intermodel spread 29  (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), contributing to considerable uncertainty, akin to the spread observed in the AMOC 30 , 31 . To underpin the robustness, we make a time-lag composite of SPNA air-sea CO 2  flux based on the rebound time (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The composite analysis is referenced to lag 0, corresponding to the timing of the local maximum CO 2  uptake in each model. Notably, most models simulate this rebound feature, where the CO 2  flux initially increases before subsequently decreasing. The result highlights that the CMIP6 MMM projects a reversed CO 2  uptake trend, which is highly consistent with the ER experiments (comparing gray and colored thick lines in Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Furthermore, if we only select the models that closely simulate the observed MLD and CO 2  flux (see “Methods”), the proposed rebound feature is much clearer (blue line in Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The spatial pattern of anomalous CO 2  flux in the SPNA is also similar between CMIP6 MMM and ER1.5 (pattern correlation = 0.74) (Fig.  1c  and Supplementary Fig.  5 ), which is also valid for the best models (pattern correlation = 0.81). It should be noted that other ER models and CMIP6 MMM also have high pattern correlation values in excess of 0.7. Thus, the results indicate that, in spite of the uncertainties, the CMIP6 generally shares a similar feature of the “CO 2  uptake hole”. Across different forcing scenarios and model frameworks, this points to the robustness of the CO 2  uptake response to greenhouse warming. Therefore, we focus on understanding a different role of the SPNA region in CO 2  uptake compared to the other oceans across all three global warming experiments.

It clearly shows that CO 2  accumulates at the ocean surface much faster than in the atmosphere, pointing the need to understand the underlying physical dynamics. Underlying mechanisms of the air-sea CO₂ flux reversal The DIC accumulation in the SPNA at a rate exceeding its sources implies the presence of unique processes, with the AMOC being an intuitive candidate. The AMOC is continuously weakening under greenhouse warming (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), contributing to the regional DIC accumulation as the DIC-poor water in the subtropics is less transported 36 – 39 . Current understanding suggests that SPNA CO 2  uptake is likely to decline as the AMOC weakens and even collapses in future climate scenarios 8 – 11 . We further examine the CO 2  flux response to the AMOC changes, which exhibits a nonlinear relationship in both the ER experiments and the CMIP6 MMM (Fig.  3a ). The nonlinear relationship suggests that the CO 2  uptake hole appears when the AMOC reaches a certain threshold. At the local minimum of the air-sea CO 2  flux, the AMOC strength is about 15 Sv for ER experiments and 13 Sv for CMIP6 MMM. While there is intermodel spread in AMOC strength itself, the threshold is still highly distant from the permanent collapse 8 , 40 , reflecting an indirect role of AMOC in regulating the CO 2  uptake hole and indicating the possibility of CO 2  uptake hole prior to the permanent collapse. Accordingly, we need to invoke another process more responsible for the nonlinear CO 2  uptake: the collapse of deep convection in the Lab-Irm.

The SPNA is one of the main regions where deep convection is observed in the Northern Hemisphere 41 – 44  (Supplementary Fig.  3a ), and the employed model also simulates the climatological MLD in the Lab-Irm extending beyond 1000 m, active deep convection (black contour line in Supplementary Fig.  3b ). MLD across the entire SPNA region exhibits a decrease under greenhouse warming. Interestingly, the Lab-Irm MLD—a footprint of deep convection—continues to decrease until it approaches about 200 m and stays afterward, which can be considered as the shutdown of the Lab-Irm deep convection (black line in Fig.  4a  and Supplementary Fig.  7a–b ). The CMIP6 MMM also shows a marked reduction in deep convection, nearly vanishing at a depth of approximately 200 m, a phenomenon even more distinctly captured by the best models (black line in Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Fig.  7c ). Recent studies have distinguished the shutdown of the Lab-Irm MLD from that of the AMOC, indicating that they are not the same phenomena. The regional contraction affects the AMOC but does not completely disrupt it 21 , 25 . Consistently, although the AMOC still takes a substantial role in the long-term adjustment of the climate system, the Lab-Irm MLD collapses on a much shorter time scale, initiating dynamic feedback to halt the deep CO 2  transport and uptake there (Fig.  4a, b  and Supplementary Fig.  7 ).

DIC is normalized by salinity (the standard salinity is 35 psu).  c  Scatter plot between the timing in the Lab-Irm MLD shutdown versus the SPNA air-sea CO 2  flux rebound time. The MLD shutdown indicates when it becomes shallower than 200 m. The air-sea CO 2  flux rebound is measured by the average of the maximum CO 2  uptake peak times for each model. * mark indicates statistically significant correlation at the 95% confidence level. The local DIC accumulation upon the upper ocean is evident in the Hovmöller diagram of the vertical DIC deviations over the SPNA (Fig.  4a, b  and Supplementary Fig.  7 ). For more detail, at the beginning of the experiments, the deep ocean exhibits significantly higher DIC concentration compared to the surface. This leads to effective surface-to-deep transport, despite the gradual decrease of the MLD. However, as the collapse gets closer, DIC accumulates explosively in the upper ocean (0–200 m) because there is no longer active mixing between the upper and deeper ocean. Consistently, the CMIP6 MMM also shows increased DIC accumulation in the surface layer as the MLD approaches 200 m, with this feature being clearer in the best models (Fig.  4b  and Supplementary Fig.  7c ). Hence, the Lab-Irm MLD collapse evidently acts as a positive feedback which amplifies a surface DIC accumulation over the SPNA. This mechanism ultimately has a direct impact on the CO 2  uptake. It might not be surprising that the convection collapse is affected by the emission rates; however, it is quite striking that the collapse consistently aligns with the rebound of the air-sea CO 2  flux, regardless of the emission rates (Fig.  1e ). Therefore, in both the ER experiments and the CMIP6, the SPNA CO 2  uptake is weakened as the Lab-Irm MLD begins to collapse, highlighting the importance of the proposed dynamical feedback (Fig.  3b ). Potential indicators of the uptake hole emergence The surface DIC concentration that induces the CO 2  uptake reversal also shows a nonlinear relationship with a local minimum around 2200–2250 mmol m –3  (Fig.  3c ). After the minimum, the air-sea CO 2  flux starts to decline despite continuous DIC increases. Therefore, the minimum serves as a threshold at which the uptake hole emerges. Overall, the chemical environment (i.e., DIC) is accompanied by regional ocean dynamics (i.e., MLD) and large-scale dynamics (i.e., AMOC), which together establish the nonlinear relationship with the CO₂ uptake hole in the SPNA (Fig.  3 ). Although individual models exhibit varying threshold points over time due to differences in rebound timing of the CO 2  flux (Supplementary Fig.  4 ), our finding is that all three indicators show a similar threshold leading to CO 2  reversal within a reliable timeframe—particularly compared in the CMIP6 MMM and ER experiments—suggesting that the emergence of a CO 2  uptake hole would not be unavoidable (comparing vertical lines and color transitions in Fig.  3 ). We could utilize these relationships to assess the potential emergence of the uptake hole under climate change scenarios projected by current climate models. By comparing modeled thresholds with present-day observations, we estimate the remaining distance to the onset of the uptake hole. Examining the recent climatology obtained from the RAPID array and reanalysis data (SODA, ECCO, ORAS5 and the OceanSODA-ETHZ): about 17 Sv, 800 m, 2230 mmol m –3  (vertical lines in Fig.  3 ) may provide valuable insights for predicting anomalous outgassing in the SPNA. While we refrain from overemphasizing the thresholds in determining exact timing, it is highly plausible that the uptake hole’s emergence will occur on a shorter timescale than the anticipated AMOC collapse. So far, the analyses have only focused on the temporal evolution in terms of the multi-model mean, raising a query of its credibility in the context of inter-model spread. We hence compare the timing of the SPNA CO₂ flux rebound to the local minimum and the MLD shutdown to approximately 200 m (Fig.  4c ). Despite the existence of models that do not simulate the Lab-Irm MLD (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), the inter-model relationship depicts a linear relationship (r = 0.53,  p  value < 0.05). This suggests that, in difference to the previous finding that the loss of CO₂ uptake capacity in the SPNA is associated with the collapse of the AMOC, regional deep convection act as a direct modulator of CO₂ capacity regulation in the SPNA."

Although the ocean usually plays an important role as a reservoir for absorbing anthropogenic CO 2 , the SPNA weakens the ability to sequester CO 2  much faster than other regions.

This phenomenon is not solely driven by the global increase in atmospheric CO 2 , suggesting the presence of a unique process contributing to DIC accumulation in the SPNA. We find that the rebound of the CO 2  flux temporally coincides with the contraction of Lab-Irm deep convection both in all ER experiments and CMIP6 multi-model mean. The convection contraction is accompanied by the local DIC saturation, which makes it difficult for the environment to absorb more CO 2 —making the CO 2  uptake hole. Hence, the SPNA carbon cycle change mechanisms associated with the MLD shutdown are elucidated, occurring on a shorter timescale than the AMOC collapse that typically spans hundreds of years 45 . It is important to point out that the threshold behavior for CO 2  uptake holes appears to be independent of emission rates and model configuration. This highlights that, despite the complexity of the NA environment, the uptake hole is a reliable phenomenon. Finding the thresholds could serve as a potential indicator, focusing on the AMOC, MLD, and surface DIC. The air-sea CO 2  flux reversal is apparent through each critical value around 2250 mmol m –3  of the surface DIC, 15 Sv of the AMOC, and 800 m of the Lab-Irm MLD. Specifically, applying these criteria to current observations provides insight into the ongoing state of the climate system and cautions that the emergence of the uptake hole may be unavoidable. Recent studies have aimed to reduce the uncertainty in the NA future projections by applying an emergent constraint approach. Park et al. 46  found that the amount of future cumulative CO 2  inventory depends on the sea surface salinity (SSS) in the present climate. High present-day SSS models predict increased CO 2  accumulation in the SPNA. From the climatological perspective of the models, the stronger mixing may exhibit a higher CO 2  storage capacity. While not directly matched with our findings, a substantial initial CO 2  cumulative content inheres the potential uptake hole existence with faster CO 2  saturation in the future. Rather, Goris et al. 20  directly examined the tendency change of CO 2  uptake. They proposed that models with realistic NA simulation, stronger winter Lab-Irm mixing, and CO 2  uptake in the NA, tend to commence the limited CO 2  storage before the end of the 21 st  century due to the vanished mixing (i.e., CO 2  flux tendency disappears). Reconciling our findings, the flattened CO 2  storage could be understood as the onset of the uptake hole. Current climate models project that the NA will undergo substantial changes in the future, driven by the slowdown of the AMOC and the contraction of convection. However, recent studies have suggested that models still simulate too stable circulation 45 . Considering the observational signals warning that the AMOC is approaching the unstable regime, there is a possibility that we experience a more severe and abrupt collapse of the AMOC 40 , 47 – 49 . Current models showed that Lab-Irm MLD cessation triggers a sudden alteration in the carbon cycle, even amid the gradual AMOC decline. Without the abrupt transition, the AMOC evolution is extremely complex as it can be modulated by several factors such as aerosols 50 , meltwater fluxes 51 – 53 , and Indian ocean warming 54 . Therefore, ongoing observations should be kept concentrated to comprehensively capture the current carbon cycle dynamics and carefully consider for potential existence of the CO 2  uptake hole and its ensuing impacts. The results of our study can be considered as one of the candidates for advancing regional carbon mitigation strategies. Several studies on ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) as one of the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods are presented, evaluating the effectiveness of OAE through various experimental approaches 55 – 58 . Based on regional sensitivity to OAE, the NA deep convection region has been considered unsuitable due to the rapid loss of added alkalinity to the deep ocean, leading to the lowest efficiency in cumulative DIC storage 56 , 57 . However, our findings suggest that changes in the deep convection could potentially make the NA a more effective region for OAE. This means that changes in regional dynamics have a double-edged effect, and it is essential to continually assess how to manage them under global warming."

30,introduction,"Introduction Ice sheets wax and wane over the course of glacial-interglacial cycles, interacting with Earth’s fluid (atmosphere and ocean) and solid (lithosphere and asthenosphere) shells in a variety of ways. These interactions include positive feedbacks that amplify the response to external forcings and negative feedbacks that inhibit or slow responses to perturbations. Competing negative and positive ice-climate feedbacks associated with ice sheet growth and retreat are responsible for the sawtooth signature of Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles 1 , 2 . Freshwater discharge from disintegrating ice sheets during the deglaciation phase of glacial-interglacial cycles could be on the order of 1 Sv (10 6  m 3  s −1 ), equivalent to a rate of global-mean sea level rise (GMSLR) ~9 cm year −1 , and similar in magnitude to the present-day total global river discharge (~1.44 Sv 3 ). Climate feedbacks associated with ice sheet freshwater flux (FWF)—here referring to discharge in both liquid (meltwater from ice surface and base) and solid (icebergs calved from ice shelves) forms—have been proposed as a trigger mechanism for abrupt climate change events 4 . In present-day climate conditions, warm, salty surface waters flow northward in the Atlantic basin and are cooled in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic, forming deep waters that sink to depths and spread to the Southern Ocean, where they mix into the World Ocean 5 . This Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports heat across the equator to the North Atlantic and influences inter-hemispheric energy balance of the climate system. “Hosing” experiments, in which salinity fluxes are imposed on the ocean component of climate models to mimic ice sheet FWF, have demonstrated that ice sheet FWF stratifies the upper ocean and disturbs deep water formation, exerting global-scale climate impacts by changing the AMOC 5 – 9 . Ice sheet modeling under high-emission scenarios suggests the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) alone may provide a peak FWF to the Southern Ocean exceeding 1 Sv in the next century 10 , comparable to the Meltwater Pulse 1A of the Last Deglaciation 11 . Substantial climate impacts would be expected from ice sheet FWF on this scale, as evidenced by large climate disruptions during the Last Deglaciation coincident with ice sheet meltwater pulses, such as the Younger Dryas and the Antarctic Cold Reversal 12 . Nowadays ice sheet geometry and discharge locations of ice sheet meltwater are very different from those over past glacial-interglacial cycles. Climate perturbations caused by past meltwater pulses, therefore, should not be regarded as direct analogs of what would happen in intensive future warming scenarios, prompting the need for modeling the climate effects of future ice sheet melt. Experiments using different numerical models reveal robust climate responses to ice sheet melt. Freshening of the upper ocean by meltwater enhances stratification and leads to suppressed vertical mixing and heat exchange, cooling the atmosphere and ocean surface and warming the subsurface ocean 13 – 17 . These responses, in turn, are expected to influence ice sheet melting and retreat. Surface cooling reduces ice surface melting and meltwater-induced hydrofracturing and calving of ice shelves—a negative feedback, while subsurface warming enhances basal melting of ice shelves—a positive feedback. Which feedback would prevail during the retreat of the AIS under anthropogenic warming, however, remains unclear. Contradicting conclusions have been drawn out of simulations using offline-coupled ice sheet models (discussed further in the methods section) and atmosphere-ocean climate models, suggesting either the positive feedback associated with meltwater-induced subsurface warming could lead to further ice loss and aggravated sea level rise 13 , 15 , 18 , or the negative feedback from surface cooling could delay the progress of anthropogenic warming and its detrimental consequences, including the purported collapse of the marine-based portions of the AIS 17 , 19 . Although various Earth system models with built-in ice sheet components are under active development, e.g., the UKESM 20  and the E3SM 21 , they have not been used for studying centennial-scale ice sheet-climate feedbacks. Since ice sheet-climate interactions and associated feedbacks cannot be reliably simulated in the offline coupling framework with prescribed climate/ice sheet boundary conditions that preclude time-evolving interactions between the ice sheet, atmosphere, and ocean, the net effect of ice sheet FWF-climate interactions on future retreat of ice sheets remains unknown. Here we provide numerical simulations with a three-dimensional ice sheet model (ISM) quasi-synchronously coupled to a climate model of reduced complexity with a coupling time step of 1 year. The ISM is a 3-D dynamic-thermodynamic model that simulates ice sheets’ surface and basal mass balance using bias-corrected climate fields from the climate model, as well as processes including basal sliding and bedrock deformation 22 . The climate model is an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) that includes a three-dimensional ocean model, a land model, and a two-dimensional energy-moisture balance model for the atmosphere 23 . Using a reduced-complexity climate model enables carrying out a large set of multi-century scale simulations with different combinations of model configurations, climate sensitivities, emission scenarios, and initial conditions. Limitations of such model choices will be discussed in the Discussion section. The climate model’s output drives ice sheets’ mass balance and changes, while the ISM feeds back its simulated ice surface elevation and ice sheet FWF to the climate model. We focus on the interactions between ice sheet FWF and the climate for both the AIS and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) in historical-future climate scenarios specified by six Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). To account for uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of Earth’s climate system, we scale the atmospheric CO 2  concentration ( p CO 2 ) in historical and future scenarios up/down accordingly to emulate ECS higher/lower than the climate model’s intrinsic ECS. Four configurations of ice sheet-climate coupling are devised: (1) Ice sheet FWF passed to the ocean is kept constant at the preindustrial level for both ice sheets, though ice sheets respond to changes in the climate and their potential contribution to sea level is recorded, (2, 3) FWF from one ice sheet interacts with the climate (termed “interactive FWF” hereafter) while the other remains fixed, and (4) FWF is fully interactive from both ice sheets. In all configurations ice sheets can interact with the climate by feeding back their surface elevation to the climate model as a surface boundary condition. With ensemble runs to suppress noise due to internal variability, these configurations enable isolating the effect of FWF-climate interactions for each or both ice sheets."
31,results,"Results Scenario-dependence of ice sheet freshwater-climate feedbacks Substantial uncertainty persists with respect to the magnitude of future global warming, due not only to the uncertainty in future greenhouse gas emission, but also to the sensitivity of Earth’s climate in response to greenhouse gas forcing, which can be quantified by the metric ECS—the eventual rise in global-mean surface air temperature (GMSAT) in response to doubling  p CO 2 . Models participating in the latest generation (phase 6) of Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) display a range of ECS from 1.8 to 5.6 °C 24 . Under the same emission scenario, the large spread in ECS leads to very different changes in GMSAT across CMIP6 climate models. Inter-model differences in projected polar temperatures are even greater due to polar amplification, which would result in divergent future trajectories of polar ice sheets when climate model outputs are used to drive ice sheet models 25 . To study the climate feedbacks of ice sheet freshwater flux under a warming climate, it is necessary to consider a range of ECS in combination with representative warming scenarios, enveloped by optimistic cases with a low ECS and strongly mitigated emissions, and worse cases with a high ECS and intensive emissions. UVic-ESCM, the climate model used in our study, has an ECS of 3.4 °C 26 , close to the best estimate of 3.0 °C assessed by IPCC-AR6 27 . The model, however, displays a ~30% weaker polar amplification compared with more sophisticated climate models (Supplementary Fig.  4 ), thereby modeling less polar warming than a typical CMIP6 model with the same ECS (“Methods”). Given the same increase in  p CO 2 , UVic-ESCM with an emulated ECS of 4.0 °C would simulate polar warmings of roughly the same magnitude as typical CMIP6 models with an ECS around 3.0 °C would do. Considering these factors, we scale the CO 2  levels in historical-future scenarios to emulate three representative ECS (3.0 °C, 4.0 °C, and 5.6 °C), which produce roughly the same changes in polar temperatures as CMIP6 models with ECS of 2 °C, 3 °C, and 4 °C, respectively (“Methods”). Driven by these CO 2  trajectories, the coupled ice sheet-climate model (with interactive FWF from both ice sheets) shows that the peak ice sheet freshwater flux within the next few centuries varies by an order of magnitude between these scenarios (Fig.  1 a, b). The warmest future scenario considered here shows a peak FWF of 0.37 Sv for the GIS, and ~1.1 Sv for the AIS, a nearly total loss of the GIS by 2500, a collapse of the WAIS peaking around 2300 and an AIS contribution to GMSLR exceeding 10 m by 2500 (Fig.  1 ). In this warmest scenario, collapse of the WAIS is initiated around 2100, and is nearly concluded by 2400, with a contribution to sea level rise of more than 4 m over three centuries. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) weakens in all scenarios until the mid-twenty-first century, then diverges with continuous decline in the warmest scenarios but recovery and overshoot in scenarios with less warming.

Atmospheric CO 2  concentration is specified according to the historical (1850–2014) and six SSP scenarios (2015–2500), which are color-coded. Simulations with ECS of 3.0 °C, 4.0 °C, and 5.6 °C are shown in dashed, solid, and dash-dot lines, respectively. A group of simulations are carried out with fixed ice sheet FWF, i.e., ice sheet FWF received by the climate model is kept same as the long-term mean FWF simulated by the coupled ISM-climate model in pre-industrial conditions, but potential ice sheet sea level contribution is recorded. By comparing the outputs of simulations with fixed ice sheet FWF versus those with the same CO 2  trajectory but with interactive ice sheet FWF, we can evaluate the effect of ice sheet FWF-climate interactions. Increased ice sheet FWF generally reduces future global warming in all scenarios, with the largest reductions associated with higher ice sheet FWF (Fig.  1 d). Weakening of the AMOC is also more substantial in scenarios with more intensive ice sheet melt (Fig.  1 f). The GIS and the AIS, interestingly, display contrasting responses to ice sheet FWF-climate interactions (Fig.  1 h, j). The GIS retreats slower in most scenarios with interactive FWF, indicating an overall negative feedback (Fig.  1 h). This is consistent with the more pronounced and prolonged weakening of the AMOC in simulations with interactive FWF (Fig.  1 f), resulting in subdued meridional ocean heat transport into the North Atlantic and a relative cooling there (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Exceptions are seen in scenarios with the largest warmings, but these are likely due to trans-hemispheric influence from the Antarctic FWF, as discussed later. The AIS, in contrast, is dominated by the positive feedback, with the ice sheet retreating faster when FWF interacts with the climate in most scenarios, except those with the largest warmings and consequently the largest ice sheet FWF (Fig.  1 j). Both positive and negative feedbacks of ice sheet FWF-climate interactions are at play for the AIS, but the negative feedback strengthens faster with increasing FWF and prevails in the warmer scenarios. Competition between positive and negative feedbacks in Antarctica To obtain reliable signals, we carry out 10 ensemble simulations in each model configuration for two future warming scenarios, one representing a moderate warming with the  p CO 2  of SSP2-4.5 scaled to emulate an ECS of 4.0 °C, the other an intensive warming with the  p CO 2  of SSP5-8.5 scaled to emulate an ECS of 5.6 °C (“Methods”). Configurations with interactive Greenland FWF exhibit stronger and more prolonged weakening of the AMOC. In the intensive warming scenario, interactive Greenland FWF suppresses the AMOC throughout the simulations, preventing its recovery and overshoot (Fig.  2 e, f). Interactive Greenland FWF has a relatively small influence on the GMSAT, exhibiting a depression of ~0.1 °C in the warmest scenario, substantially weaker than that from the AIS FWF around the time of WAIS collapse (~0.5 °C, Fig.  2 c). The Greenland FWF-induced surface cooling of ~1 °C is concentrated in the North Atlantic to the south of Greenland accompanied by weaker warming elsewhere (Fig.  3 ), lessening its global-mean impact.

Ice sheet-climate feedbacks associated with Antarctic FWF are more complex than the Greenland case, involving competing negative and positive feedbacks. The sign of the net feedback is positive in the moderate warming scenario, where interactive Antarctic FWF accelerates ice loss throughout the simulation, doubling GMSLR attributable to Antarctica by 2500 (Fig.  2 j). In the intensive warming scenario, although interactive Antarctic FWF accelerates ice loss in early stages of warming before 2100, thereafter the negative feedback comes to dominance, substantially delaying and slowing down the WAIS collapse (Fig.  2 k). In mid 2200s, when the WAIS undergoes runaway retreat, interactive Antarctic FWF results in a WAIS contribution to GMSLR ~30% less than that from simulations without interactive Antarctic FWF. After 2400 in the intensive warming scenario, when the WAIS has collapsed in all four configurations, interactive Antarctic FWF remains effective in reducing the rate of ice loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (Fig.  2 l). Elevated Antarctic FWF from the retreating ice sheet enhances stratification of the upper ocean, thereby suppressing heat exchange between the cold Antarctic atmosphere and the relatively warm subsurface ocean, resulting in surface cooling and subsurface warming (Fig.  3 b, d). Additional surface cooling is generated by latent heat absorption by melting icebergs, calved from ice shelves constituting the solid fraction of FWF. Though icebergs are not explicitly simulated in our model and are treated as imposed sea ice flux (“Methods”), the associated energy budget remains valid. In year 2300 of simulations following the SSP5-8.5 scenario with an emulated ECS of 5.6 °C, when the WAIS is under a runaway retreat, the surface cooling effect of ice sheet FWF exceeds 3 °C over West Antarctica, while the subsurface warming approaches 3 °C in the Weddell Sea (Fig.  3 d). The fresher surface ocean, provided with less upwelling heat from the subsurface, is subject to more sea ice formation (Fig.  3 d). This expansion of sea ice introduces additional surface cooling via the ice-albedo feedback. Cooling of the ocean surface and the near-surface air would alleviate surface melting of the ice sheet and its ice shelves, constituting a negative feedback 19 . On the other hand, enhanced basal melting due to the subsurface oceanic warming thins ice shelves and speeds their flow, providing less buttressing to the grounded ice upstream and exacerbating ice sheet loss in a positive feedback. This positive feedback operates at the base of ice shelves, so its strength declines as the polar climate warming proceeds and ice shelves shrink in size. The negative surface cooling feedback, in contrast, is not solely dependent on the presence of ice shelves. This difference in locality between the positive and negative feedbacks may explain the sign-reversal of the net feedback in the intensive warming scenario after early 2100s (Fig.  2 n). In the moderate warming scenario, however, Antarctic ice shelf area does not dwindle as substantially, thereby maintaining a net positive feedback. The effect of ice sheet FWF-climate feedbacks on the AIS’ mass loss can be quantified by a feedback factor  γ , which is defined as one minus the ratio between the AIS’ mass loss rates in simulations with interactive ice sheet FWF and those in simulations with fixed ice sheet FWF (“Methods”). A positive feedback factor  γ  indicates that ice sheet FWF-climate feedbacks accelerate the AIS’ mass loss, and vice versa. Figure  4  presents the feedback factor  γ  as a function of the rate of ice loss from Antarctica (in Sv, freshwater flux equivalent).  γ  is positive for low ice loss rates and transitions to negative values around a threshold of 0.2 Sv. The transition of the net feedback from positive to negative is consistent with Fig.  2 . The peak amplitude of  γ  exceeds 0.5 for both the positive and the negative feedback regimes, indicating moderately strong feedbacks for ice sheet FWF-climate interactions. The strength of the negative feedback decreases as the ice loss rate exceeds ~0.4 Sv, corresponding to the stage of the WAIS collapse. In this stage, ice sheet instability mechanisms are at work, and the rate of ice loss is more strongly affected by ice sheet dynamics than atmospheric and oceanic thermal forcings, which may explain the decreasing feedback strength and irregularities at very large ice loss rates. Fig. 4 Ice loss-freshwater flux feedback factor as a function of ice loss rate from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Blue markers are based on simulations under the historical-SSP2-4.5 scenario with an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of 4.0 °C, while red markers are based on simulations under the historical-SSP5-8.5 scenario with an ECS of 5.6 °C. Definition of the feedback factor and its calculation are described in “Methods”. Inter-hemispheric ice sheet interactions via the AMOC Climate feedbacks associated with ice sheet FWF are not restricted to the respective ice sheet and its local climate, but display global influences. Compared with the simulation without interactive ice sheet FWF, in model configurations where FWF from either ice sheet is interactive, the other ice sheet’s mass loss is accelerated in the intensive warming scenario (Fig.  2 i, l). The presence of interactive Greenland FWF increases the Antarctic contribution to GMSLR by ~0.5 m around year 2500, compared to simulations without interactive Greenland FWF (Fig.  2 l). The influence of Antarctic FWF on the pace of GIS retreat, although smaller in magnitude (~0.1 m through 2300s), is nevertheless a robust feature that emerges unambiguously in the ensemble simulations (Fig.  2 i). These results suggest melting of one ice sheet amplifies other ice sheet’s mass loss. Note that by design, the numerical experiments keep sea level fixed, so the GIS and the AIS do not interact via their contribution to sea level changes as in the real world 28 . The trans-hemispheric impacts of ice sheet FWF shown here are likely dominated by influences on the AMOC. Greenland meltwater injects freshwater into the region of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation, thereby weakening the AMOC and reducing the trans-hemispheric oceanic heat transport from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) to the Northern Hemisphere (NH). This causes a North Atlantic cooling accompanied by a SH warming, which increases Antarctic ice loss (Supplementary Figs.  10 ,  11 ,  13 ). In contrast, Antarctic meltwater freshens the source region of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), which normally stays on top of the denser NADW. This reduces the density of AAIW, resulting in a stronger inflow of NADW into the SH and strengthening the AMOC (Supplementary Figs.  14 – 16  and Supplementary Movie  3 ), which warms the North Atlantic and enhances ice loss from the GIS (Supplementary Figs.  9 ,  11 ,  12 ). This inter-hemispheric link between high-latitude NH and SH climates, termed the “bipolar seesaw” 29 , was proposed as a potential mechanism for the concurrence of the Bølling-Allerød warm interval in the NH and the Antarctic Cold Reversal in the SH during the Last Deglaciation 11 , 30 , 31 ."
32,discussion,"Discussion Contradictory conclusions have been given in previous studies regarding the effect of ice sheet-climate interaction on the retreat of the AIS, with either a net positive feedback that accelerates its ice loss 15  (G19 hereafter), or a net negative feedback that ameliorates its decline 17 , 19  (S20 and D21 hereafter). These studies, however, investigate the feedbacks in integrated ice sheet-climate systems with similar offline or asynchronous coupling strategies, which cannot resolve time-evolving interactions between the ice sheet and climate. Here, we use a coupling time step of 1 year to enable near-synchronous coupling between the two models and better representation of their interactions, and carry out an ensemble of simulations that allow for more robust differentiation of configurations with or without interactive ice sheet FWF. Our study considers a variety of future warming scenarios generated from a combination of six CO 2  emission pathways with three ECSs and demonstrates a strong dependence of the feedback’s sign on the warming scenario. Concerning how the climate responses to ice sheet FWF feedback on ice sheet retreat, we find that previous conclusions are not necessarily conflicting and can be reconciled. In S20 and D21, the studies that show a net negative feedback, the Antarctic FWF were provided from ice sheet simulations forced by CCSM4, a climate model with an ECS of ~4.0 °C 32 , roughly two times higher than that of the model used in G19 (ECS = 1.9 °C 33 ). Simulations in S20 and D21 proceed to 2300, versus 2100 in G19, allowing a more thorough response of the AIS, hence more substantial retreat. The ice sheet model of S20 and D21 parameterizes hydrofracturing and ice cliff failure—two key processes for the Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) mechanism 34 , which facilitate disintegration of ice shelves in short order under intensive warming scenarios, leaving less ice shelf basal area to melt. Introducing MICI processes also increases the sensitivity of ice loss to atmospheric warming (via meltwater production) and may strengthen the negative feedback. In our coupled simulations, turning off ice cliff failure in the ISM indeed reduces the strength of negative feedback in intense warming scenarios (Supplementary Fig.  17 ). These factors result in faster ice loss from the AIS (especially from its ice shelves) in S20 and D21 than G19, thus emphasizing the dominance of the negative atmospheric cooling feedback. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study, and that ice sheet-climate interactions may be strongly model-dependent. The coupled ice sheet-climate model developed for this study was designed as a stopgap until more sophisticated Earth system models with fully integrated ice sheet components become mainstream. It provides a benchmark that can be used for comparison in subsequent studies using more comprehensive models. Compared with state-of-the-art climate models, the high throughput of the UVic-ESCM comes at the expense of reduced spatial resolution and model complexity, especially for its atmosphere model. Key aspects and processes of the modeling toolkit that need further improvement include but are not limited to: Spatial resolutions: the coupled ice sheet-climate model represents the large-scale processes controlling the feedbacks, but not the small-scale ones. Considerably higher spatial resolutions—in both ocean and atmosphere modules as well as in horizontal and vertical directions—are required to model processes vital for ice shelf basal melting, e.g., incursion of CDW onto continental shelves 35 , and precipitation at ice sheet margins with steep topography. The response to ice sheet meltwater can strongly depend on the ocean model’s spatial resolution and its parameterization schemes for mesoscale eddies and submesoscale eddy restratification. For instance, Antarctic meltwater is more efficiently trapped on the shelf in models with a better resolved and stronger Antarctic Slope Current (ASC), which produces subsurface cooling and suppresses further melt; In contrast, in models with a diffuse ASC, ice sheet meltwater more readily escapes to the open ocean, producing strong subsurface warming that accelerates further melt at the base of ice shelves 36 . Ice shelf cavity circulations: the ISM used in this study assumes a simple quadratic relationship between ice shelf basal melt rates and 400 m depth ocean temperatures of nearby ocean cells, without explicitly modeling ocean circulations within the cavity beneath the ice shelf. Intensive basal melting of ice shelves of the Amundsen Sea can induce an overturning circulation in the ice cavity and an inflow of warm water into the cavity, which pumps heat from the deep ocean toward the ocean surface, melting sea ice near the ice sheet margins 37 , 38 . Representation of icebergs: if the MICI mechanism is triggered by intensive warming, collapse of ice shelves and tall, mechanically unstable ice cliffs would release the bulk of FWF in the solid form—i.e., icebergs, which is not explicitly modeled in our study but is treated as added sea ice. Icebergs transport and release freshwater along their tracks from coastal Antarctica to warmer oceans, shifting the regions of freshwater injection equatorward 16 . In addition, most of the large tabular Antarctic icebergs are trapped in counter-clockwise currents along the coast for years before entering the “iceberg alley” of the Weddell Sea and drifting to lower latitudes 39 . This may shift the deposition of icebergs’ freshwater flux westward off the calving sites and lead to more freshwater flux into the Indian Ocean. Iceberg tracks cannot be accurately modeled with the coarse-resolution velocity field from our model, but ocean models with built-in iceberg modules are under activate development 40 , 41 . Depth of freshwater injection: the coupling scheme of this study injects ice sheet FWF to the top layer of the ocean model, while in the real world basal meltwater is injected at depth by both ice shelves and icebergs. This modeling choice is due to the lack of explicitly modeled ice shelf cavities and icebergs. Strengthening of ice shelf cavity circulations due to intensified basal melting may deepen the mixed layer around Antarctica, in contrast to iceberg meltwater, which is shown to enhance stratification 42 . Adding iceberg meltwater at depth was found to increase the magnitude of subsurface warming and sea ice trends 43 . This complexity could affect the positive feedback identified in this and previous studies. Ice sheet FWF-climate interactions are currently not accounted for in most comprehensive climate models, compromising model-based future projections of ice sheet retreat and associated sea level rise. To address this need, a number of climate models equipped with fully interactive ice sheet components are under development 20 , 21 . Next-generation models, based on results shown in this study, are expected to project an overall faster retreat of the AIS and associated sea level rise under anthropogenic warming unless/until a catastrophic collapse of the WAIS is initiated. Using high-resolution, dynamically comprehensive models to investigate ice sheet-climate feedbacks is a challenging task, in part because the coupled system takes millennia to equilibrate due to the long timescales of the deep ocean and ice sheet. Returning to the question as to which feedback dominates, however, recognizing the limitations of this study, more advanced and comprehensive modeling tools may tip the scale in either feedback’s favor. Mechanisms revealed by this coupled ISM-CM model study, including the dependence of ice sheet-climate feedbacks on the pace of warming, and the transition of the net feedback from positive to negative as ice shelves are lost, are potentially important for the sensitivity of ice sheets to climatic warming. They should be investigated more fully in coupled ice sheet-climate models that can better resolve the aforementioned processes that cannot be reliably represented by the model used in this study."

34,introduction,"Introduction Climate tipping elements are complex subsystems of the Earth system that can display non-linear, often abrupt transitions in response to anthropogenic global warming 1 , 2 . This means that a small increase in global mean temperature (GMT) can trigger a large qualitative change in these subsystems. Decreasing the forcing back to its pre-industrial value will often not reverse this change, as the transitions are driven by self-amplifying feedback mechanisms that lead to hysteresis behaviour 3 , 4 . Core tipping elements with planetary-scale impacts on the Earth system include cryosphere subsystems such as the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), large-scale oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and biosphere subsystems like the Amazon Rainforest (AMAZ), the four of which we will focus on in this study. Further tipping elements include Boreal Permafrost, extra-polar mountain glaciers, and tropical coral reefs, among others 2 . Many of these tipping elements are connected through interaction processes that can stabilise or exacerbate their individual dynamics 5 , 6 , potentially enabling tipping cascades 7 . This depends on the strength of the interactions and sensitivity to increases in GMT. Consequences of climate tipping would be severe and potentially include a global sea level rise of several metres, ecosystem collapse, widespread biodiversity loss, and substantial shifts in global heat redistribution and precipitation patterns 8 . Paleorecords, as well as observational and model-based studies, provide evidence of the multistability and hysteresis behaviour of single tipping elements 1 , 2 . In spite of this, most state-of-the-art high-dimensional earth system models (ESMs) do not yet comprehensively simulate the non-linear behaviour, feedback, and interactions between some of the tipping elements due to computational limitations and a lack of processes important for resolving tipping 9 – 11 . Most state-of-the-art ESMs do not include coupled dynamic ice sheets, which renders them unable to represent the tipping point dynamics of cryosphere tipping elements as well as their links and interactions with other tipping elements 12 . The resulting lack of freshwater forcing and sea level rise can have significant repercussions for the behaviour of ocean circulations in these models. For these reasons, these models may not be suited to fully resolve tipping dynamics and interactions 9 – 11 . A simplified but established complementary approach that we also utilise in this study is, therefore, to model tipping with fold-bifurcation models 6 , 7 , 13 , 14  (see Fig.  1 ). These conceptual models display hysteresis properties and tipping when a critical threshold is passed. The parameters of such conceptual models are based on process-understanding of the governing feedbacks of the tipping elements, such as Stommel’s salt-advection feedback for the AMOC or the melt-elevation feedback for the GIS 3 , 8 , 10 . They can be found to produce stability landscapes for single tipping elements similar to more complex domain-specific models (see Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Fig. 1 Tipping risk and interacting tipping elements. a  Schematic fold-bifurcation diagram of a model tipping element with global mean temperature (GMT) as a forcing parameter and two stable states separated by the unstable manifold. The red arrows indicate the feedback direction of the entire system if a forcing occurs. This means, that if the system is pushed across the unstable manifold, it will move towards the opposite stable equilibrium state.  b  Illustrative time-evolution of one sample model run of each tipping element: Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), Amazon Rainforest (AMAZ), including the threshold for state evaluation (dashed grey line). It has been argued that the tipping behaviour of the GIS is linked to an ice sheet volume threshold 15 , 16 . However, it has also been shown that this volume threshold can be linked to a GMT threshold 17 . Similarly, the tipping behaviour of the AMOC may be primarily linked to the rate of freshwater input into the North Atlantic and AMAZ tipping behaviour has been linked to the lack of sufficient moisture supply 18 . For consistency, we have here linked the bifurcation behaviour of the tipping elements back to a GMT threshold based on multiple lines of evidence, including Earth system modelling and paleoclimate data 2 . The urgency to understand and minimise climate tipping risks has been recognised in international climate policy for the first time at the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) in Egypt 19 . While uncertainties are still considerable, current best estimates find several tipping elements at risk at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial GMT levels 2  and early warning signals of an approaching transition have been observed for a number of tipping elements 20 – 23 . This provides strong scientific support for the Paris Agreement’s Article 2.1 long-term temperature goal (LTTG) aiming to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels 24 , which evidence increasingly shows is a limit, not an aspirational goal 2 , 25 . Global warming has reached 1.2 °C 26 , and current climate policy scenarios are estimated to result in 2.6 °C warming above pre-industrial levels 27  by the end of this century (with a range of 1.7–3.0 °C). Even if GMT were to be stabilised at or below 1.5 °C in the long term, a temporary overshoot above 1.5 °C is a distinct possibility and was presented prominently as the first of the Ten New Insights in Climate Science 2023/24 28 , underlining the urgency that potential impacts and associated risks of such an overshoot, including the triggering of potential tipping processes, need to be assessed 29 . Previous studies have schematically analysed how individual and interacting tipping elements 7  respond to idealised overshoot scenarios 13 , 30 , assessing the impacts of overshoot duration, peak temperature, and long-term stabilisation temperature on tipping risks. Uncertainties in critical temperatures and critical transition times, as well as—where applicable—interactions between tipping elements were incorporated. However, to systematically assess tipping risks (see Fig.  1 ) under a given climate policy and emission pathway, the uncertainty of the climate system in response to increasing atmospheric CO 2  levels (climate sensitivity and carbon-cycle feedbacks) must be taken into account 25 , 31 . Here, we use the PROVIDEv1.2 scenario overshoot pathways 32 —an extended version of the illustrative pathways identified in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 33 . The considered emission pathways span a range of different possible policies, including pathways that follow current policies and pledges, as well as pathways consistent with the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement. We study the full range of GMT outcomes for each emission pathway using multiple calibrations of the stylised Earth system model PyCascades of four interacting tipping elements 34  (GIS, WAIS, AMOC, and AMAZ), to assess tipping risks in the medium term (until 2300) and long term (in equilibrium, here after 50,000 years)."
35,results,"Results Tipping risks under overshoots The PROVIDEv1.2 emission pathways 32  cover the time from 1850 to 2300, harmonised to 2015 emission levels. GMT trajectories were derived using FaIR v.1.6.2 35  and extended linearly beyond 2300 to analyse long-term equilibrium behaviour. The mitigation objective, as set out in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, aims to support the achievement of the LTTG by establishing a global requirement to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (NZGHG) emissions (aggregated using Global Warming Potential over a 100-year horizon, or GWP100) in the second half of the 21st century 36 . This would lead to a declining GMT 37 – 39 . Scenarios that achieve net zero or negative emissions by 2100 and maintain them thereafter are classified as NZGHG emission scenarios. Table  1  contains the names and properties of all analysed scenarios. The criteria for classification are described in the “Methods” section in more detail. Table 1 Scenario classification Scenario Overshoot peak temperature NZGHG Stabilisation temperature Scenario assumptions CurPol-OS-1.5 C 3.30 °C No-NZGHG 1.5 °C Follows current (2020) policies until 2100, then declines ModAct-OS-1.5 C 2.69 °C No-NZGHG 1.5 °C Follows current (2020) pledges (NDCs) until 2100, then declines ModAct-OS-1C 2.69 °C No-NZGHG 1.0 °C Follows current (2020) pledges (NDCs) until 2100, then declines Ref-1p5 – Not defined 1.5 °C Reference scenario designed in temperature space SSP5-3.4-OS 2.35 °C No-long-term-NZGHG 1.5 °C Tests system response to rapid emission changes SSP1-1.9 1.53 °C No-long-term-NZGHG 1.0 °C Sustainable development, no long-term compensation for non-CO 2  emissions GS-NZGHG 1.70 °C NZGHG Pre-industrial Gradual strengthening, returns warming to 1.5 °C by 2215 SP-NZGHG 1.57 °C NZGHGP Pre-industrial Broad shift towards sustainable development Neg-NZGHG 1.67 °C NZGHG Pre-industrial Returns warming to 1.5 °C by 2100 with heavy CDR deployment Neg-OS-0C 1.67 °C NZGHG Pre-industrial Returns warming to 1.5 °C by 2100 with heavy CDR deployment The 10 analysed PROVIDEv1.2 emission pathways were classified according to their median overshoot peak temperature and achievement of net zero greenhouse gas emissions (NZGHG) (‘NZGHG’: reach NZGHG emissions by 2100 and maintain NZGHG emissions in the long term; ‘No-long-term-NZGHG’: reach NZGHG emissions by 2100 but do not maintain NZGHG emissions in the long term; ‘No-NZGHG’: do not reach NZGHG emissions by 2100), median long-term stabilisation temperatures, and scenario assumptions. Stabilisation temperature is given as median, NDCs denote Nationally Determined Contributions, and CDR denotes Carbon Dioxide Removal. For details on the NZGHG classification see Methods. A comprehensive risk assessment requires consideration of the combined risks 25  of uncertainties on future emission trajectories, uncertainties in the Earth system response to these emissions including climate sensitivity and carbon-cycle feedbacks, as well as uncertainties regarding the tipping dynamics (see Fig.  2 ). Therefore, all considered scenarios take the 10–90% emission-temperature uncertainty into account, which arises from the uncertainties in the carbon cycle and climate response (see Supplementary Fig.  2 ). The tipping-related uncertainties are propagated via a Monte Carlo ensemble approach (see the “Methods” section).

The ranges of AMOC and AMAZ extend beyond the plot up to 8.0 and 6.0 °C, respectively. Intensifying grey indicates an increasing risk that a threshold will be exceeded, with lines marking the centre estimates.  e  Timescales of the tipping elements, with centre estimate (dot) and estimated range, from committing the tipping until it is completed. For critical temperature ranges, timescales of tipping, and interactions between tipping elements, also see Supplementary Tables  1  and  2 . We find that tipping risks until 2300 are substantial for several of the assessed scenarios (see Fig.  3a, b ). In the long term, an overall increase in tipping risk is observed. The five pathways that do not return warming to below 1.5 °C by 2100 (CurPol-OS-1.5C, Mod-Act-OS-1.5C, Mod-Act-OS-1.0C, SSP5-3.4-OS, GS-NZGHG) display the highest risks in the medium term (Fig.  2a ), reaching 23–71% tipping risk for the scenario following current (2020) policies (median 45%; CurPol-OS-1.5C). The two pathways with less than 0.1 °C median overshoot above 1.5 °C display the lowest tipping risks in the medium term with 0–7% tipping risk (median < 1%; SP-NZGHG, SSP1-1.9). If warming is returned to below 1.5 °C by 2100 after a high overshoot (median peak temperature exceeds 1.5 °C by more than 0.1 °C), tipping risks remain at or below 10% (median 2%; Neg-OS-0C and Neg-NZGHG). Failing to return warming below 1.5 °C by 2100, despite reaching NZGHG in this time, results in tipping risks of 0–24% (median 4%; GS-NZGHG). This confirms that the risks of overshoot can be minimised if warming is swiftly reversed. However, this would require rapid employment of appropriate mitigation measures. Fig. 3 Tipping risk ranges for all emission scenarios. a  In the medium-term (until 2300) and  b  in the long-term (50,000 years), with the risk derived from the median temperature trajectory as centre dots and the range spanning the 10-90th temperature percentiles. IPCC likelihood ranges are given on the right 72 .  c  Peak temperature of the overshoot,  d  long-term stabilisation temperature relative to pre-industrial, with 1.5 °C as a dashed line, and  e  duration of the overshoot above 1.5 °C until 2300. In the long term, stabilisation temperature is one of the decisive variables for tipping risks (Fig.  2d ). We find that a long-term temperature stabilisation at 1.5 °C even without prior overshoot (Ref1p5) results in more than 50% tipping risk. Only the three scenarios that return median warming to below 1.5 °C by 2100 and maintain NZGHG thereafter (SP-NZGHG, Neg-NZGHG, Neg-OS-0C) retain long-term median risks in the very unlikely range, and upper risks below 12%. Fast tipping elements determine medium-term tipping risks In Fig.  4 , we show the medium- and long-term tipping risks for each of the four considered tipping elements. In the medium term the two faster tipping elements, AMOC (tipping time: 15–300 years) and AMAZ (tipping time: 50–200 years) display the highest risks while tipping remains below 11% for the two slow-onset tipping elements, GIS (tipping time: 1000–15,000 years) and WAIS (tipping time: 500–13,000 years). In the long term, risks are highest for AMOC and WAIS. Given the threshold ranges of both ice sheets, we would expect comparable outcomes for the GIS and WAIS; however, the tipping risk for GIS is significantly lower than for WAIS: Given its lower tipping timescale, the WAIS is anticipated to tip faster than the GIS for similar temperature overshoots. Additionally, a tipping AMOC would lead to strong cooling over the GIS and potentially stabilise it (see Fig.  2c ). Such strong stabilising effects are improbable to exist for the WAIS according to the newest literature 40 . Fig. 4 Tipping risk for each of the four investigated core climate tipping elements, Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), Amazon Rainforest (AMAZ). a  Medium-term tipping risk (until 2300).  b  Long-term tipping risk (model equilibrium). The  x -axis accounts for the uncertainties in climate response, with a 90% probability of the temperature outcome exceeding the lower bound (10th percentile), and a 10% probability of the temperature outcome exceeding the upper bound (90th percentile). The  y -axis denotes the tipping risk. IPCC likelihood ranges are given on the right 72 . As we see a comparatively little increase in tipping risk from the medium term to long term for AMAZ, we conclude that AMAZ tipping is mainly caused by the overshoot itself. The median tipping risk for the WAIS under SSP1-1.9 increases from <1% (medium-term) to 13% (long-term), and for the upper percentile from <1% to 52%, although the temperature converges below 1.5 °C. This can be explained by the fact that the tipping threshold ranges for the ice sheets begin well below 1.5 °C 2  (see Fig.  2d ). Ref-1p5 illustrates the tipping risks if peak temperature were limited to 1.5 °C and kept constant thereafter, excluding a temporary overshoot as the cause for tipping. Tipping risks in the medium term under Ref-1p5 are below 10% for all elements, however they significantly increase in the long term. Tipping risk by 2300 from overshooting 1.5 °C Due to different underlying mitigation assumptions, the scenarios included in this study cross the 1.5 °C limit at different times and follow different pathways to their peak and stabilisation temperatures (see Fig.  2b ). To consider the impact of these pathways in more detail, we treat the temperature trajectories for each scenario as individual data points, focusing the analysis on the temperature space. We assess the tipping risk per peak temperature for all trajectories that temporarily exceed 1.5 °C (Fig.  5a ). Fig. 5 Impact of overshoot peak temperature and non-linear acceleration in tipping risk. a  Increase in tipping risk (%) until 2300 per overshoot peak temperature, for all trajectories with overshoot above 1.5 °C. Each point represents one temperature percentile (10–90%) of a scenario and is coloured by the corresponding scenario information.  b  Acceleration in tipping risk for overshoot peak temperature. Each point represents the slope of a linear fit through a window of 25 adjacent data points of peak temperature vs. tipping risk (see panel  a ), thereby denoting the increase in tipping risk for this window, against the mean peak temperature within this window. The sliding window analysis is shown for all four tipping elements separately: Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), Amazon Rainforest (AMAZ), as well as for the combined risk of the four considered tipping elements (panel  b , yellow points). Shaded areas represent the 95% confidence interval. We find that tipping risk increases with peak warming above 1.5 °C (Fig.  5a ). To further investigate this increase in tipping risk, we apply a sliding window analysis across all overshoot trajectories (Fig.  5b ). Overall, the increase in tipping risk per additional 0.1 °C mean overshoot peak temperature per sliding window lies within a range of around 1.0–1.5% (Fig.  5b ) for mean peak temperatures below 2.0 °C, then notably accelerates until a mean peak temperature of about 2.5 °C, above which our analysis suggests a stabilisation of the increase in tipping risk per 0.1 °C above 3%. The contributions of the individual tipping elements to overall tipping risk increase are resolved in Fig.  5b . We find that while AMOC is the main driver of tipping risk increase at lower mean peak temperatures, the AMAZ is the main driver of the non-linear acceleration in tipping risk above 2.0 °C mean peak temperature. This can be explained by the onset of the AMAZ tipping threshold range at 2.0 °C (see Supplementary Table  1 ). However, the non-linear acceleration at ~2.0 °C mean peak temperature is also observed for the other tipping elements to smaller degrees (see also Supplementary Fig.  6b ). As an AMAZ tipping does not drive interactions in our model (compare Fig.  2c ), network effects enhancing this behaviour are driven by ice sheet or AMOC tipping (see Supplementary Fig.  6  for the impact of interactions). The same analysis was conducted with an alternative metric to quantify overshoot, defined by the warming during the overshoot averaged over the overshoot duration (see Supplementary Figs.  7 – 10 ). The results are similar to the use of peak temperature. Maintaining net zero greenhouse gas emissions to limit long-term tipping risks We evaluate the impact of the long-term adherence to achieving and maintaining at least NZGHG emissions on tipping risk for a wide range of climate outcomes per emission pathway (Fig.  6 ). We find that pathways that achieve at least NZGHG lead to substantially lower tipping probabilities compared to pathways that do not achieve NZGHG (No-NZGHG), or only do so for some time (No-long-term NZGHG, see Fig.  6 ). In addition, peak temperature appears to be indicative of tipping risk in the medium term. In the long term, stabilisation temperature, determined by long-term emission behaviour, becomes more decisive (Fig.  3d ). Fig. 6 Tipping risk assessed by adherence to the net zero greenhouse gas (NZGHG) criterion. Each point represents one temperature percentile (10–90%) of a scenario and is coloured by the peak temperature increase. Scenarios were grouped by their adherence to NZGHG (‘NZGHG’: reach NZGHG emissions by 2100 and maintain NZGHG emissions in the long term; ‘No-long-term-NZGHG’: reach NZGHG emissions by 2100, but do not maintain NZGHG emissions in the long term; ‘No-NZGHG’: do not reach NZGHG emissions by 2100) and assessed for both investigated timeframes. Point size is fixed. White boxes indicate the medium-term, grey boxes the long-term, with the upper and lower box edges of the boxplots corresponding to the interquartile ranges of the 25th and 75th percentiles of points per class and the line denoting the median. All three classes of pathways display higher tipping risk ranges in the long term than in the medium term. For pathways that only achieve and maintain NZGHG temporarily, the tipping risk range in the medium term is close to the range of the pathways that maintain NZGHG. In the long-term, however, these No-long-term-NZGHG scenarios reach significantly higher tipping risks. For NZGHG temperature trajectories, the median tipping risk remains below 2%, and only for a small number of high-warming trajectories, the risk exceeds 6%. Our results demonstrate that in order to minimise tipping risks in the long term, it is crucial to achieve at least NZGHG by 2100 as set out in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement and maintain it in the long term."
36,discussion,"Discussion Our study reveals that following current climate policies until 2100 may lead to high tipping risks even if long-term temperatures return to 1.5 °C by 2300. Under such an emission pathway, we report a tipping probability of 45% (median estimate, 10–90% range: 23–71%) until 2300 and of 76% (median estimate, 10–90% range: 39–98%) in the long term. Scenarios following pledged NDCs under the UNFCCC in 2020 until 2100 fail to adhere to the Paris Agreement LTTG, and even when subsequently designed such that temperatures return to 1.5 °C (median) after overshoot, we find that they are insufficient to avoid tipping risks (median estimate: 30%, 10–90% range: 10–56% until 2300). We find that tipping risk increases with every 0.1 °C of overshoot peak temperature. Further, we find a non-linear acceleration in tipping risk for peak overshoot temperatures above 2.0 °C resulting in more than 3% tipping risk increase per additional 0.1 °C peak temperature for overshoot temperatures exceeding 2.5 °C peak warming. This underscores the importance of the Paris Agreement climate objective 24  to hold warming to ‘well below 2 °C’ even in case of a temporary overshoot above 1.5 °C. Our results show that only achieving and maintaining net zero greenhouse gas emissions, associated with a long-term decline in global temperatures, effectively limits tipping risks over the coming centuries and beyond in line with earlier studies 2 , 8 , 13 . Our findings imply that stabilisation of global temperatures at or around 1.5 °C is insufficient to limit tipping risk in the long term. In order to effectively minimise this risk, our study suggests that temperature needs to return to below 1 °C above pre-industrial level. There is considerable uncertainty in the response of the climate system to the decline of emissions, and it is not clear how reversible GMT is after emissions cease 41 – 44 . Regional climate responses show high variability indicating that regional climatic changes might only be partially reversible 45 , 46 . Further, we cannot exclude that reinforcing feedbacks, which will ultimately lead to tipping, have already been triggered in the slow-onset cryospheric tipping elements 4 , 22 . The transient nature of an overshoot might offer a window of opportunity to counteract anthropogenic emissions with rapid interventions and stabilise the ice sheets before tipping is locked-in 22 , 47 . Possibilities of recovery and ways to recognise when a transition becomes locked-in and thereby truly irreversible are urgent topics for future research. While we assess the probabilities of at least one element tipping on the basis of mitigation behaviour until 2300, the implications of overshooting 1.5 °C will unfold over millennia 15 . For example, Global Mean Sea Level will continue to rise for up to 10,000 years or more after emissions have reached NZGHG, due to the slow response of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica 15 . The Global Mean Sea Level Rise (GMSLR) by 2300, committed from historic and currently pledged emissions until 2030, already amounts to 0.8–1.4 m 48 . Exceeding 1.5 °C may lead to a commitment of at least 2–3 m GMSLR on a timescale of 2000 years, and 6–7 m commitment on a 10,000-year timescale 15 . The GMT changes used to assess the tipping risk in this study are derived from emission scenarios with FaIR 35 , a simple climate model that is calibrated extensively to match observations and more complex model outputs 49 . Our risk assessment, however, neglects direct temperature feedbacks from destabilising tipping elements, e.g. from disintegrating GIS or WAIS 50  and does not include carbon releases from the AMAZ or permafrost thaw 51 – 54 . Some of these effects are implicitly accounted for via the uncertainty in the climate response included in this study. Our stylised Earth system model is designed for risk assessment under large uncertainties on climate tipping elements. As a simplification of the complex climate system, it does not allow us to make exact predictions about the characteristics of tipping 7 , 13 , 34 . We do not account for potential multistability, complex path-dependency, or spatial pattern formation 47 , 55 , 56 . Furthermore, processes that have the potential to further amplify risks, such as rate-induced tipping as recently suggested for the AMOC 57 , are not considered in our study. Anthropogenic influences other than GMT increase, such as changes in land-use 58 , are not part of the modelled dynamics, however they enter implicitly via the assumptions of some of the scenarios used in this study (for instance SSP1 and SSP5 58 , 59 ). These limitations render our results conservative, suggesting that tipping probabilities may well be even higher than we have found. This further underscores the need for a preventive approach to minimise overshoot. The scientific community is working towards more comprehensive and physically based models for the analysis of tipping dynamics, addressing and resolving some of these concerns e.g. under the Tipping Point Modelling Intercomparison Project (TIPMIP) 60 . While this work is under development, we here provide initial results and insights into which scenarios could be interesting to analyse in comprehensive models. The available quantifications of interactions are taken from an expert elicitation 5  and present a major uncertainty. It would be desirable to constrain this uncertainty better with further analyses, to include more tipping elements, as well as process-based dynamics. However, by including the uncertainties associated with climate sensitivity, carbon-cycle feedbacks, and emissions, and by propagating the uncertainties associated with the tipping elements, our assessment allows for robust results on the tipping risks induced by current mitigation levels and relevant policy scenarios. All scenarios in this study that fulfil and maintain NZGHG by 2100 rely on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to varying extents to complement emission reductions to achieve peak warming and allow for a decline in warming thereafter 61 , 62 . Large-scale deployment of CDR comes with its own concerns 63 , depending on the portfolio of CDR technologies deployed. Relying on mitigation technologies that have not yet been deployed at scale is risky 64 . Extensive reliance on land-based CDR options raises sustainability concerns, including competition for land used for food production 65  and impacts on terrestrial and marine biodiversity 66 . Some CDR techniques, such as afforestation will be threatened by climate change itself 67 . Beyond these concerns, deploying CDR at scale will lead to substantial economic costs 65  and unavoidably involve debates on fairness and equity 68 . The lowest need for CDR in our scenario selection is assumed in the SP-NZGHG scenario 69 , which contains very stringent reductions in global GHG emissions already by 2030, through a combination of strong policy interventions across multiple dimensions together with ambitious lifestyle changes. Under this scenario, substantial progress along the social and developmental dimensions would be undertaken without further exacerbating environmental degradation. However, substantial gaps in the fulfilment of all dimensions of this scenario remain due to inertia in existing systems and lack of global action 69 . In conclusion, our study shows that current policies and NDCs are not sufficient to minimise tipping risks, even if strong emission reductions after 2100 were to return temperatures to or below 1.5 °C in the long term. Every 0.1 °C of additional overshoot above 1.5 °C increases tipping risk, and greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero as early as possible and maintain it to minimise the risk of climate tipping points. Our results emphasise the fundamental relevance of the Paris Agreement climate objectives 24 , 62  for planetary stability. To effectively limit tipping risks, holding warming well below 2 °C at all times is essential even in case of a temporary overshoot above 1.5 °C. Beyond peak warming, achieving and maintaining net zero greenhouse gas emissions is paramount to limiting long-term tipping risks by bringing temperatures back down below 1.5 °C and beyond. Our results also illustrate that a global mean temperature increase of 1.5 °C is not “safe” in terms of planetary stability but must be seen as an upper limit. Returning to levels substantially lower, in the long run, might be desirable to limit tipping risks as well as other time-lagged climate impacts such as sea-level rise 15 , 48 . Domestic policies to reduce emissions need to be adopted and implemented, not only pledged 27 , and a more significant and urgent effort is needed to mitigate the risks associated with tipping elements."

38,introduction,"Introduction The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the ocean plays a pivotal role in both regional and global climate, via large-scale heat and freshwater transports. In the current climate, the MOC exists mainly in the Atlantic, referred to as the Atlantic MOC (AMOC), which is characterized by deep convection and deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea and Greenland-Iceland-Nordic (GIN) seas of the subpolar Atlantic 1 , 2 . The observed strength of the AMOC is approximately 18 Sv 3 . There is no equivalent Pacific MOC (PMOC) in the North Pacific. Geological evidence reveals that the primary deep-water formation region in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) might have undergone a shift from the Pacific to the Atlantic in the past. Some earlier studies suggested that North Pacific deep-water (NPDW) formation was strong during the Paleocene period (about 65–55 million years ago, or Ma) 4 , while the North Atlantic deep-water (NADW) formation was weak and likely began to develop at a later stage 5 , 6 . However, a recent study from the DeepMIP project found that neither model results nor proxy data suggest NADW formation during the early Eocene, while evidence for NPDW formation remains elusive. Consequently, the modern AMOC might initially develop in the late Miocene (about 12–9 Ma) and not be fully established until the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene (about 4–3 Ma) 7 . Nonetheless, a recent study from DeepMIP project found that neither model results nor proxy data suggest NADW formation during the early Eocene, while the evidence for NPDW formation remains inconclusive 8 . The actual evolutionary history of the AMOC and PMOC therefore remains a topic of considerable debate. The asymmetry of net surface freshwater flux is often cited as the cause of different overturning modes between the Atlantic and Pacific. The North Atlantic has higher sea-surface salinity (SSS) than the North Pacific because the former is a net evaporation basin, while the latter is nearly neutral 9 . Additionally, ocean basin geometry plays a role in the different overturning modes. Research indicated that narrow basins are more conducive to deep overturning circulation than wide basins 2 , 10 , 11 . Furthermore, ocean gateways also contribute to the different overturning modes. The opening of the Drake Passage/Tasman Seaway in the late Eocene is thought to have promoted the NADW formation and thus the AMOC formation 12 . Geological evidence also suggests that the uplift of large continental mountains has had a significant impact on the climate 13 . The evolution of continental terrain holds the potential to trigger large-scale transitions in the global MOC (GMOC) 14 – 16 , and in the following, we briefly review the uplift periods of the major modern mountain ranges. The Rocky Mountains (RMs) rose from the sea level about 80 Ma 17 , and reached its current elevation about 45 Ma 8 . Although the Transantarctic and Gamburtsev Mountains over Antarctica were likely already present at the start of the Cenozoic (65 Ma) 18 , 19 , the first large-scale glaciation of Antarctica is believed to have occurred during the Eocene-Oligocene transition period (34–33.5 Ma) 20 , 21 . The uplift of Andes Mountains (AMs) started in the Late Cretaceous (~70 Ma) 22  and matured around 15–10 Ma 23 , 24 . The uplift of these mountains predated the onset of the NADW formation. The Greenland (GL) underwent its initial phase of uplift in the late Miocene (11–10 Ma) 25 . The timeline for the formation of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a topic of highly debate. Some studies argue that parts of the TP were already in place during the late Eocene (38–33 Ma) 26 , 27 , while other research suggest that the TP’s rapid and main uplift occurred between 10 and 8 Ma 28 – 31 . A more recent study proposes that most of the TP had attained its current elevation before the Mid-Miocene (15 Ma) 32 . This timing coincides with the onset of NADW formation, suggesting a possible link between the TP uplift and the development of NADW. Recent research also indicates that the TP is a critical factor affecting changes in the GMOC 33 , 34 . Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that the chronology of the uplift of major mountain ranges remains a subject of intense discussion and investigation. Here, as a first step, we numerically investigate how the presence or absence of various major mountain ranges affect the GMOC as well as their cumulative impact when they are uplifted sequentially in the model from an initial flat Earth. In order to isolate the topographic effects from plate tectonics and long-term bathymetric and atmospheric changes, we keep the modern bathymetry and continental positions, as well as modern greenhouse gas concentrations, incident solar radiation and orbital parameters. We show that, in our simulations (Methods and Table  1 ), the TP uplift is the primary driver of the PMOC shutdown and the AMOC initiation, although high Antarctic topography is required to drive a strong, modern-like AMOC. We further discuss the implications of our results to the long-term Cenozoic history of the AMOC/PMOC.

39,results,"Results Adding mountains sequentially to flat continent in the model can ultimately lead to the establishment of the AMOC and the collapse of the PMOC (Fig.  1 ). However, this dramatic change occurs only after the TP is added. In the Flat scenario, the MOC features a modest PMOC of about 109 Sv and a negligible AMOC of less than 1 Sv, consistent with previous findings 14 – 16 , 34 , 35 . Following the TP uplift in model year 4001 (red curve), the AMOC recovers rapidly, overshoots its realistic value in about 800 years, and reaches an equilibrium state in about 1000 years, which matches the normal state in Real of about 18 Sv (gray line). Overshooting during AMOC recovery is common in freshwater hosing experiments 36 , CO2 forcing experiments 37 , and other paleoclimate simulations 38 , although their mechanisms may differ. Simultaneously, the PMOC collapses quickly (blue curve), and reaches an “off” state in Real of about 4 Sv in about 200 years. It suggests that the AMOC would be difficult to establish in the absence of the TP, while the PMOC would not exist in the presence of the TP. Fig. 1 Temporal evolutions of the Atlantic meridional overturing circulation (AMOC) and Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) with the sequential uplift of different mountains in Flat2Real. The AMOC is represented by a red-scale colored curve, and the PMOC, by a blue-scale colored curve. Each segment corresponds to one mountain uplift. The “+“ sign is used to indicate that a topography is added to the previous stage. The AMOC and PMOC indexes are defined as the maximum meridional overturning streamfunction (units: Sv, 1 Sv = 10 6  m 3 /s) between 20° and 70°N and below 500-m depth in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, respectively. Each time series is smoothed using a 51-year running mean. The mountain uplifts here are the Rocky Mountains (RM), Antarctic (AT), Andes Mountains (AM), Greenland (GL), and Tibetan Plateau (TP). None of the individual topography uplift from the Flat terrain is capable of initiating the AMOC. However, the TP uplift alone can cause the collapse of the PMOC (Fig.  2a ). The presence of individual AT and AM, on the other hand, can result in a stronger PMOC than that in Flat. As demonstrated by Jiang and Yang 39 , the presence of the RM alone has negligible effects on both AMOC and PMOC. Although the presence of the TP alone leads to a slight increase in the AMOC strength (approximately 2 Sv), it is inadequate for its complete establishment. Conversely, the PMOC is practically abolished in the presence of the TP alone. Fig. 2 Temporal evolution of the Atlantic meridional overturing circulation (AMOC) and Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC) in different topography experiments. Details of these experiments are given in Table  1 . The AMOC and PMOC are represented by red-scale and blue-scale colored curves, respectively.  a  Results of individual topography experiments.  b  Results of Tibetan Plateau (TP) plus another topography. All curves are smoothed using a 51-year running mean. Dashed gray reference lines in  a  and  b  indicate the mean strengths of the AMOC and PMOC in Real, which are 18 and 4 Sv, respectively. Studies have demonstrated that the removal of the TP can result in the collapse of the AMOC 33 , 34 , 40 . This implies that the combination of the RM, AM, AT, and GL is insufficient to sustain the AMOC. Indeed, this is precisely the situation before the TP is added, as illustrated in Fig.  1 . Moreover, we investigated the impacts of various combinations of RM, AM, AT, and GL; and none of these arrangements can establish the AMOC, irrespective of the order in which they were introduced to Flat. As the TP alone cannot support the establishment of the AMOC, we are left with the question: what is the minimum topographic requirement, in addition to the presence of the TP, for the establishment of the AMOC? We find that only the combination of the TP and AT can lead to the establishment of the AMOC from Flat, whereas the combination of the TP with any other mountains is ineffective (Fig.  2b ). With TP + AT, the AMOC gradually increases within the first 800 years, followed by a sharp increase to a very high level in a short time, ultimately reaching quasi-equilibrium in approximately 2000 years, with the magnitude equivalent to that in Real. However, in the other combinations, even after an integration of 2200 years, the AMOC does not increase significantly. These experiments suggest that only the AT effectively assists the TP in the formation of the AMOC. Conversely, the PMOC quickly disappears in any experiment where the TP is present. Figure  3  shows the patterns of the AMOC, PMOC, and GMOC in each experiment. In Flat (Fig.  3a1, a2 ), only the shallow wind-driven subtropical cells (STCs) are present in the Atlantic; while the PMOC is strong, it has a weak inter-hemispheric structure (Fig.  3b1, b2 ), consisting of the wind-driven STCs and subpolar thermohaline circulations. In the Pacific, the wind-driven STCs are strong and hemispherically symmetric, occupying the upper 500-m ocean between 30°S and 30°N. The thermohaline circulation originates in the North Pacific north of 30°N, and its lower branch occupies the deep ocean beneath 1000 m, extending to the Southern Ocean. The PMOC in the South Pacific (Fig.  3b2 ) is much weaker than the AMOC in the South Atlantic in Real (Fig.  3a8 ). The structure of strong PMOC and weak AMOC is maintained in Flat2Real before the TP uplift, and in the experiments without the TP. Fig. 3 Patterns of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in different experiments. a – c  The Atlantic MOC (AMOC) and Pacific MOC (PMOC), and global MOC (GMOC) in Flat2Real, respectively. The first (second) column shows the MOC patterns averaged over years 701–800 (years 1501–1600) of Flat. The third to seventh columns show the MOC patterns averaged over years 1801–2000, 2201–2400, 3201–3400, 3801–4000, and 5601–6000 of Flat2Real, respectively, corresponding to the sequential uplift of different mountains. The last column shows the MOC pattern averaged over years 2501–3000 of Real.  d – f  The MOC patterns for the last 200 years of each experiment (from left to right): AT (Antarctic), AM (Andes Mountains), GL (Greenland), TP (Tibetan Plateau), TP + RM (Rocky Mountains), TP + GL, TP + AM, and TP + AT. The vertical coordinate is depth (units: km). The uplift of the TP appears to have fundamentally changed the GMOC. Based on the experiments we conducted, we conclude that the TP is a necessary condition for the “on” state of the AMOC and a sufficient condition for the “off” state of the PMOC. The AT is also critical to the establishment of the AMOC. Among the various topographic features, the TP stands the most significant factor influencing the GMOC. Compared to Real, the MOC in Flat results from three key factors: 1) higher net evaporation in the North Pacific and greater precipitation in the North Atlantic, 2) stronger Ekman downwelling in the North Pacific, and 3) weaker Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean and associated weaker southward water mass transport in the intermediate-to-deep South Pacific. The first two factors contribute to the formation of the NPDW and the shutdown of the NADW, while the third factor weakens the thermohaline component of the PMOC. The impacts of net evaporation in the North Atlantic and Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean on the AMOC have been well recognized 41 – 46 . Here, we quantify their roles using topography experiments. In Real, the sea-surface density (SSD) in the subpolar Atlantic is over 27.5 σ 0 , which is sufficient for the NADW formation, even with Ekman upwelling (Fig.  4b ). However, in Flat the SSD in the North Atlantic is reduced to 25.5 σ 0  (Fig.  4a ); and this reduction (Δσ ~ 2.0 kg/m 3 ) (Fig.  4e ) is significant enough to halt the NADW formation. In Real, the North Pacific SSD is 25.5-26 σ 0 ; and in Flat, it is increased to 26.5 σ 0  in the Northeast Pacific (Fig.  4a ). This increase (Δσ ~ 0.5 kg/m 3 ) is sufficient for shallow surface-water subduction, but is insufficient for deep-water formation, which requires the assistance from enhanced Ekman downwelling (Fig.  4e ) 34 . Note that the physical processes involved in NADW formation in Real and NPDW formation in Flat are not the same. The former primarily involves thermohaline dynamics, while the latter involves both thermohaline and wind-driven dynamics 35 .

The change in SSD from Real to Flat can be attributed to the change in SSS (Fig.  4i ), in which the virtual salt flux resulting from net evaporation (i.e., evaporation minus precipitation, or EMP) and sea-ice melting (Supplementary Fig.  2b1 ) playing crucial roles. The contribution of sea-surface temperature change to SSD change is limited 34 .

In the transition from Real to Flat, aided by anomalous lows over the North Atlantic and North American continent (Supplementary Fig.  3b1 ), more atmospheric moisture is transported eastward from the North Pacific and north-eastward from the central tropical Pacific to the North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.  3a1 ), leading to increased moisture convergence over the North Atlantic. Later, the southward expansion of sea ice in the subpolar Atlantic results in sea-ice melting at the same time, providing a substantial amount of fresh water into the ocean (Supplementary Fig.  2b1 ), eventually leading to the shutdown of the AMOC. Meanwhile, aided by anomalous highs over the North Pacific and southern China (Supplementary Fig.  3b1 ), less atmospheric water vapor converges over the western tropical and subtropical Pacific (Supplementary Fig.  3a1 ), causing an increase in SSS there (Fig.  4i ). The resulting high-salinity surface water is transported northward by the Kuroshio Current and further eastward by the Kuroshio Extension, thereby triggering the NPDW formation. The anomalous high over the North Pacific also leads to Ekman downwelling (Fig.  4e ), which further aids the NPDW formation. These two processes collectively lead to the establishment of the PMOC in Flat. In Flat, the thermohaline component of the PMOC in the South Indo-Pacific is weaker than that of the AMOC in Real (Fig.  3 b2 vs a8). This can be attributed to the weaker Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean in Flat in comparison to that in Real (Fig.  5a ). The absence of the Antarctic topography induces a high-pressure anomaly over the Antarctic, which produces an anomalous northward pressure gradient, and thus an anomalous easterlies based on the geostrophic balance. This eventually results in an 80% reduction in wind stress and Ekman pumping along the Antarctic continent (Fig.  5a ). The impact of this reduction on the MOC is evident in Fig.  3c1–c3 , with the Deacon cell being weakened by 50% in Flat. As a result, the southward water mass transport in the intermediate-to-deep ocean across 30°S is about 30% weaker in Flat when compared to that in Real (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Fig. 5 Changes in wind, Ekman pumping, and mass transport. a – d  Equilibrium changes of wind stress at 850 hPa (vector; units: m/s) and Ekman pumping (shading; units: cm/day) in Flat2Real (Year 5601–6000), TP (Tibetan Plateau), AT (Antarctic), and TP + AT, respectively, with respect to Flat. Positive (negative) value indicates Ekman upwelling (downwelling). Ekman pumping is calculated using the surface wind stress as described in Fig.  4 .  e – h  Equilibrium changes of zonally integrated net meridional water mass transport (units: Sv) across 30°S in Flat2Real, TP, AT, and TP + AT, respectively, with respect to Flat. The mean net meridional mass transport in Flat is plotted as a dotted curve, with the red and blue curves indicating the Atlantic and Pacific, respectively. Positive value represents northward transport. The vertical coordinate in  e – h  is depth (units: km). Once we recognize the changes in the MOC from Real to Flat, it becomes easy to understand the MOC changes in TP. From Flat to TP, the changes in the NH atmospheric circulation and moisture transport (Supplementary Fig.  3a4, b4 ) are similar to those from Flat to Real (Supplementary Fig.  3a2, b2 ). Consequently, we see similar changes in SSD, SSS, and Ekman pumping in TP as those in Real (Fig.  4b, f, j, and c, g, k ). Specifically, the TP uplift leads to more net precipitation (Supplementary Fig.  2b3 ) and thus smaller SSD in the North Pacific, and a stronger Ekman upwelling in the North Pacific (Fig.  4g ), which jointly shut down the PMOC. Moreover, the TP uplift causes less atmospheric moisture transport from the central tropical Pacific to the North Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.  3a4 ), resulting in accumulation of more saline surface water in the North Atlantic. However, the SSD in the North Atlantic (Fig.  4g ) is still smaller than in Real (Fig.  4f ) at this stage. The AMOC shows only a slight increase (Fig.  2a ). Furthermore, the Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean in TP is much weaker than that in Real (Fig.  5b ), which limits further development of the AMOC. The presence of the AT alone does not alter the surface buoyancy in the NH (figure not shown). Similar to Flat, the NPDW formation occurs instead of the NADW formation. However, the Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean in AT is as robust as that in Real (Fig.  5c ), resulting in a more potent Deacon cell (Fig.  3f1 ) and a more forceful thermohaline component of the PMOC (Fig.  3e1 ) than those in Flat. Similar to Flat, the strong southward water mass transport occurs in the South Indo-Pacific, but not in the South Atlantic (Fig.  5g , Supplementary Fig.  4 ). With the assistance of the AT, the establishment of the AMOC in TP + AT becomes possible (Fig.  3d8 ). The presence of the TP shuts down the PMOC, shifting the deep-water formation from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic. Simultaneously, the presence of the AT leads to strong Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean, which enhances the NADW formation remotely (Fig.  4l ). The MOC patterns in TP + AT are almost identical to those in Real (Fig.  3 d8 vs  a8) since both the surface buoyancy in the North Atlantic and the Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean are almost identical to those in Real (Figs.  4 d and  5d ). Note that in TP + AT, there is strong southward water mass transport in the South Atlantic, instead of in the South Indo-Pacific as in AT (Fig.  5g, h , Supplementary Fig.  4 ), because the presence of the TP alters the deep-water formation in the NH, which allows only the NADW to reach the Southern Ocean. The presence of other large topographies, such as AM, RM, and GL, would not switch the MOC from the Pacific to the Atlantic. However, the PMOC in Exp AM is noticeably stronger than that in Flat (Fig.  2a ). The presence of the AM reduces the equatorial trade wind, but amplifies the off-equatorial Ekman pumping (Supplementary Fig.  5a ), thereby boosting the wind-driven STC in the South Indo-Pacific (Supplementary Fig.  5b ) and augmenting the thermohaline component of the PMOC there, leading to a stronger PMOC (Fig.  3e2 ). On the other hand, both the RM and GL have minimal effects on the PMOC (Fig.  3a3–f3 ) because their presences do not significantly alter the global atmospheric moisture pattern 30  and the atmospheric circulation in the tropics (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The AMOC gradually increases in the first few hundred years after the TP uplift in both Flat2Real and TP + AT, followed by an acceleration and eventual return to a normal state in Real (Figs.  1  and  2b ). The latter process is accompanied by a swift sea-ice loss in the subpolar Atlantic. In response to the TP uplift, more atmospheric moisture converges (diverges) over the North Pacific (Atlantic) (Supplementary Figs.  2 b2, b5 and  3 a2,  a3 ), shutting down the PMOC and triggering a gradual increase of the AMOC at the same time. The latter enhances the northward heat transport in the Atlantic, leading to a gradual retreat of sea ice in the subpolar Atlantic. The sea ice retreat is also helped by the anomalous northward Ekman flow, forced by the anomalous easterlies over the subpolar Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.  3b2 ). The evolution of sea ice in Flat2Real is shown in Fig.  6 . The northward retreat of sea ice is illustrated by the sea ice velocity in Fig.  6b , which leads to additional freshwater loss in this region (Supplementary Fig.  2 b2,  b5 ). This freshwater loss in turn increases SSD, the NADW formation and thus the AMOC consequently. In the first few hundred years after adding the TP, the sea-ice in the subpolar Atlantic retreats northward slightly (Fig.  6b ), and the March mixed layer depth (MLD) deepens slightly (Fig.  6a ), corresponding to a gradual increase of the AMOC. About 500 years after the TP uplift, the collective effects of accumulated saline water in the subpolar Atlantic and Ekman pumping in Southern Ocean accelerate the AMOC, so that the sea-ice margin retreats rapidly northward (Fig.  6b , dashed red curve), resulting in a large amount of freshwater flux loss in the subpolar Atlantic, a rapid deepening of the MLD (Fig.  6a ), and a further enhancement of the AMOC (Figs.  1  and  2b ). The sea-ice margin reaches its quasi-equilibrium roughly 1000 years after the TP uplift (Fig.  6b ), accompanied by significant sea-ice melting in the GIN seas. The sea-ice evolution in TP + AT (Supplementary Fig.  7a, b ) displays a similar pattern to that in Flat2Real, while changes in sea ice and MLD in TP are minimal (Supplementary Fig.  7c, d ). The evolutions of AMOC, the MLD and sea-ice coverage and margin in Flat2Real and TP + AT suggest a positive feedback between the AMOC and sea ice changes, which eventually leads to the establishment of AMOC. This feedback has been shown in many previous studies 34 , 47 .

40,discussion,"Discussion Continental topography plays a vital role in shaping Earth’s climate. By conducting topography perturbation experiments, we can observe the dynamic processes by which atmospheric freshwater converges over the Pacific and diverges over the Atlantic in response to the TP uplift. These processes shut down the PMOC and enhance the NADW formation. The latter process then starts a positive feedback loop between the AMOC and sea ice in the subpolar Atlantic, pushing the final establishment of the AMOC. The TP acts as a giant attractor of fresh water in the NH, while the Antarctic continent acts as a giant draught-fan engine that forces Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean, contributing to the establishment of the global ocean conveyor belt. Although no single mountain range can lead to the full establishment of the AMOC, the TP alone can shut down the PMOC. The presence of the TP can modulate the global hydrological cycle in a fundamental way, which may have shaped the modern-day thermohaline circulation. Our experiments illustrate the dynamic contribution of Ekman pumping in the Southern Ocean to the GMOC, which is consistent with previous findings 43 , 44 , 48 . However, this Ekman pumping can pump water from either the North Pacific or the North Atlantic, depending on in which basin the NH deep-water formation occurs. Only after the TP uplift, the change in global hydrological cycle leads to more saline water accumulated in the North Atlantic, initializing the NADW formation. Assisted by strong Ekman pumping due to the AT, the AMOC can be established. In addition, our topography experiments show a clear planetary wave train in the NH mid-to-high latitudes (Supplementary Fig.  3 ) connecting the Eurasian continent, the North Pacific, the North American continent, and the North Atlantic as the atmospheric circulation changes with the addition of the TP. This wave train structure is similar to that observed from Flat to Real, highlighting TP’s global effects. No other topography can force this kind of wave train structure in the NH. The results presented here are a first step toward a better understanding of the coupled impacts of the presence or absence of various major mountain ranges on the GMOC, as well as their cumulative impact under modern conditions. Our experiments are specifically designed to disentangle the impact of topography on ocean circulation from other contributing factors, thereby keeping the bathymetry and continental configuration, as well as greenhouse gases, incident solar radiation, and orbital parameters to their modern state in our experimental setup. The individual mountain uplift experiments in this study allow us to explore the links and teleconnections between uplift regions and the climate of the modern world. Moreover, the sequential mountain uplift experiment Flat2Real may offer interesting insights about the long-term impact of mountains on Cenozoic climate change, notwithstanding significant caveats. Previous studies suggested that the TP uplift played a key role in shaping Cenozoic climate through circulation changes and weathering 13 , 49 , 50 : over the past 40 million years, this uplift led to substantial deflection of the atmospheric jet stream, intensified monsoonal circulation, increased rainfall on the front slopes of the Himalayas, and conductive conditions for the formation of deep and intermediate waters in the North Atlantic. By using experiment Flat as a starting point and tracing the changes due to various uplifts, we can quantify the linkages between uplifts and climate changes and understand how the MOC changes as the progressive uplift of continental mountains. It should be noted that the conclusions of this study may have some limitations due to the model employed. For instance, the model resolution may not be optimal for analyzing the impact of topography on the global climate, as models with coarse resolution may not adequately reproduce the effects of mountain ranges with complex topography, particularly those with an elongated shape such as the Andes or the Rockies. Additionally, we did not consider the effects of continental drift and oceanic gateway switches, nor did we treat Greenland and Antarctic glaciation dynamically. The setup of modern land-sea mask and ocean gateways in our experiments implies that the TP impact on the GMOC could be exaggerated. The Tethys Seaway closing, the Panama Isthmus closing and the Bering Strait opening all occurred after the TP uplift 8 , all of which may lead to significant changes in ocean circulation and modulate NADW formation 51 – 53 . Furthermore, the background climate in the experiments uses the preindustrial conditions with constant CO 2 , and the effect of chemical erosion in rapidly uplifted areas on atmospheric CO 2  is not accounted for. Typically, atmospheric CO 2  levels cannot remain in a steady state during the time of intense tectonism, which can last for millions of years, due to the temperature-weathering feedback mechanism. The TP uplift may have resulted in a decrease of atmospheric CO 2  level, which can also enhance the NADW formation due to the growth of large continental ice sheets in the NH 49 . To better understand the uplift effect on the global climate, it is essential to gain a quantitative understanding of the long-term carbon cycle. Overall, there are many factors at play in long-term climate change, and their effects remain poorly constrained. We still want to emphasize that our model results capture the basic direction of climate change. The uplift of giant mountains undoubtedly played a significant role in the evolution of global thermohaline circulation; and our results align with those of other orography experiments conducted using different models 14 – 16 , 40 . However, the impact of giant mountains on the AMOC remains a topic of debate, and our results contribute to a better understanding of the controls exerted by mountain ranges over the MOC, which is critical for a better comprehension of the role of the ocean in past and future climate transitions."

42,introduction,"Introduction As a key climate regulator, the ocean has slowed anthropogenic climate change by absorbing 91% of the heat trapped in the Earth system between 1971 and 2018 1  and 26% of anthropogenic carbon emitted since the preindustrial period 2 . Subsequently, it will play a crucial role in determining future climate. Air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide primarily arise from the air-sea disequilibrium of the partial pressure of CO 2 , driven by two main mechanisms: (i) the solubility pump, associated with CO 2  gas solubility and circulation, and (ii) the biological pump, the photosynthetic conversion of near-surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into organic matter that is exported into the ocean interior via gravitational sinking and circulation 3 . Through mechanism (ii), the biological carbon pump (BCP) effectively reduces surface-preformed DIC while increasing remineralized DIC at depth. This vertical redistribution and variations in preformed to remineralized DIC determines the partitioning of ocean-atmosphere carbon stocks 4 . Using an atmosphere-ocean equilibrium relationship, it is estimated that when the remineralized carbon stock is removed, atmospheric CO 2  levels would be approximately 150-240 ppm higher in the new equilibrium state 5 . Currently the BCP is often considered to operate at steady state, with the physically-driven solubility pump considered to have dominated the projected increase in current and future carbon sink and storage rates 6 , 7 , due to the limited observational evidence and knowledge on the non-linear interactions and feedbacks between BCP and other Earth system components 8 . As a result, there is currently no consensus on the projected changes in BCP efficiency. Repeated attempts to quantify the importance of BCP for future carbon storage have been conducted using ocean models of varying complexities. These include altering the chemical stoichiometry of organic matter production 9 , changing the remineralization depth 10 , enhancing micronutrient fertilization 11 , and simulating future climate change with an abiotic ocean (i.e., by complete removal of all marine organisms) 12 , among others. All these studies were performed with stand-alone ocean models, neglecting the carbon cycle feedback processes that occur between the ocean, land, and atmosphere. Such approaches can either underestimate or overestimate the impact of changing BCP on the long-term ocean carbon uptake 8 . In the face of rapidly intensifying climate change and anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems, better quantification of BCP’s role in mitigating future climate change is of fundamental importance for climate science and policy developments. Here, we assess the role of the BCP in setting up the preindustrial climate and quantify the impacts of its removal on future carbon sequestration and climate change. We apply the state-of-the-art Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2) 13 , 14  in its fully interactive configuration to simulate quasi-equilibrium preindustrial climate and subsequently project historical and future climate scenarios with and without marine organisms (see “Methods”). The impacts across three future scenarios, ranging from high CO 2  emissions SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) to a strong mitigation SSP1-2.6 15 , are investigated. Our simulations allow for prognostic atmospheric CO 2  concentration, taking into account carbon fluxes from land and ocean and the associated feedback to the climate system. The preindustrial reorganization of the carbon pools across the Earth system in the absence of BCP leads to more than 50% (163 ppm) higher atmospheric CO 2  and a 1.6 °C warmer surface temperature. Consequently, the Earth system’s capacity to buffer anthropogenically-induced climate change is hampered. Despite having lower DIC content, an abiotic ocean counterintuitively has a higher surface DIC and pCO 2  concentration, leading to a higher Revelle factor and a reduced anthropogenic carbon uptake. Future land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to reduce considerably, accelerating and amplifying anthropogenic climate change."
43,results,"Results Preindustrial states Two distinct quasi-equilibrium preindustrial climate states are simulated, with and without ocean biology (hereafter referred to as  REF  and  Abiotic , respectively; see Methods and Supplementary Table  1 ). Key climate metrics and carbon budget estimates for these two preindustrial states are summarized in Table  1 . The  Abiotic  ocean releases roughly 730 Pg C to the atmosphere during the 2000-year spin-up period (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Of this, 345 Pg C is adsorbed by land, primarily through CO 2  fertilization-induced vegetation growth 16 . The remainder stays in the atmosphere, leading to a 163 ppm higher CO 2  concentration (445 ppm) compared to  REF  (282 ppm). This increases global mean surface temperature by 1.64 °C, while sea surface temperature (SST) increases by 1.15 °C. This warming leads to considerable impacts on the Earth system, such as reducing Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength (9%) and sea-ice area in the Arctic and Antarctic (23 and 24%, respectively; Table  1 ). Changes in sea-ice extent are seasonally non-uniform, with September Arctic sea-ice reducing the most, by more than half. Without ocean biology, global ocean temperature increases from 3.56 to 4.66 °C, and as the surface ocean equilibrates with the higher atmospheric CO 2  concentration, its Revelle factor increases by 16%.

The spatial patterns of surface temperature in the two preindustrial climate states are similar but warmer everywhere in the  Abiotic  (Supplementary Fig.  2 a, b). The  Abiotic  ocean exhibits stronger CO 2  outgassing in the tropical oceans and ingassing in the mid-to-high latitudes (Supplementary Fig.  2 d, e). The zonal outgassing band along the Southern Ocean circumpolar fronts seen in  REF , associated with the upwelling of remineralized carbon-rich watermasses 17 , switches into a net sink in  Abiotic . In the subtropical oligotrophic, the rates of CO 2  flux are relatively similar in  REF  and  Abiotic . The altered land carbon budget includes an increased vegetation carbon pool, with the largest increase simulated in the tropics region, followed by high-latitude ecosystems in the northern hemisphere (Supplementary Fig.  2 g, h). The stronger and expanded tropical outgassing in the  Abiotic  is consistent with (i) an absence of biological consumption of surface DIC and (ii) warming-induced lower CO 2  solubility, both of which increase surface pCO 2 . In the high latitudes, stronger uptakes can be explained by the amplification of the seasonal cycle. Supplementary Fig.  3  illustrates that the removal of ocean biology fundamentally alters the seasonal cycle of the surface carbonate system. Firstly, the thermal-driven pCO 2  variability is amplified due to higher background pCO 2 18  and higher SST seasonal variation. Secondly, the lack of summer productivity and winter upwelling of remineralized carbon-rich deep water amplify the thermally driven pCO 2  variability. Thirdly, the indirect effect of land biosphere changes (stronger summer productivity and winter respiration) leads to an amplification of the atmospheric CO 2  seasonal cycle (Supplementary Fig.  3 a,d). These three effects combine to increase the air-sea pCO 2  gradient, with a stronger effect during winter, and manifest in a stronger high-latitude carbon sink in the  Abiotic  ocean (with up to a three-fold increase; Supplementary Fig.  3 c, f). We note that in our quasi-equilibrium preindustrial Abiotic ocean, the sedimentary carbon content is reduced by 391 Pg C (Table  1 ), due to the absence of organic matter accumulations and dissolution of organic materials. This additional DIC to the water column could contribute to the overall oceanic carbon release. We also note that our experiment represents an extreme hypothetical case with a complete absence of marine productivity. When we consider a 10% reduction in primary production, a range projected by models 19 , Supplementary Fig.  4  shows that the preindustrial atmospheric CO 2  would approximately be 10 ppm higher, while the land carbon budget increases by 9 Pg C, implying ocean outgassing of approximately 30 Pg C. Historical and future projections Projections of historical and future climate (1850–2100) show accelerated climate change in  Abiotic  relative to  REF  (Fig.  1  and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Atmospheric CO 2  in  REF  grows from 281 to 415 (SSP1-2.6), 569 (SSP2-4.5), and 1061 (SSP5-8.5) ppm by 2100 (Fig.  1 a and Supplementary Fig.  5 a), consistent with the CO 2  pathways defined in the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6) protocol 15 . In the  Abiotic , CO 2  increases from 445 to 685 (SSP1-2.6), 883 (SSP2-4.5), and 1433 (SSP5-8.5) ppm. The stronger CO 2  increase in the  Abiotic  (by 106, 150, and 208 ppm in SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively) is caused by the land and ocean carbon sinks diminishing by as much as 91% (i.e., land sink in SSP2-4.5). The weaker ocean carbon sink, despite higher atmospheric CO 2 , is attributed to the higher surface ocean pCO 2  and lower air-sea pCO 2  disequilibrium (Fig.  1 f). Figure  2  summarizes that without ocean biology, 68 to 83% of the fossil fuel emissions would remain in the atmosphere by 2100, as compared to only 37 to 65% in simulations that include ocean biology.

Fig. 2 Projected changes in the global carbon budget from 1850 to 2100. Shown are the initial CO 2  concentration at the start of the historical period (dark blue), cumulative release of fossil fuel emissions (yellow), net land sink (including land-use changes, green), net ocean sink (light blue), and the final CO 2  concentration at the end of the 21st century (red) in [ppm] units. The pie charts depict fractions [in percentage] of fossil fuel emissions taken up by the land, ocean, and atmosphere. Values are from  REF  and  Abiotic  simulations for ( a ,  b ) historical + SSP1-2.6, ( c ,  d ) historical + SSP2-4.5, and ( e ,  f ) historical + SSP5-8.5 scenarios. These larger anthropogenic CO 2  residuals being stored in the atmosphere translate to a stronger climate sensitivity by accelerating climate change in  Abiotic , with broad implications for various components of the Earth system (Fig.  1  and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Under SSP5-8.5, the global mean surface temperature in  Abiotic  increases by nearly 5 °C by 2100, a 30% stronger warming rate than in  REF  (Table  1 ). Regionally, the largest warming occurs at high latitudes, with approximately 2 °C additional warming in the Arctic due to polar amplification 20  (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Similarly, the AMOC strength, the sea-ice area, and the ocean mixed layer depth, are projected to decline faster in  Abiotic  (Fig.  1 c, g–i). A complete removal of ocean biology leads to the system crossing the 2 °C warming threshold more than ten years earlier, with the disappearance of summer Arctic sea ice occurring more than 50 years earlier (Fig.  1 b, g). This accelerated climate change is also evident in the lower emissions scenarios of SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 (Supplementary Table  2 ). The transient climate response to CO 2  emissions (TCRE) for the  REF  and  Abiotic  are 1.69 and 2.13 °C Eg C −1 , respectively (Supplementary Fig.  7 ), implying a 20% reduction of the allowable CO 2  emissions for a specified global warming target when ocean biology is removed. The reduced terrestrial carbon sinks in the  Abiotic  reflects the saturation of land carbon uptake in a warmer, higher CO 2  world due to the higher preindustrial vegetation carbon pool 21 , 22  (Fig.  1 e and Table  1 ), hence weakening the negative terrestrial carbon cycle feedback associated with CO 2  fertilization. In the ocean, warmer and higher surface pCO 2  reduces seawater CO 2  solubility and buffering capacity 23 , leading to a lower air-sea pCO 2  disequilibrium and less CO 2  uptake for a given increase in atmospheric CO 2  concentration (Fig.  1 d, f and Table  1 ). The lack of ocean production-induced pCO 2  deficit, which has significant impacts at higher atmospheric CO 2  levels, also plays an important role 24 . Next, we analyze how the spatio-temporal dynamics of the anthropogenic carbon ( C a n t ) sink and storage in the ocean are altered by the absence of ocean biology. The cumulative ocean uptake of  C a n t  (i.e., the difference between the transient historical + future and the preindustrial control simulations) over the 1850–2100 period is spatially heterogeneous, with deep water formation regions of the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean emerging as the most intense sink regions (Fig.  3 ). These key gateways for  C a n t  sinks allow for efficient transport of  C a n t -rich surface water to the interior for long-term storage 25 , 26 . Stronger uptake is simulated in the high-emission SSP5-8.5 than SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6, with regions of net  C a n t  outgassing (more prominently in  Abiotic ) are simulated in the subtropics, where surface  C a n t  converges 27 . The  Abiotic  Ocean absorbs considerably less  C a n t  than  REF  in the subpolar North Atlantic and parts of the Southern Ocean (Fig.  3 c, f, i). Fig. 3 Maps of ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon. Spatial patterns of cumulative (1850–2100) anthropogenic carbon uptake by the ocean under ( a ,  b ) historical + SSP1-2.6, ( d ,  e ) historical + SSP2-4.5, and ( g ,  h ) historical + SSP5-8.5 scenarios for  REF  and  Abiotic  simulations. Panels ( c ,  f ,  i ) depict differences between  REF  and  Abiotic  simulations. We investigate the driving mechanisms of the lower  Abiotic  C a n t  uptake, focusing in the subpolar North Atlantic (dashed green outlines in Fig.  3 c, f, i). Since the seasonal cycle of CO 2  fluxes is fundamentally altered in  Abiotic , we assess the projection of different drivers in each season (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). The air-sea gradient of pCO 2  determines to first order the direction of CO 2  flux. In  REF , the oceanic pCO 2  stays below the atmospheric values, and the subpolar North Atlantic is a net CO 2  sink all year, consistent with observations and models 28 . This is also seen in the  Abiotic  at the beginning of the historical period but is progressively altered by the faster oceanic pCO 2  growth rate, resulting in a remarkable decline in the CO 2  sink. More importantly, under SSP5-8.5 (and other scenarios) oceanic pCO 2  grows faster than atmospheric pCO 2  during spring and summer, therefore switching from uptake to outgassing. This is primarily driven by the combination of stronger warming and the higher initial surface Revelle factor, which reduce the  Abiotic  ocean capacity to offset the growing atmospheric pCO 2  (Supplementary Fig.  9 ), as depicted by the weaker surface DIC growth rate (Supplementary Fig.  8 )."
44,discussion,"Discussion Accurate assessment of the role of the marine ecosystem in regulating the Earth’s climate is challenging due to the non-linear interactions and feedback that link different components of the Earth system. Applying a fully interactive Earth system model, we show that a complete removal of marine ecosystems increases preindustrial atmospheric CO 2  by 163 ppm, at the lower end of the range estimate using atmosphere-ocean equilibrium relationship (150–240 ppm) 5 . A previous study using a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model, and thus excluding the land feedback, gave a greater increase of atmospheric CO 2  (> 200 ppm) after only 250 years 29 . In contrast, a theoretical study linking atmospheric CO 2  and the efficiency of BCP predicts only a 100 ppm increase when BCP is shut down 4 . In our simulations, the positive feedback due to climate warming as atmospheric CO 2  increases is overshadowed by negative feedback from the land biosphere, which absorbs nearly half of the released oceanic CO 2 . Nevertheless, there are other feedbacks that are not considered, such as (i) reduction in the biogenic marine dimethyl sulfide emissions, which act as aerosol cooling agents 30 , and (ii) warming-induced methane release from the permafrost 31 . These feedbacks would enhance warming-induced climate feedback, further increasing the preindustrial atmospheric CO 2  level. Therefore, our estimated climate impacts likely represent the lower end of the expected range. The reorganization of carbon pools within the Earth system alters the trajectories of anthropogenic climate change. The newly equilibrated abiotic ocean is warmer and contains less DIC. The absence of a biologically mediated vertical DIC gradient (Supplementary Fig.  10 ) leads to a higher surface pCO 2  and Revelle factor. This higher surface Revelle factor impedes the oceanic sink of anthropogenic CO 2 23 , implying that future changes in primary production may negatively affect anthropogenic CO 2  uptake. Similarly, the reallocation of carbon from the ocean to the land biosphere saturates the vegetation growth response to higher atmospheric CO 2 21 . Depending on the emissions scenario, the ocean and land CO 2  uptake in  Abiotic  could be reduced by up to 34% and 91%, respectively, increasing the cumulative airborne fraction of CO 2  emissions from 37%, 50%, 65% to 68%, 76%, 83% for the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Fig.  2 ). The projected climate change rate is therefore enhanced, particularly in the polar regions. Considering the lack of the above-mentioned feedback processes, these climate change figures are likely underestimated. This accelerated climate change also illustrates the potential consequence if the longevity of natural carbon sink is reduced faster or earlier than initially expected 32 . The simulated changes shown here represent extreme end-member examples of the role that ocean biology plays in controlling atmospheric CO 2 , both in the steady state and under greenhouse forcing. However, they are valuable and clearly show that estimates of the effects of biologically-mediated ocean CO 2  storage in the preindustrial has on atmospheric CO 2  based on simple metrics, i.e., integrated remineralised CO 2 , need to be treated with some cautions as any reduction in this term would likely lead to an enhanced terrestrial carbon sink. In addition, our simulations indicate that ocean biological processes play a crucial role in driving the uptake of  C a n t  in the modern ocean by adjusting the spatial and temporal patterns in the surface pCO 2  deficit. Our assessment of  C a n t  sequestration demonstrates that the largest impact of an abiotic ocean occurs in the ventilation regions of the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, where long-term surface-to-interior  C a n t  export is significantly reduced, particularly during summer, when the absence of biological export production and enhanced surface warming keep surface pCO 2  high (see Supplementary Fig.  9 ) and impede the ocean carbon sinks in the more stratified future ocean. Despite community consensus on the importance of ocean biology in the Earth system, its representations in state-of-the-art models are far from perfect. This leads to large uncertainty when simulating the observed CO 2  flux variability 33  and projecting future changes in ocean biology 7 , 19 , 34 . In Earth system models, the BCP is generally positively associated with surface primary productivity, nevertheless there is a nuanced relationship between primary production, carbon export, and carbon sequestration. Spatial and temporal variations in surface productivity and ecosystem structure may have non-linear impacts on BCP efficiency, complicating the direct links between reductions in productivity and CO 2  sequestration 35 . Addressing this complexity would be valuable to guide future climate modeling efforts, carbon cycle research, and policy development. Interdisciplinary research that integrates marine biological observations and models using various approaches to constrain the impacts of future global change should also be embraced 36 . Our finding also contradicts the current notion that the biological carbon pump plays little to no role in adsorbing excess  C a n t  from the atmosphere. Instead, it clearly plays an important role by setting up the disequilibria and Revelle factor conditions that determine the magnitude of this uptake. In order to optimize the service the ocean offers us by mitigating anthropogenic climate change, our results emphasize the importance of sustaining a healthy and well-functioning marine ecosystem. Our simulations, though extreme, suggest that the dissolution of sedimentary organic material can alter the water column DIC budget and, subsequently, the air-sea CO 2  fluxes. This has obvious parallels to human-induced disturbances of the seafloor by trawling or dredging; however, these will be much smaller in size, and hence future studies applying a more realistic scenario would be necessary to investigate the impact of human-induced disruption of marine sediments. In addition to improvements in various dynamical processes in the Earth system (cloud feedback, land carbon cycle, ocean circulation, albedo feedback, etc.), better representations of marine primary production and biological carbon pump should not be overlooked to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity and future climate projections. Future developments in ocean biogeochemistry models should emphasize improving the spatio-temporal biological processes in key ocean carbon sink regions (i.e., the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean). Sustained monitoring of marine biological carbon pumps would be necessary to improve our estimates of future ocean carbon sinks and, subsequently, the development of robust strategies for climate mitigation."

46,introduction,"Introduction Increased freshwater supply to the Arctic Ocean in a warming climate makes high-latitude regions susceptible to dramatic changes in ocean circulation. As anthropogenic warming continues in the 21st century, Arctic summer sea ice is likely to disappear in a few decades 1 , 2 , increasing the Arctic liquid freshwater storage. A stronger hydrological cycle in the atmosphere will also put more freshwater into the Arctic through an increase in net precipitation and river runoff 3 , 4 . Coupled climate models suggest that these extra freshwater sources to the Arctic will lead to a larger freshwater exportation to the subpolar North Atlantic in the 21st century 5 , 6 . The additional freshwater will increase ocean stratification and potentially slow down the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), with serious consequences for regional and global climates 7 – 10 . In this study, we focus on the influence of the extra freshwater from the Arctic on the ocean circulation in the Labrador Sea, a critical region for AMOC changes 11 – 14 . Climate models consistently project a slowdown of the AMOC during the 21st century due to warming and freshening in the high-latitude North Atlantic 15 – 17 . However, the overturning and deep convection responses to freshwater input are crucially impacted by the boundary current that typically circulates around open-ocean convection regions, where deep water forms. For example, there is significant freshwater input into the Weddell Sea, a key region for bottom water formation in the Southern Ocean, due to the melting of Antarctic ice sheet and sea ice. In the presence of a well-resolved Antarctic Slope Current, the extra freshwater largely stays on the shelf region as the slope current restricts the lateral spread of freshwater, with limited influence on open-ocean convection 18 . The Labrador Current can also restrict the lateral exchange of freshwater between the shelf and open ocean 19 , 20 . Thus, we hypothesize that when the extra freshwater enters the Labrador Sea from the Arctic through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago 21 , the Labrador Current restricts the freshwater from spreading into the open ocean and weakening the overturning circulation. Typical climate models for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) of Intergoverment Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report, mostly at 1° resolution, are unable to resolve the Labrador Current 22  (supplementary Fig.  1 ), and thus could overestimate overturning responses to the freshwater forcing due to anthropogenic warming 23 . Here, we study the role of the Labrador Current in regulating the overturning responses to an increased Arctic freshwater export in the Labrador Sea and its influence on AMOC changes in an unprecedented high-resolution coupled simulation over the 21st century (2006–2100) under the high-emission scenario (RCP8.5) from the CMIP5 protocol. The simulation (HighRes) 24  is conducted using the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), with a nominal horizontal resolution of 0.1° for the ocean, ~6.5 km in the Labrador Sea, and 0.25 o  for the atmosphere (see “CESM simulations” in “Method”). HighRes performs well in reproducing the narrow Labrador Current 25  (supplementary Fig.  1 ) and the Labrador Sea overturning circulation 26  (supplementary Fig.  2 ) when compared to observations. These processes are often biased in coarse-resolution climate models (supplementary Figs.  1  and  2 ). To quantify the role of the Labrador Current in regulating the overturning circulation changes, we also look at the overturning responses in a coarse-resolution counterpart of HighRes, LowRes, with a nominal 1° resolution as in most climate models in CMIP5 and CMIP6. HighRes and LowRes differ from each other primarily in their horizontal resolutions. We show that the well-resolved Labrador Current in HighRes strongly restricts freshwater to the shelf and leads to a much weaker response in the Labrador Sea overturning circulation than LowRes, in which the Labrador Current is poorly resolved. Thus, we conclude that, without resolving the Labrador Current, coarse-resolution climate models may overestimate the AMOC decline during the 21st century."
47,results,"Results Increased Arctic freshwater exportation into the Labrador Sea Consistent with climate models from CMIP6 6  and previous generations 5 , HighRes projects a significant increase in liquid freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean due to anthropogenic warming (Fig.  1a–c ). Under the RCP8.5 scenario in HighRes, the annual mean sea ice volume decreases by 98.5% from 16,298 km 3  in 2006–2015 to 243 km 3  in 2091–2100; summer sea ice is completely lost in the 2060s. Net precipitation and river runoff also increase significantly due to a stronger atmospheric hydrological cycle by ~161% and 39%, respectively. The larger Arctic freshwater input will necessarily lead to an increased liquid freshwater exportation into the subpolar North Atlantic, including the Labrador Sea. Fig. 1 Enhanced freshwater input into the Arctic Ocean and freshwater exportation into the Labrador Sea.

LC is the Labrador Current. WGC is the West Greenland Current. Time series of anomalous freshwater flux (FWF) into the Labrador Sea (defined as positive) from  e  the west of Greenland across Davis Strait (red line) and Hudson Strait (yellow line) and  f  from the east of Greenland. The freshwater flux anomaly is relative to the year 2006. The thin lines in  e  and  f  show the annual mean anomaly. The thick lines represent 20-year running mean. We estimate the freshwater transport into the Labrador Sea (Fig.  1d ) from the north across Davis Strait, from the west across Hudson Strait, and from the east by the West Greenland Current in HighRes (see “Freshwater flux” in “Method”). Salinity averaged in the Labrador Sea (denoted by the box in Fig.  1d ) in the year 2006 is used as the reference salinity. The increase in the freshwater flux from Davis Strait is most significant, at a rate of about 1.4 mSv yr −1  over the 21st century (Fig.  1e ). The freshwater flux across Hudson Strait also enhances with a smaller rate of 0.35 mSv yr −1  (Fig.  1e ). Both the trends are significant at the 95% confidence level according to a two-tailed Student’  t  test. The freshwater flux coming from the east weakly increases in 2020–2040 and decreases after the year 2040 (Fig.  1f ). The freshwater pathway into the Labrador Sea is determined by several processes, including the Arctic circulation and the location of freshwater sources. The differing freshwater flux trends between the western and the eastern routes are likely related to the structure of liquid freshwater increases in the Arctic Ocean in HighRes: liquid freshwater content increases in the Canadian basin but decreases in the Eurasian basin (supplementary Fig.  3 ). Surface freshening confined to the western shelf by the Labrador Current The extra freshwater in the Labrador Sea reduces sea surface salinity, but the freshening is mostly confined to the shelf close to Newfoundland and Labrador of Canada (Fig.  2a ). The freshening on the shelf is ~0.67 psu in 2091–2100 relative to 2006–2015. In contrast, in the interior Labrador Sea with depth deeper than 2000 m, where deep convection occurs, the surface freshening is only ~0.27 psu. We quantify the salinity changes along the Atlantic Repeat Hydrography Line 7 West line (AR7W line) 25  (black dashed line in Fig.  2a ). The freshening is most obvious in the upper 150 m on the shelf (Fig.  2b ). The exchange of freshwater between the shelf and the open ocean is strongly restricted by the narrow Labrador Current (Fig.  2b , supplementary Fig.  1 ), consistent with previous studies 19 , 20 . The Labrador Current may also help flush the freshwater out into the subpolar North Atlantic, contributing to reducing the freshening effects. Coarse-resolution models (e.g., LowRes), on the other hand, cannot fully resolve the Labrador Current, and thus may misrepresent the freshening of the interior Labrador Sea with excessive freshwater input from the shelf. Indeed, with similar increase in total freshwater flux that is mostly due to enhanced freshwater flux from the western route via Davis Strait and Hudson Strait (supplementary Fig.  4 ), the surface freshening is almost uniform in the Labrador Sea in LowRes, with a 1.52 psu decrease in the interior (Fig.  2c ). The broader surface salinity decrease is related to the too weak and wide Labrador Current (Fig.  2d , supplementary Fig.  1 ), which allows freshwater to enter the interior Labrador Sea. Thus, we suggest that the coarse-resolution CESM model overestimates the freshwater influence on surface salinity changes in the Labrador Sea. Fig. 2 Freshening of the Labrador Sea during the 21st century. a ,  c  Changes (2091–2100 minus 2006–2015) in sea surface salinity (SSS) in  a  HighRes and  c  LowRes. The black dashed line indicates the Atlantic Repeat Hydrography Line 7 West line (AR7W line).  b ,  d  Salinity changes (2091–2100 minus 2006–2015) along the AR7W line in  b  HighRes and  d  LowRes. The contour lines show velocity of currents across the AR7W line with interval of 12 cm s −1 . The dashed (solid) lines represent currents out of (into) the Labrador Sea. The Labrador Current also regulates ocean stratification and mixed layer depth (MLD) changes in the interior Labrador Sea due to surface freshening. Ocean stratification, quantified as the density difference between the sea surface and 1 km depth, increases by 91% from 2006–2015 to 2091–2100 in HighRes (supplementary Fig.  5 ). The strengthening is surface intensified and almost equally attributed to surface warming and freshening (Fig.  3a, b , supplementary Fig.  6 ). In contrast with HighRes, the upper-ocean stratification increases more dramatically in the 21st century by 158% in LowRes (supplementary Fig.  5 ). The larger stratification increase in LowRes can be mostly (~80%) attributed to the widespread surface freshening in the Labrador Sea that leads to a dramatic decrease in surface density (Fig.  3c, d , supplementary Fig.  6 ). Similar conclusions can be drawn for MLD changes (supplementary Fig.  7 ). In HighRes, the March MLD in the interior Labrador Sea decreases by 56% from 430 m in 2006–2015 to 190 m in 2091–2100. While in LowRes, the March MLD shoals by 91% from 928 m to 83 m during the same period. We note that the present-day MLD in LowRes is overestimated as in many coarse-resolution models 27 – 29 . The results highlight the role of the Labrador Current in future ocean stratification changes in the Labrador Sea and suggest that coarse-resolution models may overestimate the stratification increase due to freshwater forcing.

The temperature stratification,  N T 2 , is calculated as - gα 500m ( T 1000 m – T 0m )/1000, where  T  is the potential temperature and  α  is the thermal expansion coefficient. The haline stratification,  N S 2 , is calculated as  gβ 500m ( S 1000 m – S 0m )/1000, where  S  is salinity and  β  is the haline contraction coefficient. Only regions in the Labrador Sea (denoted by the box in Fig.  1d ) deeper than 2000 m are considered here. Response of the Labrador Sea overturning and the AMOC Through its impacts on surface freshening and stratification changes, the Labrador Current regulates overturning circulation changes in a warming climate. The stratification increase will decrease deep water formation in the Labrador Sea and potentially contribute to the AMOC weakening during the 21st century. We quantify the Labrador Sea overturning at the west leg of Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) observing system (Fig.  4a, c , see “OSNAP overturning streamfunction” in “Method”), at the exit of the Labrador Sea. The Labrador Sea overturning is weakened by ~55% in HighRes from 2006–2015 to 2091–2100. In comparison, the weakening of the Labrador Sea overturning in LowRes is more substantial by ~ 90% during the same period. The deep convection in LowRes almost completely shuts down at the end of the 21st century. The much stronger weakening of the Labrador Sea overturning in LowRes can be attributed to the overly stratified ocean in the Labrador Sea. We calculate the surface water mass transformation (SWMT), which is dynamically connected to the overturning 13 , 14 , 30 , using surface buoyancy flux and surface density (see “Surface water mass transformation” in “Methods” section). The SWMT largely reproduces the Labrador Sea overturning circulation as well as its changes during the 21st century (supplementary Fig.  8 ). Decomposing the SWMT changes into contributions due to changes in the surface buoyancy flux and surface density (see “Surface water mass transformation” in “Method”), we show that the differing Labrador Sea overturning responses between HighRes and LowRes are mainly owing to changes in surface density structure (supplementary Fig.  8 ). The surface buoyancy flux is not significantly different between HighRes and LowRes at 98% confidence level (supplementary Fig.  9 ) and cannot explain their difference in the overturning changes. Fig. 4 Weakening of Labrador Sea overturning and the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). a ,  c  Changes of overturning across the west leg of Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program observing system (OSNAP West) in  a  HighRes and  c  LowRes. Solid (dashed) lines indicate the mean in 2006–2015 (2091–2100). The percentage changes in the maximum overturning streamfunction between 2006–2015 and 2091–2100 is denoted on the upper-right corner in  a  and  c .  b ,  d  Percentage changes in the AMOC from 2006–2015 to 2091–2100 in  b  HighRes and  d  LowRes. The percentage changes are calculated as the AMOC streamfunction differences between 2091–2100 and 2006–2015, divided by the maximum AMOC at 40 o N in 2006–2015 in each simulation. The AMOC is calculated in density space and then remapped into depth space using the time and zonal mean depth of each density layer. The weakening of the Labrador Sea overturning circulation contributes to the AMOC decline during the 21st century. We calculate the North Atlantic overturning in density space and then remap it to depth space following previous studies 31 , 32  (see “Density-space AMOC” in “Method”, supplementary Fig.  10 ). Consistent with the Labrador Sea overturning circulation changes, the AMOC decline appears to be faster in LowRes (Fig.  4d ) than HighRes (Fig.  4b ). Overturning changes across OSNAP East, which dominates the North Atlantic overturning in observations, may also contribute to the faster AMOC decline in LowRes (supplementary Figs.  11  and  12 ). However, the difference in OSNAP East overturning changes between LowRes (53%) and HighRes (39%) is less dramatic as compared to OSNAP West (Fig.  4a, c )."
48,discussion,"Discussion In this study, we highlight the role of the Labrador Current in regulating the Labrador Sea responses to increased liquid freshwater input due to anthropogenic warming. The narrow Labrador Current strongly restricts the lateral exchange of freshwater between the continental shelf and open ocean. In the absence of this narrow boundary current, the extra freshwater input from the Arctic spreads into the open ocean and causes a much stronger increase in ocean stratification, leading to an overestimated weakening of the Labrador Sea overturning circulation. The impact of the Labrador Current in restricting lateral freshwater exchange might evolve as the climate continues to warm. HighRes predicts a weakening of the Labrador Current due to surface wind changes (supplementary Fig.  13 ), suggesting a slightly diminishing role of the Labrador Current in the future climate. Nevertheless, given that the Labrador Sea overturning circulation makes a significant contribution to the AMOC in many climate models of coarse resolution 27 – 29 , our results suggest that the AMOC weakening may be overestimated in these climate models. A similar dependence of the AMOC decline rate on model resolutions has been found in GFDL models 33 . However, the overturning responses to anthropogenic forcing are complex and involve many processes (e.g., ice sheet melting) that are not resolved even in the high-resolution CESM. Our discussions are mostly based on one single climate model under the previous CMIP5 protocol. It is possible that the dependence of the AMOC decline rate on model resolution is model-dependent. In this regard, HighResMIP 34  may be useful for a more comprehensive comparison of AMOC decline among various climate models. However, the high-resolution models in HighResMIP, mostly based on NEMO ocean model 35 , 36 , only partially resolve the boundary current at 0.25 o  resolution and simulate the climate until year 2050, beyond which the AMOC decline is more significant 15 , 16 . High-resolution projections with various model configurations until 2100 are highly desired to validate our results and enable a more comprehensive understanding of the AMOC changes during the 21st century. As anthropogenic warming continues, more freshwater is expected to enter the subpolar North Atlantic from the Greenland ice sheet melting and Arctic freshwater release. The extra freshwater input will necessarily interact with deep convection and cause a slowdown of the AMOC 37 – 39 . However, our results suggest that future AMOC responses will be sensitive to how the extra freshwater input is distributed in the high-latitude regions. To address this question, we need to monitor the freshwater sources and their exportation pathways through Arctic-subpolar North Atlantic gateways towards regions that could impact the AMOC. High-resolution models are also desired for a more accurate representation of freshwater transports associated with narrow boundary currents 40 – 43  and oceanic eddies 44 – 47  that are not resolved in coarse-resolution models."

54,introduction,"Introduction The role of ocean circulation in the global carbon cycle and climate is a complex interplay of physical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes 1 , 2 . To grow, phytoplankton require sunlight, inorganic carbon, large relative quantities of macronutrients, such as nitrate and phosphate, as well as much smaller amounts of micronutrients, such as iron. A fraction of the organic matter produced in the surface ocean forms sinking particles (""marine snow”) that are gradually broken down with depth by bacteria in the intermediate- and deep-ocean, releasing their constituents back into the seawater 3 . These resources are returned to the surface over long timescales as part of the global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), the network of deep-ocean and surface currents that traces water masses on a continuous circuit of the global ocean 4 . The MOC can be conceptualized as two connected cells: (a) the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is driven by sinking of dense waters in the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic, and (b) the Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation (SMOC), which is comprised of dense bottom water sinking adjacent to Antarctica. Dense watermass transformation and upwelling in the Indian and Pacific Oceans due to turbulent mixing begins the journey back towards the upper ocean 4 . These oldest waters carry the highest concentrations of remineralized carbon and nutrients. Both cells are ulimately connected back to the surface, and the atmosphere, by Southern Ocean upwelling driven by strong westerly winds, air-sea heat fluxes, and freshwater exchanges. The strength of the Atlantic and Southern Ocean MOC cells are similar in magnitude, approximately 20 Sv 5 . Unlike lower latitudes, where macronutrients and inorganic carbon are generally rapidly depleted by biological activity near the surface, high concentrations of macronutrients and inorganic carbon are sustained in the Southern, Equatorial and Northern Pacific Oceans as a consequence of local biological limitation by lack of other resources such as light and/or the micronutrient iron 6 . Iron is not very soluble in seawater 7  and may be rapidly lost from solution by precipitation or by scavenging, that is adsorption onto sinking particles 8 . Therefore older upwelled waters are typically low in iron, having been exposed to prolonged iron depletion processes. In addition, the remote Southern Ocean receives little external iron input from atmospheric dust or continental sources 9 . Thus, upwelled macronutrients in the Southern Ocean, Equatorial, and North Pacific, are incompletely consumed, while the accompanying upwelled inorganic carbon may escape from the ocean, promoting higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels. Changing the strength of the MOC, and the Southern Ocean upwelling that connects the deep ocean inorganic carbon store to the atmosphere has long been identified as a key driver of past climatic changes such as the glacial-interglacial cycles 10 – 15 : slowing upwelling and reducing delivery of inorganic carbon and macronutrients to the Southern Ocean surface is thought to enable more complete resource consumption by microbes limited by iron and light, therefore lowering the evasion of upwelled CO 2  to the atmosphere. Increased Antarctic aeolian dust deposition 16  could have further enhanced Southern Ocean nutrient consumption during glacial periods 17 . Conversely, increasing upwelling enhances the Southern Ocean surface supply of inorganic carbon and macronutrients from the abyss, reduces the extent of Southern Ocean resource consumption by iron- and light-limited microbes, and promotes CO 2  outgassing. Early modelling studies highlighting the role of the Southern Ocean and its effect on atmospheric CO 2  [e.g., refs.  10 – 13 ] did not explicitly include iron cycling in their idealized box models. Nevertheless, more recent simulations that do include iron cycling still arrive at essentially the same result [e.g., refs.  1 , 2 , 18 ]: change in atmospheric CO 2  is proportional to change in MOC strength. Over 99% of oceanic iron is associated with metal-complexing organic molecules, collectively known as ligands 19 – 23 , that protect dissolved iron from loss by scavenging 8 . The diverse, incompletely characterised, ligand pool consists of siderophores, exuded polysaccharides, porphyrins, degraded protein remnants, and humic substances 24 . Ligands are produced by the growth and decay of marine microbes, which in turn depends on iron concentrations, establishing a reinforcing feedback loop 22  in which the creation of ligands by microbial activity stabilizes a greater quantity of iron, which may accumulate rather than be lost by scavenging. More available iron enables further uptake of nutrients for growth, additional ligand production, and enhanced iron accumulation. The feedback is arrested when another resource, such as light or macronutrients, becomes limiting. This coupling between biology and trace metal availability has not been considered in numerical model studies of changing MOC and Southern Ocean upwelling on ocean-atmosphere carbon partitioning. How does atmospheric CO 2  respond to changes in Southern Ocean upwelling and coupled feedbacks within the ocean carbon, macronutrient, and iron cycles? I present a suite of idealized box model simulations of ocean circulation, trace metal biogeochemistry, and carbon cycling [refs.  25 , 26 , Methods] in the spirit of the influential idealized models employed previously 10 – 13 . Within this framework, I can quantify the effect of dynamic ligand concentrations on atmospheric CO 2  as a result of increasing or decreasing MOC strength."
55,results,"Results Sensitivity of atmospheric pCO 2  to MOC strength The first model ensemble has no feedback between biological activity and trace metal cycling, with ligand concentrations fixed at a uniform global concentration representative of the modern ocean [2 nmol kg −1 , 27 ]. This results in the recognisable positive relationship between Southern Ocean upwelling and atmospheric CO 2  across a broad range of overturning rates (Fig.  1 a) from a weak MOC with 8.0 Sv of Southern Ocean upwelling to a vigorous double-strength circulation of 40.0 Sv Southern Ocean upwelling. The increase in atmospheric pCO 2  amounts to 19  μ atm across a realistic range of AMOC transports at the last glacial maximum [8.0–25.0 Sv, e.g., refs.  28 – 32 . At Southern Ocean upwelling less than 8.0 Sv, approaching MOC collapse, the system enters a different regime that will not be considered here, where slow transports of inorganic carbon and nutrients between the deep ocean and the surface create a highly isolated abyssal inorganic carbon store. At 8.0 Sv, the vast deep Pacific Ocean is ventilated by a net transport of only 1.6 Sv (Methods), creating a residence time on the order of 10 kyrs that effectively traps inorganic carbon and nutrients, leading to decline in atmospheric pCO 2  of ~ 50–60  μ atm, irrespective of surface macro- or micronutrient limitation. In the second model ensemble, the same experiments are repeated, this time enabling the feedback between biological activity and the iron cycle via emergent organic ligand concentrations (Methods 22 ). The net result is elevated atmospheric pCO 2  at low MOC and lower atmospheric pCO 2  with strong MOC (Fig.  1 b)—the opposite relationship to the ensemble with fixed ligand concentration equating to a 52  μ atm decrease in atmospheric pCO 2  across a realistic range of AMOC transports at the last glacial maximum [8.0–25.0 Sv, e.g., refs.  28 – 32 ]. The inverted MOC-atmospheric pCO 2  relationship with dynamic ligand concentrations is robust to large changes in Southern Hemisphere aeolian iron deposition 17 , illustrated by the shaded region in Fig.  1 .

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Oceanic response to MOC changes with fixed and dynamic ligands A sluggish MOC with low Southern Ocean upwelling is most commonly associated with cool glacial climates 14 , 15 . Under current thinking, with fixed ligand concentration and no feedback, reducing the strength of the MOC (Fig.  1 A) from the 20.0 Sv control to a weak 8.0 Sv decreases the upwelling supply of macronutrients and iron to the surface Southern Ocean (Fig.  2 , and Supplementary Figs.  S1 ,  2) . Macronutrient abundance in the Southern Ocean (Fig.  2 A) remains roughly the same, 24.0  μ mol N kg −1  compared to 22.6  μ mol N kg −1  in the control (Methods), even though biological activity declines by nearly 69%, indicating significantly more efficient nutrient consumption. In the Pacific there is a similar change, with 39% reduced biological production coupled to lower AABW upwelling, resulting in decreased macronutrient concentrations (17.4  μ mol N kg −1  compared to 21.6  μ mol N kg −1  in the control). Global nutrient use efficiency (see Methods) increases 13%, preventing more upwelled inorganic carbon from outgassing, lowering atmospheric CO 2  levels from 280  μ atm to 266  μ atm. The Surface Southern Ocean and Pacific Oceans remain iron-limited as micronutrient concentrations are drawn down to low levels (Fig.  2 B), inhibiting the further uptake of remaining inorganic carbon. Lower MOC strength also reduces the upper-ocean delivery of nitrate from the Southern and Pacific Oceans to the macronutrient-limited Atlantic Ocean. Nitrate concentrations are still fully drawn down in the Atlantic Ocean, but the 65% lower biological activity due to heightened macronutrient limitation means less iron consumption, increasing the local standing stock by 1.54 nmol Fe kg −1  (nearly 7 × ). Excess iron is exported to the Deep Atlantic, which also receives hydrothermal iron input but, although provided protection by the 2 nmol L kg −1  constant ligand concentration, is subsequently partially lost by scavenging due to slower transit in the AMOC resulting in overall average deep ocean iron concentrations declining from 0.71 nmol Fe kg −1  to 0.63 nmol Fe kg −1 . Lower deep ocean iron concentration and slower MOC reduce the Southern Ocean upwelling iron supply, enhancing surface iron limitation and thus constraining the extent of macronutrient and inorganic carbon consumption in the Southern and Pacific Oceans, limiting atmospheric CO 2  reduction. Fig. 2 Steady-state results for model simulations with weak Southern Ocean upwelling strength (8.0 Sv). Ligand levels are represented as fixed, uniform concentrations (left column), or are allowed to dynamically vary (right column). Concentrations are ( A ,  D ) nitrate ( μ mol N kg −1 ), ( B ,  E ) iron (nmol Fe kg −1 ), and ( C ,  F ) organic ligands (nmol L kg −1 ). Black arrows indicate the overturning circulation between boxes representing the Surface Atlantic (SA), Surface Southern (SS), Surface Pacific (SP), Deep Atlantic (DA), Deep Southern (DS), and Deep Pacific (DP) Oceans. Boxes are not drawn to scale in the vertical. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Alternatively, when these experiments are repeated with dynamic ligand concentrations, Southern Ocean macronutrient levels increase to 28.7  μ mol N kg −1  (Fig.  2 D, and Supplementary Figs.  S3 ,  4)  from 17.5  μ mol N kg −1 , and the Southern Ocean is ultimately a source of CO 2  to the atmosphere. This is because reduced nutrient upwelling causes a 92% reduction in biological activity, resulting in a decline in organic ligand concentration from 3.33 nmol L kg −1  to 0.34 nmol L kg −1  (Fig.  2 F). Similarly, in the Pacific, a 58% decline in biological activity due to reduced nutrient supply results in a decline in ligand concentration from 0.72 nmol L kg −1  to 0.23 nmol L kg −1 . Without sufficient protection by complexation with ligands, scarce iron is significantly scavenged and lost (Fig.  2 E), resulting in the Southern and Pacific Ocean surface boxes experiencing heightened iron limitation and accumulation of unused macronutrients. There is a 15% overall decline in the extent of nutrient usage, which leads to greater inorganic carbon outgassing from the ocean, driving atmospheric CO 2  levels upwards from 280  μ atm to 310  μ atm. Biological activity in the Atlantic Ocean is reduced by 53% and becomes co-limited by iron as well as nitrate, due to low ligand and, therefore, iron concentrations, as well as net reduced macronutrient supply from the Southern and Pacific Oceans (concentration increases, but MOC transport decreases). Finally, with very low ligand concentration, hydrothermal iron input to the deep ocean is heavily scavenged, resulting in deep ocean iron concentration falling from 1.00 nmol Fe kg −1  to 0.33 nmol Fe kg −1 . Thus, there is much less iron supply in Southern Ocean upwelling, reinforcing inefficient nutrient consumption and promoting further evasion of CO 2  from the ocean to the atmosphere. The sign of atmosphere-ocean carbon partitioning, under fixed and dynamic ligand scenarios, is reversed when the strength of the MOC and Southern Ocean upwelling is doubled from 20.0 Sv in the control to 40.0 Sv (Fig.  3 ). Fig. 3 Steady-state results for model simulations with strong Southern Ocean upwelling strength (40.0 Sv). Ligand levels are represented as fixed, uniform concentrations (left column), or are allowed to dynamically vary (right column). Concentrations are ( A ,  D ) nitrate ( μ mol N kg −1 ), ( B ,  E ) iron (nmol Fe kg −1 ), and ( C ,  F ) organic ligands (nmol L kg −1 ). Black arrows indicate the overturning circulation between boxes representing the Surface Atlantic (SA), Surface Southern (SS), Surface Pacific (SP), Deep Atlantic (DA), Deep Southern (DS), and Deep Pacific (DP) Oceans. Boxes are not drawn to scale in the vertical. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. For the model with prescribed ligand concentrations, increasing the rate of upwelling of deep ocean inorganic carbon, macronutrients, and iron to the Surface Southern Ocean increases biological activity by 2 × as a consequence of macronutrient delivery and iron supply from deep-ocean hydrothermal vents, supported by fixed ligand concentrations in excess of the average ~ 0.70 nmol Fe kg −1  in the deep ocean. However, the Southern and Pacific Oceans remain iron-limited, so surface macronutrient concentrations remain high (22.3  μ mol N kg −1  and 22.6  μ mol N kg −1 , respectively, compared to 22.6  μ mol N kg −1  and 21.6  μ mol N kg −1  in the control, Fig.  3 A), causing the Southern Ocean to remain a source of CO 2  to the atmosphere. Unused Southern Ocean and Pacific macronutrients exported into the Atlantic Ocean are partially consumed, causing a 32% increase in biological production. However, surface iron concentrations become exhausted (declining from 0.27 nmol Fe kg −1  to 0.00 nmol Fe kg −1 , Fig.  3 B) before complete resource consumption, which allows accumulation of surface North Atlantic nitrate and inorganic carbon. The Atlantic Ocean transition from macronutrient limitation to iron limitation triggers acceleration of atmospheric CO 2  increase (Fig.  1 A). Inefficient global nutrient and inorganic carbon consumption (a decline in completeness of macronutrient use of 17%) leads to greater ocean carbon outgassing, increasing atmospheric pCO 2  levels from 280  μ atm to 323  μ atm. When ligand concentrations are dynamic, on the other hand, the Southern Ocean becomes a sink of atmospheric CO 2 . Productivity in the Southern and Pacific Oceans is enhanced 4 and 5 × , respectively, due to the increased upwelling of nutrients and iron from the deep ocean, which leads to the generation and transport of additional organic ligands, increasing global average concentrations to over 6.0 nmol L kg −1  (Fig.  3 F). Substantially greater protection from loss by scavenging increases the standing stock of bioavailable iron, especially in the deep ocean, from 1.00 nmol Fe kg −1  to 1.97 nmol Fe kg −1  (Fig.  3 E). On upwelling into the Southern and Pacific Oceans, the enhanced supply of chelated iron from the deep ocean more than compensates for the greater delivery of macronutrients to the surface, resulting in a significant drawdown of both resources (Fig.  3 D, E). Nitrate concentration in the surface Southern Ocean decreases from 17.50  μ mol N kg −1  in the control to 1.86  μ mol N kg −1 , while concentrations in the Pacific decline from 19.5  μ mol N kg −1  in the control to 0.15  μ mol N kg −1 , increasing the extent of consumption globally to ~ 100%, which prevents upwelled inorganic carbon from outgassing and results in lowering atmospheric CO 2  from 280  μ atm to 189  μ atm, close to the lower bound of atmospheric pCO 2  due to bioligcical activity calculated in ref.  11 . Nitrate transport to the North Atlantic significantly declines, enhancing local macronutrient limitation and decreasing biological production by 61%. Excess iron from the Atlantic Ocean is transported into the Deep Atlantic, where it accumulates with additional iron from hydrothermal sources protected by elevated ligand concentrations. This eventually upwells in the Southern Ocean, reinforcing complete nutrient and inorganic carbon consumption. Including the feedback between biological activity, organic chelating ligand abundance, and iron availability decouples atmospheric pCO 2  anomalies from MOC strength and Southern Ocean upwelling changes in this model. Instead of the positive functional relationship established in models that omit the cycling of iron or that include iron cycling with fixed, uniform ligand concentrations, including dynamic ligand concentrations produces a negative relationship between MOC strength and atmospheric CO 2  levels as a result of interaction between biological activity driven by nutrient delivery rates in the Southern and Pacific Oceans, emergent ligand concentrations, and the bioavailable standing stock of dissolved iron. Robustness of the MOC–atmospheric CO 2  relationship Changes in external aeolian dust deposition to the Southern Ocean are hypothesized to significantly increase iron supply during glacial periods, stimulating iron-limited biological production in the Southern Ocean to consume unused nutrients and trap CO 2  in the ocean more efficiently 17 . Conversely, more humid conditions projected for the future climate reduce the aeolian iron flux 9  and could lead to enhanced ocean CO 2  outgassing 33 . The experiments with fixed and dynamic ligands were repeated with Southern Hemisphere surface iron flux increased or decreased by 20 ×  9 . At low MOC strength with both fixed and dynamic ligands, elevated Southern Hemisphere surface iron deposition partially relieves Southern Ocean iron limitation (Fig.  2 b, e) and enables further macronutrient consumption, resulting in an additional atmospheric CO 2  drawdown of between 10 and 20  μ atm as hypothesized (Fig.  1 ,  Supplementary Information  and Figs.  S1 – 4) , but low light and low ligand abundance to support significantly higher iron concentrations prevent further CO 2  uptake. Overall, the dynamic ligand feedback is the primary factor affecting atmospheric CO 2  levels, with the “iron hypothesis” 17  playing a secondary, additional role in sluggish MOC scenarios. Paleoclimate observations and simulations provide inconclusive evidence regarding the strength and depth-extent of the AMOC during the last glacial maximum [e.g., refs.  29 , 30 , 32 , 34 – 38 ]. The standard simulations have a fixed interface between the surface and deep Atlantic of 100 m, equivalent to the depth of the euphotic zone. The main result of opposing MOC-atmospheric pCO 2  correlations with fixed and dynamic ligand concentrations is robust to a significant change in the depth of the Surface Atlantic from 100 m to 2000 m ( Supplementary Information , and Figs.  S5 – 8) , which affects Atlantic Ocean residence times. For fixed ligand concentrations, this results in higher iron accumulation and reduced ocean carbon outgassing, while with dynamic ligand concentration, this leads to increased ligand degradation, lower iron availability, and reduced ocean carbon uptake in the Southern and Pacific Oceans, particularly at strong Southern Ocean upwelling rates. The model uses prescribed transports 13 , 39 , which implicitly include the effects of both advection by the MOC and fluxes due to turbulent mixing. The latter fluxes are relatively uncertain for the modern ocean and may have been more intense during glacial times due to enhanced tidal mixing [e.g., ref.  40 ]. An additional exchange of 3.0 Sv ( ~ 15% of control Southern Ocean upwelling strength) between adjacent boxes was applied ( Supplementary Information , and Figs.  S9 – 12) , which does not significantly change the different MOC-atmospheric pCO 2  relationships, although at low Southern Ocean upwelling strengths, mixing is a significant continued source of nutrients and iron to the surface ocean, which results in enhanced ocean carbon uptake with fixed ligand concentration and reduced ocean carbon outgassing with dynamic ligand concentrations. The maximum rate of biological production associated with the availability of macro- and micronutrients is a key factor in driving the production of ligands and, therefore, the overall availability of dissolved iron. When the maximum biological production rate is perturbed by ± 50% ( Supplementary Information , Figs.  S13 ,  14) , there is no real change in atmospheric CO 2  compared to the standard simulations, indicating that the control run is producing emergent biological activity rates and concentration distributions based on nutrient limitation rather than artificially limited by parameter constraints. However, approaching MOC perturbations of double the control MOC (i.e., Southern Ocean upwelling strength around 40.0 Sv), atmospheric CO 2  anomalies are slightly sensitive to a decrease in the maximum biological production rate parameter, where ligand production and iron abundance are lower, and surface nutrients are not as completely consumed. The lifetime of ligands is also an important control on iron availability, macronutrient usage, and ocean inorganic carbon storage. With a 25% increase or decrease in degradation timescale (1/ λ  = 283.0 ± 71.0 years) there are more significant changes in the resulting atmospheric pCO 2 , up to 33  μ atm more uptake and up to 48  μ atm more outgassing, respectively ( Supplementary Information , Figs.  S15 ,  16) . These lifetimes are consistent with the O(100) year residence time of partially-labile and semi-refractory dissolved organic carbon 41  and ligands in deep waters of the Atlantic 42 , 43 . Higher ligand lifetime increases the model parameter ratio  γ / λ  from the data-optimized value of 4398.0 s to 5497.5 s, shifting the system towards an “iron-replete, macronutrient limited” regime 22 , accumulating a larger pool of ligands due to slower rates of decay across all MOC strengths. Longer-lived ligands support a greater availability of iron, resulting in a more complete drawdown of surface macronutrients, particularly in the iron-limited Southern and Pacific Oceans. In contrast, decreasing ligand lifetime lowers the model  γ / λ  ratio from the data-optimized value of 4398.0 s to 3298.5 s, shifting the system towards an “iron-limited, macronutrient replete” regime 22 . More rapid ligand decay reduces ligand standing stock and lowers the overall availability of iron, resulting in less complete macronutrient consumption in the Surface Southern and Pacific Oceans, again across all MOC strengths. Even though the gradient of the MOC-atmospheric pCO 2  relationship is sensitive to perturbations in the ligand lifetime, a negative overall correlation remains robust."
56,discussion,"Discussion Biological activity in the ocean has a strong influence on ocean-atmosphere carbon partitioning and atmospheric pCO 2 , which is intimately tied to rates of surface delivery and efficient consumption of macronutrients, such as nitrate and phosphate, as well as micronutrients, such as the trace metal iron, in the Southern Ocean. The biogeochemistry and bioavailability of micronutrients, in turn, may be influenced by the activity of microbes through the maintenance of a pool of organic chelating ligands that protect dissolved iron against loss by scavenging. Simulations of an idealized ocean biogeochemistry model demonstrate that the functional relationship between the MOC, Southern Ocean upwelling, and atmospheric pCO 2  can be fundamentally different depending on whether the organic ligand pool is fixed, or dynamically coupled to biological activity through the growth and decay of microbes. In an ocean with constant ligand concentration, efficient nutrient consumption, and atmospheric CO 2  drawdown is attained when the global MOC and Southern Ocean upwelling are slowed to reduce the delivery of inorganic carbon- and macronutrient-rich waters to the surface and limit the escape of CO 2  to the atmosphere. In contrast, in an ocean with dynamic ligand concentrations coupled to biological activity, a weak MOC results in decreased ligand production, scarce iron availability, and inefficient nutrient consumption, resulting in ocean carbon outgassing. A vigorous global MOC with an enhanced supply of nutrients to the surface stimulates biological production and generates more ligands, enabling plentiful iron availability, resulting in efficient nutrient consumption as well as significantly reducing atmospheric pCO 2 . This result is an independent mechanism from the glacial “iron hypothesis” 17 , which invokes changes in external aeolian iron supply to the Southern Ocean in order to consume excess nutrients and prevent Southern Ocean CO 2  outgassing. An increase in deep ocean inorganic carbon storage and more vigorous MOC could be compatible with the proxy record. Paleoceanographic evidence indicates more deep ocean biogenic carbon storage during the last glacial maximum [e.g., refs.  44 – 47 ], as well as more complete Southern Ocean nutrient utilization [e.g., refs.  15 , 46 , 48 – 51 ]. Still, the proxy records for ocean productivity 52  and past strength and configuration of the MOC are ambiguous 37 , 53 . For example, the change in the distribution of stable isotopes of carbon ( δ 13 C) has been interpreted as a more sluggish MOC, with much less Southern Ocean upwelling during the last glacial maximum to trap isotopically-light carbon in the deep Southern Ocean [e.g., ref.  54 ]. However, the existence of well-defined gradients in the presence of more intense glacial tidal mixing [e.g., refs.  40 ] could instead suggest more vigorous deep ocean circulation 55 , 56 . Ocean models forced by paleoclimate boundary conditions have a broad range of responses for the AMOC 57 – 60 , that should be interpreted with caution [e.g., ref.  61 ] but tend towards a stronger and slightly deeper glacial AMOC in latest results from phase 4 of the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project [PMIP4, 30 ]. Models that explicitly carry tracers representing multiple proxies also support varying conclusions about AMOC strength and the depth of the interface between the AMOC and SMOC 29 , 32 , 34 – 36 , 38 , as well as ocean models that produce glacial state-estimates by quantitatively assimilating paleoceanographic observations 45 , 62 – 64 . According to results from the model with variable ligand concentrations, a slower glacial MOC [e.g., refs.  28 , 35 , 65 , 66 ] demands other processes to achieve lower atmospheric CO 2 , such as iron fertilization 17  and extended Antarctic sea ice 67 – 69  to compensate for circulation-driven outgassing caused by low ligand and iron abundance. Current changes in the MOC are also uncertain. Observational trends could indicate a slow down of the AMOC 70 , but may be within the bounds of natural variability 71 . Changes in SMOC might also represent a trend or natural variability 72 , 73 . Future climate change projections do suggest a potential decline in the MOC between a half to one-third by 2100 74 , which may be reinforced by poorly-represented Antarctic meltwater forcing 75 , 76 . The predicted decline in the global MOC already threatens the ocean’s ameliorating effects on climate due to declining anthropogenic CO 2  uptake 77 , but it could be further impeded if the MOC-ligand interplay detailed here is important, resulting in enhanced Southern Ocean natural carbon outgassing and accelerated atmospheric warming. The global Earth System Models used for these future climate projections do not routinely include the dynamic feedback between biological activity, ligand abundance, iron biogeochemistry, and the ocean carbon cycle explored here [e.g., refs.  78 – 83 ]. However, this is an idealized model, both in terms of simplified geometry and in capturing diverse processes that govern oceanic trace metal cycles, although the negative MOC-atmospheric pCO 2  correlation is robust to large changes in Southern Hemisphere surface iron input, reconfiguration of Atlantic circulation, mixing rates, maximum biological production rate, and prescribed ligand lifetime ( Supplementary Information) . The treatment of iron cycling neglects colloidal and particulate phases of iron [e.g., ref.  84 ], parameterizes a generalized iron input rather than separating aeolian, sedimentary, riverine, glacial, and recycled sources [e.g., refs.  85 – 88 ], and carries a single dynamic pool of ligands without external sources rather than explicitly capturing varied pools like siderophores or terrestrially-derived humic substances that can also bind with iron 23 , 89 , 90 . Siderophores constitute a small fraction of ocean iron ligands [e.g., ref.  24 ] and may be produced by bacteria under iron stress to competitively capture iron, which could reduce the impact of the ligand-iron feedback. A similar framework of ligand cycling was extended with a second siderophore-type ligand in a box model 23 , but the reinforcing feedback described here remained the dominant mechanism, rather than being largely damped as would be expected from siderophore-dominated ligand pool. Uncertainty in the first-order impact of the MOC on the ocean-atmosphere carbon balance is a challenge to our understanding of the Earth system, particularly with regards to causes of glacial–interglacial CO 2  changes and climate cycles. This challenge still holds true even if the unexplored processes in this idealized model turn out to robustly decrease the slope of the dynamic ligand MOC-atmospheric pCO 2  relationship (Fig.  1 b) to leave a weak correlation between the ocean’s MOC and the atmosphere CO 2 . Beyond external iron fertilization 17 , these results suggest that dynamic, emergent feedbacks between ocean circulation, biological activity, and the marine iron cycle may be vital in shaping the ocean’s response to climate and should be more wholly represented in the next generation of Earth System Models."

58,discussion,"Discussion We provide estimates of the AMOC carbon feedback and find an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon flux changes. This allows us to make projections for a range of CMIP6 models, whose ScenarioMIP output currently does not capture the AMOC carbon feedback because of being forced by CO 2  concentrations instead of CO 2  emissions ( 54 ). As a second contribution, we incorporate this relationship into an IAM, with which we explore the economic impacts of the AMOC carbon feedback. This yields SCC changes of a magnitude that could flip economic impact assessments of AMOC weakening from a global benefit into a global cost. Both parts of our study are subject to uncertainties and limitations. The estimates of AMOC-induced carbon flux changes rest on our simulations with the MPI-ESM model. Some features of the ocean and carbon cycle dynamics would likely be different in equivalent simulations with other ESMs, for example the late intensification of carbon uptake reductions in the 1pct experiment ( Fig. 3  and  SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). This implies that the CI of our regression coefficient might not be capturing the full amount of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the fact that multimodel evidence from CMIP6 carbon cycle feedback experiments as well as other hosing-based studies ( 28 ) yield similar results increases confidence in the dynamics and magnitude of our findings. The economic impact estimation is also subject to uncertainties as well as normative and structural modeling choices ( 10 ). As demonstrated by many studies, the SCC is very sensitive to choices of discounting and damage function parameters ( 4 ,  55 – 58 ). Our absolute SCC values, as well as the additional damages we estimate, are equally sensitive to these parameter choices ( SI Appendix , Table S4 ). For this reason, we focus on the relative change in SCC as our main outcome variable. While the absolute SCC value can change drastically, the relative SCC impact of including the AMOC carbon feedback is more robust to alternative discounting and damage function parameters ( SI Appendix , Table S4 ). Of all the possible impacts of AMOC weakening, the literature has so far only included a single one: the change in surface temperature patterns, which is dominated by Northern Hemisphere cooling. Here, we add a second important mechanism that acts through the impact of AMOC weakening on the carbon cycle. By considering a single additional mechanism through which AMOC weakening might affect the economy, we find SCC changes that might flip the sign of the overall effect. But there are many more potential impacts of AMOC weakening, such as changes in precipitation, sea level, or North Atlantic storm tracks. Therefore, our results should not be interpreted as an impact estimate of AMOC weakening as such, but rather as the second step of a long journey toward assessing the full economic consequences of AMOC weakening. Recent studies have been warning about the possibility of a complete AMOC collapse ( 14 ,  59 ,  60 ), a scenario which we do not cover in this study. Our results are conservative, as they are based on SSP2-4.5 AMOC projections from CMIP6 models—none of which feature AMOC collapse. Using the same scenario across all parts of this study is important for the internal consistency of our results, but it should be noted that, in the event of stronger AMOC weakening than projected by current models, SCC impacts would increase considerably."
59,materials|methods,"Materials and Methods ESM Simulations. Freshwater hosing. We perform freshwater hosing experiments in the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model ( 39 ). There are two common ways of introducing the freshwater flux (implemented as a negative salinity flux) in these experiments ( 43 ): either as a uniform field across the whole Atlantic north of 50Â°N or as a field around Greenland that decays exponentially with distance to the coast. While Greenland hosing is arguably the more realistic setup, uniform hosing fields are more common in the literature; we therefore run both types of hosing patterns. For both patterns, we use different hosing strengths, corresponding to freshwater fluxes of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 Sv, respectively. Given that 0.1 Sv is already on the higher end of estimates of expected input from future Greenland ice sheet melting, these hosing experiments should not be interpreted as a realistic freshwater forcing, but rather as a means for generating internally consistent model worlds that span a wide range of AMOC strengths. CO 2  forcing. In contrast to the hosing simulations studied in ref.  43 , which are conducted against the background of preindustrial climate conditions, we apply anthropogenic CO 2  forcing. We do that in two different experimental setups. In the first setup, we run one set of simulations where atmospheric CO 2  concentrations increase by 1% per year, in accordance with the literature on carbon cycle feedbacks ( 41 ). In the second setup, we prescribe more realistic atmospheric CO 2  concentrations, following a historical simulation first and branching into the SSP2-4.5 emission scenario from 2015 until 2100 ( 45 ). The hosing for the SSP2-4.5 setup is only applied after 2015. All the conducted ESM simulations are listed in  SI Appendix , Table S1 . Biogeochemical-only coupling. Our simulations feature freshwater forcing and CO 2  forcing, both of which affect the oceanic carbon cycle; the freshwater forcing by reducing water mass density and weakening the AMOC, and the CO 2  forcing by causing global warming which again causes changes in, among others, solubility, carbonate chemistry, density, mixed layer depth, and biological activity. For this study, we are exclusively interested in carbon cycle changes caused by AMOC-related reductions in physical water mass transport into the deep ocean. All warming-induced carbon cycle changes are potential confounders for this analysis, which we address by running biogeochemically-only coupled (BGC-only) simulations. BGC-only simulations artificially decouple atmospheric CO 2  concentrations from the model’s radiation component so that there is no warming impact from CO 2 . This ensures that the ocean carbon cycle is not affected by CO 2 -induced warming, but only by the AMOC changes we induce through freshwater hosing. At the same time, the carbon cycle as such is undisturbed, and with the 1pct experiment and the SSP2-4.5 scenario, we can study how different amounts of atmospheric CO 2  concentrations influence carbon fluxes into the ocean and how these depend on AMOC strength. AMOC-related carbon-climate feedback. A second method for estimating the influence of AMOC strength on ocean carbon uptake takes the overall oceanic carbon-climate feedback ( 40 ) and disentangles it by ocean basin and by carbon pool in order to determine which parts of the carbon-climate feedback depend on AMOC weakening ( 34 ). Three carbon-climate feedback is differentiated by three carbon pools: saturated carbon, which reflects changes in solubility governed by warming and carbonate chemistry; disequilibrium carbon, which reflects changing amounts of water masses sinking before reaching chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere; and regenerated carbon, which reflects changes in biological processes and residence times of water masses in the ocean interior. Katavouta and Williams ( 34 ) find that the carbon-climate feedbacks of the Atlantic disequilibrium carbon pool ( γ Atl, dis ) and the carbon-climate feedbacks of the Atlantic regenerated carbon pool ( γ Atl, reg ) across different CMIP6 models both correlate with the amount of AMOC weakening that the respective model exhibits. We harness this correlation to construct an AMOC-related carbon-climate feedback  γ AMOC [1] γ AMOC = γ Atl, dis + γ Atl, reg . Regressing this on AMOC strength at the end of the carbon cycle feedback experiments yields the following equation ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 ): γ AMOC = − 0.58 PgC SvK ( Δ A M O C − 3.84 Sv ) . To calculate end-of-simulation ocean carbon storage reductions, we need to choose a value for AMOC weakening  Δ A M O C  and multiply  γ AMOC  with global mean surface temperature at the end of the simulation, as carbon-climate feedback values are normalized with respect to temperature change. From ref.  40 , we get  T 1pct ( 140 ) = 4.87 K , which simplifies the AMOC-related ocean carbon storage reduction  Δ C AMOC  to [2] Δ C AMOC ( Δ A M O C ) = − γ AMOC ( Δ A M O C ) · T 1pct ( 140 ) [3] = 2.825 PgC Sv ( Δ A M O C − 3.84 Sv ) . Analyzing AMOC strength and ocean carbon storage. We define AMOC strength as the maximum meridional flow of water at 26.5 ° N in the Atlantic Ocean for all depths  z  and integrated from west to east: [4] A M O C ( t ) = max z { ∫ W A t l E A t l ∫ 0 z v ( l a t = 26.5 °   N , l o n , z )     d z     d l o n } , where  v ( l a t , l o n , z )  is the meridional northward velocity of water at a specific point in the ocean. We define global ocean carbon storage as the volumetric integral of dissolved inorganic carbon ( DIC ) concentrations: [5] C ocean ( t ) = c ∫ V D I C ( t ) d V , with  c = 12.01 g mol . For both of these quantities, we extract annual values for all MPI-ESM simulations, which form the basis of further calculations. The annual dataset of AMOC strength and carbon storage is available as part of our open-access code repository. AMOC-induced carbon flux changes. We define yearly global carbon fluxes  F ( t )  as the year-on-year change in  C ocean ( t ) . In order to investigate the impact of different AMOC strengths on carbon fluxes into the ocean, we consider the difference between yearly carbon fluxes in hosing simulations and yearly carbon fluxes in the respective simulation without hosing; we call this quantity the AMOC-induced carbon flux change  Δ F AMOC ( t ) [6] Δ F AMOC ( t ) = F hosing ( t ) − F no hosing ( t ) . To relate the carbon flux change  Δ F AMOC ( t )  to the amount of AMOC weakening, we plot it as a function of  A M O C ( t ) , as in  Fig. 3 . For both  Δ F AMOC  and  AMOC , we apply a 10-y running mean in order to capture the overall dynamics rather than short-term fluctuations in carbon storage and AMOC strength. The same results for different running mean windows are shown in the  SI Appendix , Fig. S1 . We then perform two linear regressions, which we call  Δ F 0  and  Δ F 1 :  [7a] Δ F 0 = 0 + c 0 · ( A M O C − A M O C 0 ) [7b] Δ F 1 = c 1 + c 2 · ( A M O C − A M O C 0 ) ,  where  A M O C 0  is the average AMOC strength of the simulations without hosing. The difference between the two regressions is that  Δ F 0  has no 0th-order term so that the AMOC-induced carbon flux change vanishes by definition if the AMOC strength is unchanged. For internal consistency, this is a desirable property. Given that the linear regression coefficients  c 0 = 0.023 PgC yr Sv = 0.025 PgC yr Sv  and  c 2 = 0.022 PgC yr Sv = 0.026 PgC yr Sv  for the SSP2-4.5 scenario (the 1pct experiment) are very similar ( SI Appendix , Table S2 ), we use  Δ F 0  for further calculations. Impacts of the AMOC Carbon Feedback. Integration into META IAM. We use the most recent version of the META IAM ( 5 ) for assessing the 21st-century impacts of the AMOC carbon feedback on carbon storage, temperature, climate damages, and the SCC. The META model has a base configuration that comprises socioeconomic and emission scenarios, the FaIR 2.0.0 simple climate model ( 48 ), pattern-scaling, a country-level damage function, and a discounted utility component. On top of that, META has several modules for tipping dynamics and climate feedbacks, among them the AMOC-induced cooling effect. We build an AMOC carbon module that differs from the existing AMOC cooling module in that it does not follow stochastically triggered tipping dynamics, but instead comes with an explicit representation of yearly AMOC strength, which again depends on global temperatures. We introduce the variable  Δ A M O C , which describes AMOC weakening and depends on the change in atmospheric temperatures since the beginning of the scenario modeling period in 2015: [8] Δ A M O C ( t ) = β AMOC ( t ) T atm ( t ) − T atm ( 2015 ) . The parameter  β AMOC  describes the sensitivity of the AMOC to global warming. For stylized scenario analyses, this parameter can be taken to be constant, but it can also be calibrated such as to follow annual projections of AMOC strength. Note that  Δ A M O C  is positive when the AMOC weakens. Absolute AMOC strength  AMOC  is obtained by [9] A M O C ( t ) = A M O C ( 2015 ) − Δ A M O C ( t ) + ϵ AMOC ( t ) , where  ϵ AMOC  is a random fluctuation in AMOC strength that can be calibrated to AMOC projection uncertainty. The AMOC-induced reduction in carbon uptake is formally equivalent to additional emissions, which we model through the AMOC-induced carbon flux change  Δ F AMOC [10] Δ F AMOC ( t ) = ( c 0 + ϵ c 0 ) · ( A M O C pi + ϵ A M O C pi − A M O C ( t ) ) · A M O C pi,MPI A M O C pi . Here,  c 0  relates AMOC strength to carbon flux changes (Eq.  7a ,  SI Appendix , Table S2 ), and  ϵ c 0  represents the uncertainty about  c 0 .  A M O C pi  is the preindustrial AMOC strength of a given model that the AMOC carbon module is calibrated to, and  ϵ A M O C pi  the associated uncertainty. The second term in Eq.  10  describes AMOC weakening in year  t , and the third term converts the weakening into equivalent weakening in MPI-ESM. We model the carbon flux change as dependent on the AMOC weakening with respect to preindustrial values, not 2015 values, because in our MPI-ESM simulations, we compare hosing-induced changes to no-hosing simulations that do not exhibit any warming; the appropriate reference is thus the preindustrial AMOC strength. Since our estimates of  c 0  are obtained with MPI-ESM and absolute AMOC weakening differs widely between ESMs, we convert model-specific weakening into equivalent weakening in MPI-ESM through the ratio of respective preindustrial AMOC strengths. The additional CO 2  flux  Δ F AMOC  is then passed on to the emissions module of META, from where it influences global temperatures and climate damages. Calibration to CMIP6 AMOC projections. The AMOC carbon module of META can be calibrated to stylized scenarios of AMOC weakening, but also to ESM projections. We collected those historical and SSP2-4.5 simulations by ESMs participating in CMIP6 that are available from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and include the variable msftmz for calculating AMOC strength. Of these, we use only the ones that have at least three ensemble members. For MPI-ESM1.2-LR and NorESM2-LM, we additionally collected SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 AMOC projections; here, we have only one ensemble member of NorESM2-LM and hence no ensemble SD. We also collected preindustrial control simulations of all the models for which we have AMOC projections. From these preindustrial control simulations, we get the mean and SD of preindustrial AMOC strength. For calibrating the AMOC carbon component, we first extract the time series for global mean surface temperature from META along the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Then we choose  β AMOC ( t )  such that for every year, the deterministic SSP2-4.5 temperature scenario leads to AMOC weakening that exactly corresponds to a given ESM projection of AMOC strength. This implies that for warming scenarios above (below) the deterministic SSP2-4.5 in META, the AMOC will weaken more (less) than projected by a given ESM. Uncertainty treatment. For all projections and SCC calculations, we run 10,000 Monte Carlo samples. For this, we sample parameters for the simple climate model FaIR from the constrained parameter ensemble in ref.  48 , following the implementation in ref.  61 . To calibrate the uncertainty about the preindustrial AMOC strength of a given ESM, we use the SD of the distribution of AMOC strength in the model’s historical experiment. For every Monte Carlo sample, we draw from a normal distribution with this SD and use this draw as the value for  ϵ A M O C pi . To calibrate the uncertainty about AMOC projections, we average the ensemble SD over time and then, for every year, draw from a normal distribution with this SD. This gives a time series of  ϵ AMOC ( t ) , which is able to emulate the year-on-year fluctuations that we observe in both projections and observations of AMOC strength. To calibrate the uncertainty about the carbon flux change resulting from a certain AMOC strength value, we take the SE of the regression coefficient  c 0  in Eq.  7a  and for every Monte Carlo sample, we draw an  ϵ c 0  value from a normal distribution. Economic damage estimation. To calculate additional climate damages caused by the AMOC carbon feedback, we extract the path of total climate damages from each Monte Carlo simulation of the META model and then take the difference between total damages in a model configuration with the AMOC carbon feedback and a model configuration without the AMOC carbon feedback. This time series of additional damages is aggregated and discounted to 2015 net present values, which is when the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and hence the AMOC weakening, starts. We use a social discount rate based on the deterministic Ramsey rule, with elasticity of marginal utility of consumption  η = 1.05  and rate of pure time preference  δ = 0.5 %  as in META, and the global growth rate as projected by the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Because the META model variables for consumption and damages are given in 2010 US dollar values, we adjust them to 2024 US dollar values by multiplying with 1.44 based on inflation rates. For all economic calculations, we retain the parameter values of the most recent version of META ( Github ,  5 ); the values are also given in the text box of  Fig. 5 . The damage persistence parameter  φ  describes the amount of climate damage that is still felt in the year after the damage is caused. A  φ  value of 1 means there is no persistence; a  φ  value of 1 means there is full persistence. The value  φ = 0.25 , as used in the META model, is calibrated based on ref.  62 . The results of a sensitivity analysis on  η ,  δ ,  φ , and the damage function coefficient are shown in the  SI Appendix , Table S4 . Assessing SCC changes. The SCC effect of the AMOC carbon feedback is estimated in the base META model, without any further feedbacks or tipping dynamics activated. Since META does not optimize, this SCC estimate is contingent on the underlying socioeconomic scenario, in our case SSP2-4.5 (and for two AMOC projections also SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6). We always report values for the SCC in 2020. We determine the relative SCC impact of including the AMOC carbon feedback through [11] Δ S C C = S C C AMOC − S C C no AMOC S C C no AMOC . We always compare the base META model (“no AMOC"") and the META model with the activated AMOC carbon feedback (“AMOC"") for the same Monte Carlo sample so that the difference between these two values stems only from the inclusion of the AMOC carbon feedback, not from uncertain parameters that differ between runs. This results in 10,000 estimates of the relative SCC effect  Δ S C C  of the AMOC carbon feedback, which are depicted in  Fig. 5 ."

66,intro,"1. Introduction Pott’s Puffy Tumor (PPT) is defined as one or more subperiosteal abscesses of the frontal bone associated with underlying osteitis and osteomyelitis [ 1 ]. It was first described by Sir Percivall Pott, who related it to earlier forehead trauma in 1768 and to earlier frontal sinusitis in 1775 [ 2 ]. It appears as localized swelling of the forehead, with inflammatory signs, tenderness, and swelling of the overlying skin. Associated typical symptoms are headache, periorbital swelling, rhinorrhea, fever, vomiting, and lethargy [ 1 ]. PPT is often an indicator of intracranial complications [ 1 ]. The infection has the potential to extend into the intracranial cavity through bony erosions, pre-existing pathways, or septic thrombosis via the Haversian canals. This propagation can lead to severe intracranial complications such as meningitis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, intracerebral abscess, and dural sinus thrombophlebitis [ 1 ]. In such cases, computed tomography (CT) is employed for treatment planning, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection of intracranial complications [ 2 ]. PPT was once considered a rare occurrence in the post-antibiotics era, with the majority of reported cases involving adolescents and young adults. This increased susceptibility in the younger age group can be attributed to two main factors: the heightened vascularity of their diploic system and the relative increase in blood supply to the still-developing frontal sinuses [ 3 ]. Despite advancements in early detection, targeted antibiotic treatments, and surgical interventions, the morbidity and mortality associated with intracranial complications of sinusitis have significantly decreased. However, intracranial complications still manifest, necessitating swift diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment to prevent long-term neurological sequelae and fatalities [ 4 ]. This study aims to present an up-to-date systematic review of the etiological, clinical, surgical, as well as microbiological findings related to PPT in young patients. Additionally, it aims to foster discussion on the treatment course, which remains a topic of controversy in the literature."

Case Report A 12-year-old, Italian male with no comorbidities complained of nasal congestion and headache for one month, who was initially treated by his general practitioner with oral amoxicillin (1 g every 12 h for a week). He presented thereafter to the emergency department clinic with progressively increasing frontal swelling and eyelid edema. He underwent cerebral and head and neck contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI that revealed a complicated frontal sinusitis with bone erosion of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus and an epidural collection with peripheral rim enhancement at the frontal lobe, suggestive of an epidural abscess with compression of sagittal sinus ( Figure 1 ). He was transferred to our hospital where he received intravenous (IV) vancomycin 40 mg/kg/day, metronidazole 20 mg/kg/day, and ceftazidime 2 g/day. Ophthalmological evaluation excluded orbital complications.  The patient underwent Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) with a right total ethmoidectomy, right frontal sinusotomy (Draf IIa) ( Figure 2 A), and maxillary antrostomy. Concomitant craniotomy with trephination and drainage of the brain abscess was performed for the epidural empyema and subperiosteal abscess ( Figure 2 B). The craniotomy operculum was rebuilt with a custom titanium plate because of the osteomyelitis which involved the frontal bone. Microbiological analysis of the purulent material demonstrated growth of  Streptococcus intermedius . The patient remained hospitalized in our department for 6 weeks, and he received IV antibiotics throughout the entire hospital stay. The follow-up MRI performed 6 weeks after surgery revealed the resolution of the subperiosteal and epidural abscesses. He was discharged with saline irrigative 3 times/day with no clinical symptoms and no radiological signs. He continued oral antibiotics for another 4 weeks. Informed consent was obtained for publication purposes. 3.2. Search Results and Quality Assessment After duplicates removal and exclusion of 221 records due to coherence with the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 135 articles relevant to the topic were examined. No records were unavailable for retrieving. Finally, 109 were included in the review [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 , 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ]. A detailed flowchart of the search process is shown in  Figure 3 . In accordance with the National Institute of Health’s quality assessment tool for Observational Cohorts and Cross-Sectional Studies [ 6 ], 20 studies (18.3%) were deemed of Good quality, 69 (63.4%) Fair, and 20 studies (18.3%) as Poor, due to the lack of reporting clinical data ( Table S1 ). 3.3. Included Studies’ Characteristics Among the 110 studies included in the qualitative analysis, 99 were case papers [ 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 104 , 105 , 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ], while only 11 studies were case series [ 3 , 15 , 19 , 40 , 55 , 57 , 76 , 78 , 91 , 102 , 106 ]. These studies were published between 1949 and 2023 (see  Table 1 ). 3.4. Included Patients’ Characteristics The total number of patients was 184, where 124 (67.4%) were male and 54 female (29.3%). The mean age of the patients was 12.06 ± 3.29 years (range 1.92–18 years) (refer to  Table 2 ).  The most common etiology was acute rhinosinusitis (69.35%) described in terms of pansinusitis, while frontal acute rhinosinusitis was counted in 22 patients (11.89%). Chronic rhinosinusitis as etiology was clearly stated for six patients (3.26%). Head trauma was found to be the most common cause excluding sinusitis (12; 6.52%). Other etiologies are reported in  Table 2 .  3.5. Imaging Assessment In the current analysis, the majority of authors relied on ce-CT as the primary imaging modality for diagnosing PTT and its complications, accounting for 86 cases (46.73%). Additionally, a combination of ce-CT and ce-MRI was utilized in 17.93% of cases (refer to  Table 1 ). 3.6. Pathogens Microbiological analysis frequently resulted in multiple growth, with streptococci being the most prevalent individual pathogens (85, 40.66%). Among streptococci,  Streptococcus intermedius  was the most frequently cultured (11.96%), while staphylococci accounted for 9.38% of cases. Sterile cultures were prevalent (14.35%) (refer to  Table 3 ). As illustrated in  Figure 4 , there has been no substantial variation in pathogens over time, with the most frequent being those from the Streptococcus species. 3.7. Medical Treatment All patients received antibiotic therapy, with the duration of treatment ranging from 10 days to 6 months, averaging 6.8 weeks. The predominant antibiotics utilized were ceftriaxone (20.73%) and metronidazole (20.73%), either individually or in combination (see  Table 4 ). 3.8. Intracranial Extension Based on our examination, 131 (71.19%) out of the patients considered in this analysis experienced intracranial complications. Among them, 38 patients were ≤10 years of age (29.00%), 81 patients (61.83%) were between 11 and 18 years old, and 6 patients (4.58%) did not have their age reported. The predominant intracranial complication observed was epidural abscess (42.59%), succeeded by subdural empyema (17.12%), thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (6.48%), and brain abscess (5.55%). Multiple intracranial complications were identified in 38 patients (29.00%). Age, sex, type of imaging assessment, pathogen type, and culture species were not statistically correlated with the development of intracranial complications ( p  value > 0.05). Intracranial complications were significantly associated with the type of surgical treatment ( p  value < 0.0001). Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons showed the preference for a combined surgical approach in patients with intracranial complications than in those without intracranial involvement, compared to external ( p  = 0.022) and endoscopic interventions ( p  = 0.0002). The details of the intracranial complications from the studies included are provided in  Table 5 . No other relevant associations were found between intracranial complications and the clinical variables considered ( Table 6 ). 3.9. Surgical Treatment Only seven patients (3.80%) did not undergo any surgery, and out of these, four (2.17%) had intracranial involvement. The type of surgery was not available for 10 cases (5.43%). In all other instances, surgery using various approaches was carried out. The majority of the authors opted for an external surgical approach for draining subperiosteal abscesses (11.41%). Some authors employed endoscopic endonasal treatment either independently (15.21%) or in conjunction with external drainage (9.78%). Regarding intracranial complications, craniotomy was the primary surgical method in most articles, either on its own (9.23%) or in combination with external drainage (11.41%), endonasal surgery (15.21%), or as a combination of all three modalities (10.32%). Additional combinations of surgeries are detailed in  Table 7 ."
68,discussion,"4. Discussion 4.1. Epidemiology The determination of frequency measures for PPT is challenging due to its rare occurrence. Although it is experiencing minor annual variations, there seems to be an upward trend in the reported cases of PPT in recent years, as illustrated in  Figure 5 . While these fluctuations may be influenced by publishing pattern, they underscore the significance of promptly recognizing factors that could contribute to PPT predisposition. Frontal sinuses become pneumatized at 6 years of age, and they reach their adult configuration at the age of 15 [ 28 ]; that is why teenagers are especially affected by this entity. To our knowledge, only two cases have been reported in children younger than 3 years of age in the literature in the post-antibiotic era [ 22 , 50 ]. 4.2. Pathophysiology PPT typically manifests following sinusitis, particularly in cases of pansinusitis. Originating from the frontal sinus, the infection progresses through the frontal bone marrow cavity, inducing osteomyelitis that erodes the external table, leading to the formation of a subperiosteal abscess. Additionally, the infection may extend to the posterior table, giving rise to an epidural abscess. Despite the relative impermeability of the dura mater and arachnoid membranes, the infection can breach these barriers, spreading to the subdural space and causing subdural collections or cerebritis [ 28 ]. Consideration should also be given to the hematogenous route, as valveless diploic veins can become infected, resulting in septic thrombophlebitis of the sagittal sinus, subdural empyema, and brain abscess [ 113 ]. This phenomenon is more common in children than adults [ 113 ]. Persistent bacterial overgrowth in the frontal sinus cavity and adjacent soft tissues allows for small vessel thrombosis and venous congestion [ 48 ]. The disruption of the frontal periosteal blood supply initiates an inflammatory response characterized by increased intraosseous pressure, leading to extensive necrosis of the trabecular bone matrix. The resulting avascular and ischemic conditions favor the transition from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, promoting the growth of opportunistic microorganisms that give rise to abscesses and cortical sinus tracts. In certain instances, the infection can involve the floor of the frontal sinus, extending to the orbits and causing either orbital cellulitis or an orbital abscess [ 113 ]. These theories may partly explain the difference in the incidence of intracranial complications between adult and juvenile populations. In fact, a recent systematic review on intra-orbital complications of Pott’s Puffy Tumor in adults reported an incidence of around 30%, compared to approximately 70% in our review of younger patients [ 114 ]. In our study, the proportion of cases in individuals under 18 years of age was 59.5% (184/309), while cases in adults accounted for 40.5% (125/309) [ 114 ]. 4.3. Clinical Presentation  A gradually tendered tumefaction of the scalp at the forehead is a distinctive indicator of PPT. The initial symptoms and signs of PPT often present subtly, resembling frontal sinusitis. The onset of pronounced symptoms, especially heightened headache and fever, or the manifestation of signs indicating increased intracranial pressure (such as nausea, vomiting, lethargy), periorbital complaints, or a lack of symptom resolution despite antibiotic treatment, necessitate imaging evaluation to detect potential silent intracranial involvement, even in the absence of overt neurological symptoms [ 113 ]. 4.4. Imaging Modalities Early diagnosis of PPT is crucial for minimizing morbidity and mortality, necessitating a heightened level of suspicion. Diagnosis primarily relies on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s history, clinical examination, and imaging studies. When a subperiosteal abscess is suspected, appropriate imaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis and assess potential complications. The diagnostic workup should involve a ce-CT scan with brain and bony sequences, as it excels in visualizing bone structures and effectively delineates air–bone and air–soft tissue interfaces crucial for sinus surgeons [ 109 ]. CT scans can reveal sinusitis, bone erosion, subperiosteal collections, and intracranial extensions, with osteomyelitis indicated by low-attenuated areas of lytic bone destruction. CT is both quick and widely accessible, with pediatric protocols recommended to minimize radiation exposure in children [ 4 ]. MRI offers superior soft tissue resolution, making it the gold standard for detecting intracranial complications, dural sinus thrombosis, and bone edema [ 52 ]. However, its drawbacks include increased time consumption, the need for anesthesia in younger children, limitations in evaluation bony destruction, and limited availability, even though it can be used to reduce radiation exposure. MRI venography should be added when clinical suspicion of dural or cavernous sinus thrombosis arises [ 19 ]. While ultrasound has been proposed for PPT detection in children [ 85 ], its diagnostic value remains inadequately investigated in the literature. Additionally, bone Tc-mMP scintigraphy may offer heightened sensitivity compared to CT in early-stage osteomyelitis, though it proves less sensitive in an acute sinusitis setting [ 115 ]. Based on the current review, CT emerges as the most effective and commonly used imaging modality for PPT diagnosis. However, in cases with suspected intracranial involvement, MRI is recommended. 4.5. Intracranial Manifestations  The risk of intracranial complications associated with PPT is noteworthy, with reported incidences ranging from 43% to 85% in various studies [ 1 , 52 , 113 , 116 ]. The anterior pericranium is particularly susceptible to infection spread due to its rich venous plexus, directly communicating with the diploic veins of the frontal sinus cavity. This anatomical feature enables retrograde flow of septic emboli into the cranial vault, seeding the intracranial space, with or without concurrent erosion of the posterior table of the frontal sinus. PPT can lead to brain abscess, epidural and subdural abscess, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, pneumocephalus, and meningitis. Less commonly, it can lead to cerebritis and fistula formation [ 52 ]. While the frequency of each type of collection varies in published reports, epidural collections are suggested to be the most common focal intracranial manifestation of PPT [ 1 , 52 , 113 , 116 ]. Our review found that 92 patients had epidural abscesses, accounting for over 40% of the total cases and more than half of the patients with intracranial complications. Intracranial complications are often associated with leukocytosis, elevated ESR, and raised CRP levels [ 34 ], indicative of the bacterial origin of the complication. Given the high incidence of seizures in intracranial abscesses (ranging from 19% to 80% of affected patients), immediate initiation of anticonvulsant therapy as prophylaxis against seizures is recommended for all patients with intracranial complications of sinusitis [ 40 , 117 ]. Extracranial complications, such as orbital infections, often co-occur with intracranial disease and shape the clinical presentation, particularly in pediatric patients lacking neurological symptoms. Visible craniofacial manifestations of PPT may serve as early indicators for patients, prompting them to seek medical evaluation sooner. 4.6. Microbiology Due to the comparatively lower oxygen concentration in the frontal sinus, microaerophilic streptococci, including alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus,  Peptostreptococcus ,  Bacteroides  spp., and various anaerobes (such as  Prevotella ,  Porphyromonas ,  Fusobacterium , and  Peptostreptococcus  spp.), were predominantly cultured from sinogenic sources. Additionally, less-frequently encountered organisms included  Hemophilus influenza ,  Staphylococcus aureus , and  Enterococcus  spp. [ 2 , 15 , 118 ]. In our review, the most prevalent bacteria were identified as Streptococcus species, notably  Streptococcus intermedius , accounting for 11.96% of cases. The prompt initiation of empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment during the initial surgery likely played a significant role in the absence of identifiable pathogens in the subsequent cultures.  4.7. Treatment The initial treatment of a patient with a PPT is high-dose intravenous antibiotics. The selected antibiotics should possess the capability to cross the blood–brain barrier and provide coverage against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria [ 3 ]. A commonly chosen combination includes a third-generation cephalosporin, metronidazole, and penicillin or vancomycin [see  Table 1 ]. The antibiotic course is typically extended for a minimum of 6–8 weeks postoperatively [ 2 , 118 ]. The successful management of PPT involves a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention. Adequate treatment has significantly reduced the mortality rate of sinogenic intracranial complications from 60% to 3.7% [ 118 ].  Historically, the osteoplastic flap was a conventional surgical access method to the anterior frontal sinus table in PPT. However, with the introduction of endoscopes and powered instrumentation, these methods have been largely replaced by ESS [ 106 ]. ESS is superior to classic techniques, providing effective management of the ostio–meatal complex and in opening the frontal recess, which cannot be externally approached [ 119 ]. While ESS is often highly effective, select cases with significant pericranial extension may necessitate an external approach with osteoplasties. The neurosurgical approach to focal intracranial suppuration, particularly subdural empyema, is a subject of debate. Craniotomy is favored in former series examining subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis [ 117 , 120 ]. Small intracranial involvement without focal neurological deficits may initially be managed conservatively but may require craniotomies for abscesses refractory to medical management. Joint neurosurgical drainage and endoscopic or external sinus drainage have been shown to be more effective, leading to faster recovery and shorter hospital length of stay [ 121 ]. Frontal lobe abscesses can be treated based on the patient’s condition and the maturity of the abscess wall, either through aspiration with radiological localization or total excision via craniotomy. In our study, we observed that in the presence of intracranial complications, there is a higher prevalence of using a combined approach. This suggests that employing multiple techniques may be more effective for draining intracranial abscesses, whether epidural, subdural, or cerebral. Regardless of the principal treatment, the primary goal remains to drain the abscess and re-establish adequate frontoethmoidal drainage through surgical opening of the sinuses and prolonged antibiotic treatment. Successful treatment of PPT necessitates close collaboration between otorhinolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, pediatricians, bacteriologists, and other related departments. 4.8. Limitations of the Study The present study has several limitations that are worthy of mention: - Case reports: the review primarily included case reports and short case series, which can limit the generalizability of findings due to variability and heterogeneity. - Missing data: some older articles lacked details relevant to the study, leading to the exclusion of some information from the analyses. - Evolution of treatment: the evolution of surgical technique and overall management of PPT that has taken place over the last decades may have improved outcomes, potentially affecting the comparability of older data with more recent data."
69,conclusions,"5. Conclusions The rarity of PPT poses challenges in defining its frequency accurately, with reported cases displaying an upward trend in recent years. Early diagnosis is imperative for mitigating morbidity and mortality, requiring a heightened level of suspicion. Imaging, particularly contrast-enhanced CT scans, plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis and evaluating potential complications. The risk of intracranial complications in PPT is significant, emphasizing the necessity for a combined approach involving high-dose intravenous antibiotics and surgery. This strategy is crucial in preventing long-term neurological complications and sequelae. Collaborative efforts among multidisciplinary teams, including otorhinolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, pediatricians, and bacteriologists, are indispensable for effective patient management."
70,introduction,"INTRODUCTION The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) effectively transports heat and salt through the global ocean ( 1 ) and strongly modulates regional and global climate. Continuous section measurements of the AMOC, available since 2004 at 26°N from the RAPID-MOCHA array ( 2 ), have shown that the AMOC strength has decreased by a few Sverdrups (1 Sv = 10 6  m 3  s −1 ) from 2004 to 2012, and thereafter, it has strengthened ( 3 ) again. Longer timescale variability of the AMOC strength, estimated by using sea surface temperature (SST) time series based on “fingerprint” patterns ( 4 ), indicates that the AMOC weakened by 3 ± 1 Sv since about 1950. From proxy records, it has been suggested that the AMOC is currently in its weakest state in over a millennium ( 5 ). The AMOC has been labeled as one of the tipping elements in the climate system ( 6 ,  7 ), indicating that it may undergo a relatively rapid change under a slowly developing forcing. The AMOC is particularly sensitive to the ocean’s freshwater forcing, either through the surface freshwater flux (e.g., precipitation) or by input of fresh water due to river runoff or ice melt (e.g., from the Greenland Ice Sheet). Although no AMOC tipping has been found in historical observations, there is much evidence from proxy records that abrupt AMOC changes have occurred in the geological past during the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events ( 8 – 10 ). Classical early warning indicators, such as the increase in the variance and/or the (lag-1) autocorrelation, when applied to SST-based time series, suggest that the present-day AMOC approaches a tipping point before the end of this century ( 11 ,  12 ). Apart from the fact that the SST-based AMOC fingerprints may not represent the AMOC behavior adequately, many (statistical) assumptions are required to estimate the approaching AMOC tipping point ( 12 – 15 ). Hence, there is strong need for a more physics-based, observable, and reliable early warning indicator that characterizes the AMOC tipping point."
71,results,"RESULTS AMOC collapse To develop such an early warning indicator, we performed a targeted simulation to find an AMOC tipping event in the Community Earth System Model (CESM; version 1.0.5). This CESM version, which has been used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), phase 5, has horizontal resolutions of 1° for the ocean/sea ice and 2° for the atmosphere/land components (see Materials and Methods). We start from a statistical equilibrium solution of a preindustrial control simulation ( 16 ) and keep greenhouse gas and solar and aerosol forcings constant to preindustrial levels during the simulation. A quasi-equilibrium approach ( 17 – 19 ) is followed by adding a slowly varying freshwater flux anomaly  F H  in the North Atlantic over the region between latitudes 20°N and 50°N. This freshwater flux anomaly is compensated over the rest of the domain, as shown in the inset of  Fig. 1A . We linearly increased the freshwater flux forcing with a rate of 3 × 10 −4  Sv year −1  until model year 2200, where a maximum of  F H  = 0.66 Sv is reached. Such a simulation has not been conducted before with a complex global climate model (GCM) (i.e., used in CMIP5 and beyond) as the CESM version used here because of the high computational costs and it cannot easily be repeated for a suite of different GCMs. Fig. 1. AMOC collapse. ( A ) The AMOC strength at 1000 m and 26°N, where the yellow shading indicates observed ranges ( 60 ,  61 ). The cyan-colored lines indicate the magnitude of  F H . The red arrow indicates the AMOC tipping point (model year 1758; fig. S1, A and B), and the blue sections indicate the 50-year periods used in (B) to (D). Inset: The hosing experiment where fresh water is added to the ocean surface between 20°N and 50°N in the Atlantic Ocean (+ F H ) and is compensated over the remaining ocean surface (− F H ). The black sections indicate the 26°N and 34°S latitudes over which the AMOC strength and freshwater transport ( F ovS ) are determined, respectively. ( B  to  D ) AMOC streamfunction (Ψ) and Atlantic meridional heat transport (MHT; see also fig. S2) for model years 1 to 50, 1701 to 1750, and 2151 to 2200. The contours indicate the isolines of Ψ for different values. Under increasing freshwater forcing, we find a gradual decrease ( Fig. 1A ) in the AMOC strength (see Materials and Methods). Natural variability dominates the AMOC strength in the first 400 years; however, after model year 800, a clear negative trend appears because of the increasing freshwater forcing. Then, after 1750 years of model integration, we find an abrupt AMOC collapse (fig. S1, A and B). The AMOC strength is about 10 Sv in model year 1750 and decreases to 2 Sv 100 years later (model year 1850) and eventually becomes slightly negative after model year 2000. Such a transient AMOC response (model years 1750 to 1850) is spectacular considering the slow change in the freshwater forcing (i.e., ∆ F H  = 0.03 Sv). The characteristic meridional overturning circulation and associated northward heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean have decreased to nearly zero and by 75% (at 26°N), respectively, after model year 2000 ( Fig. 1, B to D , and fig. S2A). This result differs substantially from earlier model simulations with GCMs that have used extremely large freshwater forcing [e.g., 1 Sv per year over 50°N to 70°N ( 20 )] or large initial salinity perturbations ( 21 ). The AMOC collapse in these simulations is a direct response to the very strong forcing, whereas in our model simulations, which are more akin to the simulations in Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity ( 17 ,  18 ), the collapse is primarily a response due to internal feedbacks. This can be quantified by looking at the AMOC change per cumulative change in North Atlantic freshwater forcing, which is about  R = 8   Sv 1.5   Sv   year = 5.3   year − 1  in our hosing simulations (model years 1750 to 1850) and about  R = 18   Sv 50   Sv   year = 0.36   year − 1  for the strong forcing of 1 Sv/year over a 50-year period for the results in ( 20 ). For  R  ≪ 1 year −1 , the AMOC changes are primarily driven by the freshwater forcing, and for  R  ≫ 1 year −1 , the AMOC changes are mainly induced by internal feedbacks. Also, on the basis of the change in the AMOC per forcing change (here about 8-Sv AMOC change due to a forcing change of 0.03 Sv), it is clear that we found an AMOC tipping event ( 6 ) in the CESM simulation, which is the first one found in a complex GCM. The FAMOUS model ( 18 ), forced under a slowly varying freshwater forcing of 5 × 10 −4  Sv year −1 , shows AMOC tipping, and there, the AMOC change per cumulative freshwater forcing is  R = 17   Sv 17   Sv   year = 1   year − 1  . This value of  R  indicates that both freshwater forcing and internal feedbacks are both important in inducing AMOC changes. This is a factor 5 smaller with respect to the CESM, which is likely related to the coarser horizontal ocean resolution (2.5° × 3.75°) and associated higher viscosity in FAMOUS. The differences in important ocean observables between the two different AMOC states (averages over model years 2151 to 2200 minus years 1 to 50) are presented in fig. S3. Figure S3A shows a cooling of the Northern Hemispheric SSTs when the AMOC collapses, with SST differences as large as 10°C near western Europe. On the contrary, the SSTs in the Southern Hemisphere increase because of the collapse resulting in a distinct seesaw pattern between the hemispheres ( 22 ). This pattern arises from the reduced meridional heat exchange between the hemispheres (fig. S2). The North Atlantic upper 100-m salinities are also strongly influenced under the AMOC collapse (fig. S3B). Note that salinities outside of the Atlantic have increased partly because of the freshwater flux compensation used in the setup of the quasi-equilibrium experiment. From the changes in the annual maximum mixed-layer depth (fig. S3C), it can be deduced that deep convection ceases in the North Atlantic (around Greenland), which is in accordance with the reversed AMOC state ( Fig. 1D ). Other regions, such as the Southern Ocean, show an increase in the mixed-layer depth. The weakening of the AMOC results, via geostrophic balance, in dynamic sea-level rise in the Atlantic Ocean (fig. S3D) and some coastal regions experiences more than 70 cm of dynamic sea-level rise. Climate impacts The SST changes due to AMOC collapse also affect the atmosphere and global sea-ice distribution. The atmospheric responses (fig. S4) consist of a seesaw pattern in the 2-m surface temperature, a southward intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) shift, and the strengthening of the Hadley Cell in the Northern Hemisphere. The stronger meridional temperature gradient over the Northern Hemisphere amplifies the subtropical jet, while the opposite happens in the Southern Hemisphere. During the gradual AMOC weakening over the first 1400 model years, there were no significant trends [ P  > 0.05, two-sided  t  test ( 23 )] in the global mean surface temperature or in the global sea-ice area. Under the AMOC collapse, the Arctic (March) sea-ice pack extends down to 50°N and there is a gradual retreat of the Antarctic (September) sea-ice pack (fig. S5). The vast expansion of the Northern Hemispheric sea-ice pack amplifies further Northern Hemispheric cooling via the ice-albedo feedback. These findings are qualitatively similar to those in ( 20 ), in which AMOC is strongly weakened to 3 to 4 Sv. The aforementioned ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice responses strongly influence the regional climates across the globe ( Fig. 2 ). The European climate is significantly different after the AMOC collapse, whereas for other regions only specific months undergo significant changes. The Amazon rainforest also shows a drastic change in their precipitation patterns due to ITCZ shifts, and the dry season becomes the wet season and vice versa. These AMOC-induced precipitation changes could severely disrupt the ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest ( 7 ,  24 ,  25 ) and potentially lead to cascading tipping ( 26 – 28 ). The Northern Hemisphere shows cooler temperatures after the AMOC collapse, while the opposite is true for the Southern Hemisphere, although not all changes are significantly different (due to large interannual variability). Fig. 2. Climograph for different regions. The climograph for six different regions (spatial average over the 10° × 10° boxes), where the bars indicate the monthly precipitation and the curves indicate the monthly temperatures. The climograph is determined over model years 1 to 50 (red bars and curves) and model years 2151 to 2200 (blue bars and curves). Note the different vertical ranges for each climograph. The letters P and T in the bars indicate significant ( P  < 0.05, two-sided Welch’s  t  test) monthly differences for precipitation and temperature, respectively. The European climate is greatly affected ( Fig. 3A ) under the AMOC collapse. Note that the corresponding changes occur within a relatively short period (model years 1750 to 1850) and under a very small change in surface freshwater forcing. The yearly averaged atmospheric surface temperature trend exceeds 1°C per decade over a broad region in northwestern Europe, and for several European cities, temperatures are found to drop by 5° to 15°C ( Fig. 3C ). The trends are even more notable when considering particular months ( Fig. 3B ). As an example, February temperatures for Bergen (Norway) will drop by about 3.5°C per decade ( Fig. 3D ). These relatively strong temperature trends are associated with the sea-ice albedo feedback through the vast expansion of the Arctic sea-ice pack (fig. S5A). Fig. 3.

The trends are determined over model years 1750 to 1850 (yellow shading) during which the AMOC strength strongly decreases. ( D ) Monthly temperature trends for the five different cities. Physics-based early warning indicator From idealized ocean-climate models, it has been suggested that the freshwater transport of the AMOC at 34°S, indicated by  F ovS  (see Materials and Methods), is an important indicator of AMOC stability ( 29 – 33 ). The reason is that this quantity is a measure of the salt-advection feedback strength, thought crucial in AMOC tipping. This feedback describes the amplification of a freshwater perturbation in the North Atlantic through a weakening of the AMOC, which leads to less northward salt transport and, hence, amplification of the initial freshwater perturbation ( 34 ,  35 ). In the CESM results here ( Fig. 4A ),  F ovS  is positive at the beginning of the simulation, which indicates that the AMOC exports net salinity (with respect to reference salinity of 35 g kg −1 ) out of the Atlantic. This is not in agreement with observations ( 36 ,  37 ), which is a well-known bias in CMIP phase 3 ( 38 ), phase 5 ( 21 ), and phase 6 ( 37 ) models. In the CMIP phase 6 (CMIP6) models, this bias is mainly due to large biases (compared to observations) in the freshwater flux over the Indian Ocean ( 37 ). Fig. 4. Freshwater transport by the AMOC and Atlantic Ocean freshwater budget. ( A ) Freshwater transport by the AMOC at 34°S,  F ovS . The cyan-colored lines indicate the magnitude of  F H .

Positive (negative) values indicate the northward transport of net fresh water (salinity). ( D )  F ovS  and AMOC strength over time. The time series are displayed as 25-year averages (to reduce the variability of the time series). The markers indicate the 50-year average over a particular period. The cyan-colored curve indicates the present-day (1994 to 2020) CMIP6 regression and 1 SD ( 37 ). The yellow shading in (A) and (D) indicates observed ranges ( 21 ,  42 ,  60 ,  61 ) for  F ovS  and AMOC strength. The Atlantic Ocean is a net evaporative basin, and as imposed, its surface freshwater flux increases at the same rate as the freshwater forcing before the AMOC collapse ( Fig. 4B ). A larger salinity transport into (and/or larger freshwater transport export out of) the Atlantic Ocean is needed to balance the Atlantic’s freshwater budget ( 29 ), resulting in a declining freshwater convergence ( F ∇ b ;  Fig. 4B ). The freshwater convergence is not fully compensating the surface freshwater transport changes (≈0.1-Sv difference in model year 1700), resulting in freshwater storage in the Atlantic Ocean (  W ¯  ;  Fig. 4B ), in particular, below 1000-m depths. The freshwater convergence changes are primarily driven by  F ovS  changes (82%), followed by (azonal) gyre changes at 60°N (32%) ( Fig. 4C ). Note that the (azonal) gyre changes at 34°S negatively contribute (−15%) to freshwater convergence changes. The results in  Fig. 4  show that  F ovS  plays a dominant role in balancing the Atlantic’s freshwater budget under the imposed freshwater forcing. Before the AMOC collapse, the salinity changes (at 34°S) are larger than the meridional velocity changes (fig. S6) and indicate that  F ovS  changes are primarily induced by salinity changes. Although the individual contributions of salinity and velocity to  F ovS  changes cannot be quantified, both factors contribute to  F ovS . This is well demonstrated after the AMOC collapse (right column in fig. S6), where the velocity response decreases the (negative) magnitude of  F ovS . When the salinities adjust to the collapsed state,  F ovS  becomes positive again, which is in line with the analyses from idealized climate model studies ( 31 ,  32 ). The range of  F ovS  and AMOC changes in the northward overturning regime (until model year 1750) is within ( Fig. 4D ) that of present-day simulations of CMIP6 models ( 37 ). However, the most important result here is that  F ovS  goes through a minimum (inset,  Fig. 4A ) very close to the AMOC collapse. The  F ovS  minimum is at model year 1732 (1727 to 1740, 10 and 90% percentiles), and the AMOC tipping point, determined from break regression analysis [( 39 ); fig. S1], is at model year 1758 (1741 to 1775, 10 and 90% percentiles). Conceptual AMOC models ( 29 ,  40 ) clearly identify such a minimum with a saddle-node bifurcation ( 41 ), which is the AMOC tipping point in these models. At the  F ovS  minimum, an increment in the anomalous surface freshwater forcing weakens the AMOC further. The velocity changes are now dominating the  F ovS  response, while salinity changes primarily induce the negative  F ovS  response before the minimum. The weaker meridional velocities decrease the magnitude of  F ovS , and as  F ovS  is negative, this then results in a minimum. Therefore, the weaker AMOC carries then less salinity into the Atlantic Ocean, and the dominant balance between  F H  and  F ovS  changes cannot be sustained. This imbalance also results in the largest Atlantic freshwater content increase of 0.50 × 10 14  m 3  (∆ W ¯  between model years 1750 and 1726) during the first 1750 model years, which further destabilizes the AMOC. The tipping point is at slightly higher values of  F H  (and hence slightly later in the simulation) than the value at the  F ovS  minimum, so the latter is a lower bound for tipping. This is because the freshwater budget is not entirely balanced by  F ovS  changes under the freshwater forcing ( Fig. 4, B and C ). Although these responses under the surface freshwater forcing are fairly small compared to  F ovS  changes, they allow the existence of a near-equilibrium AMOC state for larger  F H  values than that at the  F ovS  minimum. An alternative explanation for the minimum is that since  F ovS  gets more negative from surface salinification (directly from − F H ) and since an AMOC collapse would cause  F ovS  to go toward zero (i.e., increase), there would be a minimum in  F ovS  at the start of the AMOC collapse. About 70% of the negative  F ovS  response (up to model year 1750) originates from freshwater transport changes in the upper 500 m at 34°S. The freshwater transport changes are dominated by the upper 500-m salinity responses (fig. S6) and can be connected to surface salinification (from − F H ). The North Atlantic Deep Water contributes another 20% to the negative  F ovS  response; the surface waters near the deep water formation regions freshen (through + F H ) and, after deep convection, influence the salinity properties of the North Atlantic Deep Water. This view suggests a passive role of  F ovS  in the AMOC collapse, and the  F ovS  minimum is then expected to coincide with the AMOC collapse. However, the  F ovS  minimum occurs 25 years (9 to 41, 10 and 90% percentiles) before the AMOC tipping event. The variability in  F ovS  also increases toward the  F ovS  minimum, indicating that the AMOC loses resilience and such behavior is typically found when approaching a saddle-node bifurcation. Bifurcation studies with idealized ocean-climate models also indicate that the  F ovS  minimum is found at lower values of the freshwater forcing than the AMOC tipping point ( 31 ,  32 ), which is providing support to the interpretation of the CESM results. The variability in  F ovS  increases when approaching the tipping point, and to reduce the variability in the time series, we fit 50 different cubic splines based on 50-year averages (each having a different starting year; see Materials and Methods and fig. S1, C and D). The  F ovS  mean over all the cubic splines is displayed in the inset of  Fig. 4A  (red curve). Using cubic splines allows us to adequately determine the time derivative of  F ovS  (indicated here by d t F ovS ). More interesting is to determine the  F ovS  minimum (i.e., d t F ovS  = 0), because the minimum is an important indicator of the approaching AMOC tipping point. We estimate the  F ovS  minimum using a limited part of the time series before the tipping point. Here, we use at least 100 years of the  F ovS  time series starting from model year 1500, and, for a given period, we simply linearly extrapolate d t F ovS  to find the point in time where d t F ovS  goes through zero. The tipping point estimate fails when analyzing only 100 years of “available” data (model years 1500 to 1600; available data in  Fig. 5A ). However, extending the available time series by adding “future” data (i.e., future data in  Fig. 5A ) to the analysis eventually results in a reliable  F ovS  minimum estimate. The result is also robust to the averaging interval when longer than 35 years ( Fig. 5B ). Fig. 5. F ovS  minimum estimate. ( A )  F ovS  minimum estimate procedure (here for 50-year averages, see Materials and Methods). The time derivative of  F ovS  (d t F ovS , red curve) is determined over the available and future data (up to model year 1695), and then a linear trend is determined (model years 1500 to 1695), which is extrapolated to find the zero (diamond label). ( B )  F ovS  minimum estimate for varying model years (i.e., available and future data, starting from model year 1500) and different averaging periods. The dotted lines and diamond label are similar to the ones from (A). The historical  F ovS , derived from reanalysis and assimilation products ( Fig. 6A ), are consistent in the sign of  F ovS  when comparing those to direct observations ( 36 ,  42 ). The reanalysis product mean shows a robust and significant negative  F ovS  trend (of −1.20 mSv year −1 ) over the past 40 years ( Fig. 6B ), and its magnitude is close to the projected CMIP6 mean trend [of −1.06 mSv year −1 , 2000–2100 ( 37 )] under a high-end climate change scenario. This multi-reanalysis mean negative trend suggests that the AMOC is on course to tipping as a more negative  F ovS  is associated with a stronger salt-advection feedback. Although the reanalysis products are known to have different biases ( 43 ), this trend estimate is the best result that can be obtained at the moment. However, these products are too short (maximum of ∼100 years) at the moment to adequately estimate the distance to the  F ovS  minimum. Fig. 6. Historical  F ovS  and trend. ( A ) Historical  F ovS  for five different reanalysis and assimilation products. The horizontal resolution for the ocean component and the time span is indicated in the legend. The  F ovS  multi-reanalysis mean (inset) is the yearly average over all available products. The yellow shading indicates observed ranges for  F ovS . ( B ) Present-day (1980 to 2022)  F ovS  trend. We use a sliding window (varying length of 20 to 43 years) over the available time series (1980 to 2022) to determine all  F ovS  trends and then determine the mean trend, which is displayed for each reanalysis product and the multi-reanalysis mean. The markers indicate the least significant [two-sided  t  test ( 23 )] trend for a given sliding window, and the trends at the maximum sliding window length (only one trend possible) are also displayed. By analyzing SST-based proxies of the AMOC strength ( 4 ), it was suggested that the real present-day AMOC approaches a tipping point ( 11 ,  12 ). On the basis of idealized models having a saddle-node bifurcation, an increase in both the variance and lag-1 autocorrelation (i.e., the classical early warning indicators) indicates that this bifurcation is approached. Following the same procedure as outlined in ( 11 ), on our AMOC tipping event in the CESM, we find no consistent increase in the classical early warning indicators for various 300-year periods before the AMOC collapse ( Fig. 7, A and B ). Shifting and varying the length of the windows analyzed here may eventually result in an increase in both early warning indicators, but over the full time series, these quantities decline when approaching the tipping point and, hence, are not reliable early warning indicators. Another method has been proposed recently to estimate the AMOC tipping point by fitting (and extrapolating) the lag-1 autocorrelation and variance statistics over the 150-year-long (monthly averaged) SST-based AMOC time series ( 12 ). Following the same procedure as outlined in ( 12 ), we find an estimate of the tipping point that is consistent with the timing of the  F ovS  minimum. This estimate is only accurate when both the variance and autocorrelation increase (e.g., model years 1427 to 1557, red curves in fig. S7). When shifting the time window, either variance or autocorrelation does not increase (e.g., model years 1503 to 1653, blue curves in fig. S7), resulting in inaccurate tipping point estimates. Because both variance and autocorrelation are increasing in the SST-based AMOC time series in ( 12 ), their estimate of the tipping point (2025 to 2095, 95% confidence level) could be accurate. On the other hand, our results (fig. S7) also show that the accuracy is sensitive to the time interval analyzed because of decadal variability in the SST time series and that most 150-year time windows do not provide an accurate estimate of the tipping point. Fig. 7. Classical early warning indicators. ( A ) Spatially averaged SST over the subpolar region (blue outlined region in inset) and AMOC strength (similar to  Fig. 1A ) before the AMOC collapse. The SST time series is averaged over the months November to May, where first the global mean SST [November to May ( 4 )] and then the time mean over the first 50 years are subtracted. ( B ) Variance and (lag-1) autocorrelation of the SST subpolar region for three 300-year periods. For each 300-year period, the linear trend is removed [red lines in (A)] before determining the variance and autocorrelation. The variance and autocorrelation are determined over a 70-year sliding window, and the significance of their trends (dashed lines) is indicated for each period [see ( 11 ) for more details]. ( C  and  D ) Similar to (B) but now for the (C) AMOC strength (A) and (D)  F ovS  ( Fig. 4A ). Using the classical early warning indicators directly on the AMOC strength time series ( Fig. 7C ) gives similar results as the SST time series. The trends over the 300-year periods are significant, but the overall variance and autocorrelation are decreasing toward the tipping point. Only for  F ovS  ( Fig. 7D ), we find a consistent and significant increase in its variance when approaching the tipping point, and this can also be directly observed from the full-time series ( Fig. 4A ). The quantity  F ovS , in particular its minimum in combination with its variance increase, is hence a very promising early warning signal for a (future) AMOC collapse."
72,discussion,"DISCUSSION The results here give a clear answer to a long-standing problem around in the climate research community concerning the existence of AMOC tipping behavior in GCMs ( 33 ,  44 – 48 ). Yes, it does occur in these models. This is bad news for the climate system and humanity as up until now one could think that AMOC tipping was only a theoretical concept and tipping would disappear as soon as the full climate system, with all its additional feedbacks, was considered. On the other hand, the tipping is consistent with the wealth of paleoclimate evidence that rapid changes have occurred in the AMOC, in particular during Dansgaard-Oeschger events ( 10 ). The AMOC collapse dramatically changes the redistribution of heat (and salt) and results in a cooling of the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere slightly warms. Atmospheric and sea-ice feedbacks, which were not considered in idealized climate models studies ( 29 ,  31 ,  32 ,  40 ), further amplify the AMOC-induced changes, resulting in a very strong and rapid cooling of the European climate with temperature trends of more than 3°C per decade. In comparison with the present-day global mean surface temperature trend (due to climate change) of about 0.2°C per decade, no realistic adaptation measures can deal with such rapid temperature changes under an AMOC collapse ( 49 ,  50 ). We have developed a physics-based, and observable ( 36 ,  42 ), early warning signal characterizing the tipping point of the AMOC: the minimum of the AMOC-induced freshwater transport at 34°S in the Atlantic, here indicated by  F ovS . The  F ovS  minimum occurs 25 years (9 to 41, 10 and 90% percentiles) before the AMOC tipping event. The quantity  F ovS  has a strong basis in conceptual models, where it is an indicator of the salt-advection feedback strength. Although  F ovS  has been shown to be a useful measure of AMOC stability in GCMs ( 51 ), the minimum feature has so far not been connected to the tipping point because an AMOC tipping event had up to now not been found in these models. The  F ovS  indicator is observable, and reanalysis products show that its value and, more importantly, its trend are negative at the moment. The latest CMIP6 model simulations indicate that  F ovS  is projected to decrease under future climate change ( 37 ). However, because of freshwater biases, the CMIP6  F ovS  mean starts at positive values and only reaches zero around the year 2075 ( 37 ). Hence, no salt-advection feedback–induced tipping is found yet in these models under climate change scenarios up to 2100 and longer simulations under stronger forcing would be needed (as we do here for the CESM) to find this. In observations, the estimated mean value of  F ovS  is already quite negative, and therefore, any further decrease is in the direction of a tipping point (and a stronger salt-advection feedback). A slowdown in the  F ovS  decline indicates that the AMOC tipping point is near. In addition, with future observations, an estimate of the distance to the AMOC tipping point can in principle be obtained. Deploying machine learning techniques on  F ovS , in combination with its variance, could also help in estimating the distance to AMOC tipping. We have shown that current reanalysis products provide insufficient information to adequately estimate this distance. Sustained future section measurements (available since 2009) at 34°S from the SAMoc Basin-wide Array (SAMBA) ( 52 – 54 ) are therefore of utmost importance and will become crucial to estimate the distance to an AMOC collapse. Given the different biases in reanalysis products ( 43 ) and uncertainties in future climate change, we are currently not able to determine a useful estimate of how many more years would be needed to make a reliable  F ovS  minimum estimate. In the CESM simulation here, AMOC tipping occurs at relatively large values of the freshwater forcing. This is due to biases in precipitation elsewhere in the models and mainly over the Indian Ocean ( 37 ). Hence, we needed to integrate the CESM to rather large values of the freshwater forcing [∼0.6 Sv, about a factor 80 times larger than the present-day melt rate of the Greenland Ice Sheet ( 55 )] to find the AMOC tipping event. The effect of the biases can be seen from the value of the AMOC-induced freshwater transport at 34°S,  F ovS , which is positive at the start of the simulation. When biases are corrected in the CESM, it is expected that the AMOC tipping is expected to occur at smaller values of the freshwater forcing. As also the present-day background climate state and the climate change forcing are different than in our simulations, the real present-day AMOC may be much closer to its tipping point than in the simulations shown here. Note that the analysis of the early warning signal is not affected by these biases, as this analysis is independent of the background state and precise forcing details."
73,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Climate model simulations The CESM (in the f19 g16 configuration) is a fully coupled climate model. The Parallel Ocean Program version 2 [POP2; ( 56 )] is used for the ocean component, the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 [CAM4; ( 57 )] is used for the atmosphere component, and the Community Ice Code version 4 [CICE4; ( 58 )] is used for the sea-ice component. The hosing experiment was branched off from the end (model year 2800) of the preindustrial CESM control simulation from Baatsen  et al.  ( 16 ). Here, it is shown that the upper 1000 m of the ocean is well equilibrated after 2800 years of model integration. 
The freshwater transport
 The total meridional freshwater transport ( F ∇ ) is decomposed into an overturning component ( F ov ) and an azonal (gyre) component ( F az ), which are determined as F ∇ ( y ) = − 1 S 0 ∫ − H 0 ∫ x W x E v ( S − S 0 ) dxdz (1a) F ov ( y ) = − 1 S 0 ∫ − H 0 [ ∫ x W x E v * dx ] [ ⟨ S ⟩ − S 0 ] dz (1b) F az ( y ) = − 1 S 0 ∫ − H 0 ∫ x W x E v ′ S ′ dxdz (1c) where  S 0  = 35 g kg −1  is a reference salinity.  v ∗  is defined as  v ∗  =  v  −  v ^  , where  v  is the meridional velocity and  v ^  is the section spatially averaged meridional velocity. The quantity ⟨ S ⟩ indicates the zonally averaged salinity, and primed quantities ( v ′ and  S ′) are deviations from their respective zonal means. The total freshwater transport also contains a barotropic and eddy (parameterized) component, but these contributions in the 1° ocean resolution CESM setup are very small ( 59 ) and therefore not included here. 
The freshwater budget
 The freshwater budget over the Atlantic Ocean (34°S to 60°N) is defined as d W ¯ dt = F ∇ b + F surf + F mix (2a) W ¯ = − 1 S 0 ∫ − H 0 ∫ 34 ∘ S 60 ∘ N ∫ x W x E ( S − S 0 ) dxdydz (2b) where  W ¯  is the freshwater content,  F ∇ b  is the freshwater convergence and is determined as the freshwater transport through the three boundaries (i.e., 34°S, 60°N, and the Strait of Gibraltar),  F surf  is the surface freshwater flux, and  F mix  is a residual term that closes the budget and captures, for example, diffusion ( 59 ). The Atlantic’s surface freshwater flux is primarily dominated by precipitation and evaporation but also includes runoff (river and land ice), sea-ice processes (melt and brine rejection), and the anomalous freshwater forcing ( F H ). 
The AMOC strength
 The AMOC strength is defined as the total meridional volume transport at 26°N over the upper 1000 m AMOC ( y = 26 ∘ N ) = ∫ − 1000 0 ∫ x W x E v   dxdz (3) 
F ovS  minimum estimate
 To estimate the  F ovS  minimum, we use cubic splines that interpolate piece-wise, between so-called knots, cubic polynomials that are twice continuously differentiable, and we impose that the second derivate is zero at the first and last knot. The knots are determined over  n -year averages of the  F ovS  time series for different starting years (1, 2, ...,  n  − 1; fig. S1C) and result in  n  different cubic splines (fig. S1D) and their respective derivatives (d t F ovS ). Using a linear fit over the cubic spline mean derivative, we estimate where the derivative goes through zero (i.e., the  F ovS  minimum;  Fig. 5 ). A minimum of  n  ≥ 35 (year averages and cubic splines) is required to substantially reduce the variability of the time series and find a consistent  F ovS  minimum estimate.

75,materials|methods,"Materials and Methods Study Area. Laguna Llaviucu (Lake Llaviucu, 2°50′34″S, 79°8′43″W) lies within Cajas National Park, southern Ecuadorian Andes ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). This region was shaped by glaciers and contains hundreds of glacial lakes. Typically, bedrock is thick Quaternary silicic ignimbrite, rhyolite, and Tarqui formation ( 76 ). Laguna Llaviucu is an exorheic lake with an area of ~0.2 km 2  and a depth of 16.5 m. Water temperatures stays at ~12 °C until at least 12 m depths on June 3, 1988 ( 77 ). The upper ~11 m water column is oxygenated, and it is likely because of mixing by inflow and outflow ( 77 ). Laguna Llaviucu lies on the eastern Andean flank where the climate is wet with mean annual precipitation exceeding 2,000 mm and a marked (June to September) dry season. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 12 °C and temperatures in the Cajas National Park show little seasonal variation other than diurnal changes. Sediment Core Collection and Age-Depth Model. A 12.1-m sediment core (Llav09) from Laguna Llaviucu was collected using a Colinvaux-Vohnout piston sampler in June 2009. All tubes were capped and sealed in the field and then shipped to the Florida Institute of Technology. All cores were stored in a dark cold room (4 °C) until analysis. To determine the chronology at Llaviucu, we used 14 radiocarbon ( 14 C) dates based on sediment bulk samples. A core, LLA-15, raised about 50 m southeast from Llav09 had a  210 Pb activity profile that showed a very slow sedimentation rate. We cross-correlated a distinctive peak of  Discostella  in the LLA-15 and Llav09 records at 2 cm depth (2.5 cm depth in the LLA-15 record) to allow us to adopt a  210 Pb activity profile for the uppermost 2 cm of this core ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ). At 1,198 cm, a second correlation between a speleothem δ 18 O record from Santiago cave and our  n- alkane δ 2 H record was used to constrain the age at the base of our age model. One  14 C dating reversal (OS-77396, depth 997, age 12,150 ± 50) was excluded to improve model fit. Calibration of  14 C ages used the IntCal20 calibration curve ( 78 ) and, together with the  210 Pb data and speleothem correlation, formed a chronology using “Bacon” in R ( 79 ,  80 ) with linear interpolations at the top of the core and a Bayesian age-depth model that incorporates uncertainties in both radiocarbon and model ages ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 ). The age-depth model has an average 1σ uncertainty of 154 ± 79, and the interval from 11.7 to 14.5 k cal BP has a 1σ uncertainty of 161 ± 53. To justify the robustness of this age-depth model, we tested the age-depth model with different calibrations (N. Hemisphere vs. S. Hemisphere) and different estimates of the basal age of the sediment core ( SI Appendix , Fig. S7 ). We observed that the selection of using N. and S. Hemisphere calibrations (IntCal20 and SHCal20) has minimal effects on our records. The biggest impact on the age model comes from the choice of the tie-point at the base of the sediment succession. This impacts the timing of the onset of the millennial-scale cooling that we associate with the ACR by ~200 y but is insufficient to move the millennial-scale cooling to the start of the YD ( SI Appendix , Fig. S7 ). Therefore, our age-depth model is adequate to determine the ages of millennial-scale events of YD and ACR. Lipid Biomarker Analysis. A total of 121 samples were subsampled from the cores at every 10 cm with an average sampling resolution of ~60-y and ~200-y from 16.8 to 12.9 k cal BP, and 12.9 k cal BP to core-top, respectively. We freeze-dried and homogenized all samples, then acquired the total lipid extract (TLE) using a Dionex accelerated solvent extractor 350 with a solution of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) (1:1, v/v). The TLE was further separated into apolar and polar fractions with alumina oxide column chromatography, and hexane/DCM (9:1, v/v) and DCM/MeOH (1:1, v/v) as mobile phases. To measure leaf wax stable isotopes, we purified all apolar fractions with silver nitrate silica gel chromatography with hexane. The  n -alkane concentrations were determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The concentrations were used to calculate suitable dilutions for isotope measurements aiming for a ~4.5 V peak intensity. The δ 2 H of C 31 
 n -alkane for a total of 121 samples was measured on a Thermo Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to a Thermo Trace 1310 GC through a ConFlo IV. The δ 13 C of C 31 
 n -alkane for a total of 25 samples was measured on a Thermo Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 6890 GC through a Finnigan GCC III. All samples were measured in triplicate, bracketed by three injections of reference gas, with laboratory standards injections between each sample to track and correct intersample drift. Sample δ 2 H ratios are shown in per mil (‰) relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). Sample δ 13 C ratios are shown in per mil (‰) relative to Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB). To measure brGDGTs, we dissolved all polar fractions in hexane/isopropanol (99:1, v/v), and filtered the samples through 0.45-µm PTFE syringe filters. Then we analyzed all filtered samples on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC coupled to an Agilent 6130 quadrupole mass selective detector following the method ( 81 ) that can differentiate the 5- and 6-methyl brGDGT isomers. Selected ion monitoring mode was used to scan for mass/charge ratios of 1,302, 1,300, 1,298, 1,296, 1,292, 1,050, 1,048, 1,046, 1,036, 1,034, 1,032, 1,022, 1,020, and 1,018. We used the previously established MBT′ 5ME  (methylation of 5-methyl branched tetraethers) index ( 31 ,  32 ) and newly developed pantropical temperature calibration ( 33 ) to reconstruct temperatures from Laguna Llaviucu: [1] MBT ′ 5 ME = ( Ia + Ib + Ic ) / ( Ia + Ib + Ic + IIa + IIb + IIc + IIIa ) , 
 [2] MAAT = - 1.78 + 31.01 × MBT ′ 5 ME . This calibration has a RMS error of 2.26 °C ( 33 ). Temperature Reconstruction Based on brGDGTs. brGDGTs contain alkyl core chains with four to six methyl groups and zero to two cyclopentyl moieties ( 31 ,  82 ,  83 ). These compounds are ubiquitous in a wide range of terrestrial environments ( 84 ). Although the organisms responsible for brGDGTs production in lakes remain unknown, recent research points to production by Acidobacteria ( 85 – 87 ). When the ambient temperature changes, the brGDGT producers could alter their lipid membranes’ composition to maintain appropriate fluidity and permeability. Therefore, fossil brGDGTs can be used to reconstruct past temperatures. Our recent calibration work shows a unified response between brGDGT to MAAT from the pantropical regions ( 33 ). Specifically, the new brGDGT dataset from tropical South America validates the application of lacustrine brGDGTs in paleotemperature reconstruction in this region ( 33 ). In addition to the MBT’ 5ME  calibration (Eq.  2 ), we also test the multivariate linear regression (MLR) calibration ( 33 ) [3] MAAT = - 4.11 + 31.63 × f ( I a ) + 64.50 × f ( I b ) + 32.28 × f ( I I a ′ ) . Both reconstructions show almost identical structures and both surface datapoints are close to the observed MAAT value ( SI Appendix , Fig. S8 ). Given the MLR model is thought to be lacking a well-defined underlying biophysiological mechanism, whereas the correlation between MBT′ 5ME  and temperature has been found in culture studies ( 86 ), we report our temperature based on the MBT’ 5ME  calibration but argue this similar structure further improve the creditableness of using brGDGTs to reconstruct temperatures from Laguna Llaviucu. Hydroclimate Reconstruction Based on δ 2 H of C 31 
 n -Alkane. n -Alkanes, saturated unbranched acyclic hydrocarbons with the chemical formula C n H 2n+2 , form the waxy surface of plant leaves. The  n -alkanes with long-chain length are mainly synthesized by terrestrial plants as a coating to protect from water loss ( 88 ). The  n -alkanes are primarily sourced from the plant’s source water. Therefore, δ 2 H of fossil  n -alkanes can be used to infer the source water’s isotope signatures in the past ( 89 ). This proof of concept is further tested by Feakins et al. ( 37 ). In the Andes and Amazon, δ 2 H of plant  n -alkanes have been found strongly correlated with the time-averaged precipitation’s hydrogen isotopes ( 37 ). Furthermore, based on Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) data from the closest station (CUENCA, 2°52′59.99″S, 78°58′59.99″W,  SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ), δ 2 H of precipitation is significantly negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). Taken together, more depleted (enriched) δ 2 H values of  n -alkanes represent more (less) precipitations. Fornace et al. ( 34 ) generated a C 28 
 n -alkanoic acid hydrogen isotope record from Lake Titicaca, Central Andes, to reconstruct hydrologic variability. Their record generally tracks other stalagmite oxygen isotopes, supporting the notion of using sedimentary leaf wax δ 2 H to infer past hydroclimate in this region ( 34 ). Here, we report δ 2 H of C 31 
 n -alkanes as the indicator of hydroclimate and note modern observational data support the use of  n -alkanes over the  n -alkanoic acids as the proxy to reconstruct hydroclimate variability ( 37 ). Significant Correlation between Llaviucu δ 2 H and Santiago Cave δ 18 O Records. Our δ 2 H record has a ~200-y resolution from 12.9 k cal BP to core-top, and ~60-y resolution from the bottom to 12.9 k cal BP, whereas the Santiago cave record has a resolution of ~50-y and ~70-y during those two intervals. To calculate the correlation between these records, we interpolated both records at 10-y resolution and then calculated bin averages to acquire 200-y resolution records from 12.9 to 6.3 k cal BP ( N  = 34) and 100-y records from 16.8 to 12.9 k cal BP ( N  = 39). Following this resampling the two records are significantly correlated ( Fig. 2 B ). It is worth noting that both records have different dating methods, further suggesting our Llaviucu records’ chronology is sufficiently accurate to document the timing of millennial-scale climate events in this region."

80,introduction,"Introduction Global warming, through its impact on ocean stratification and O 2  solubility, is driving the decline in marine oxygen inventory both at depth and in the subsurface with potentially catastrophic consequences for marine biological production, ecosystem and habitat sustainability 1 , 2 . Total oxygen inventory has already declined by 2% since 1960 and deoxygenation is predicted to accelerate over the rest of the century 3 . One of the effects of decreased oxygenation in the ocean is the rapid expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) with implications for marine N 2 O production, marine fixed-nitrogen inventory, biological productivity, as well as the ability of the ocean to sequester carbon away from the atmosphere through the biological carbon pump mechanism 4 . The combined effect of these processes would represent positive feedback on global warming by enhancing greenhouse gas efflux from the ocean 4 . The North and Tropical (North and South) Pacific accounts for up to 40% of the existing and forecasted oxygen loss and hosts the largest OMZs in the ocean 3 . Multidecadal climatic variability such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) or the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) have been shown to modulate the declining oxygen concentration trends over recent decades in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, via temperature or ventilation effects, respectively 1 , 3 , 5 . The decrease in oxygen and increase in denitrification (enabled by the lack of oxygen) in the North Pacific OMZs since the late 1970s has been linked to a shift from a negative to a positive phase of the PDO (Fig.  1 ) 6 – 8 . Intriguingly, similar trends of historical O 2  anomalies in the ETNP and the AMO index are also observed over the last 60 years (Fig.  1 ). However, these instrumental records of marine oxygen and climatology are short, only dating back to the 1960s, making it hard to ground truth the apparent relationship between these multidecadal climate oscillations and marine deoxygenation. Crucially, the frequency, sign and amplitude of these climatic oscillations are expected to evolve under warming conditions 9 , making it essential to understand their impact on marine oxygen for future prediction. In this regard, our lack of knowledge of the natural variability in marine oxygen inventory in the pre-industrial past remains one of the main challenges in predicting future declines in oxygen concentration 2 . This can be resolved by looking at past archives of marine oxygenation changes. Fig. 1 The North Pacific oxygen minimum zone. A  Map of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) and core site (star). Oxygen content at 200 m was drawn using Ocean Data View (ODV 46 ) from World Ocean Atlas 2013 data.  B  Change in oxygen anomaly in ETNP OMZ since 1960 (CalCOFI data, modified from ref.  6 ) compared to time series of observed annual-mean low-pass filtered.  C  Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO, °C) index (HadISST data), and  D  standardised annual-mean Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index during 1950–2012 ( http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest ). All data were linearly detrended prior to the analysis. The analysis focuses on decadal or longer scale variability, isolated by applying a low-pass Lanczos filter with a cut-off frequency of 10 years to the detrended data. In OMZs, past changes in deoxygenation can be reconstructed by measuring nitrogen isotopes in the sediments 10 , 11 . Nitrogen isotopic signal in these areas has been shown to record the intensity of denitrification, a process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. In this study, we reconstruct denitrification changes, as a natural marker of deoxygenation, in an annually varved sedimentary records from the Gulf of California (GoC), Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP), covering key periods over the last Glacial–interglacial cycle (55 Ka BP). This annually resolved denitrification record reveals the global and regional mechanisms and climatic controls on oxygen variability in the largest OMZ at subdecadal to multidecadal timescales. The GoC is located at the core of the North Pacific OMZ. The lack of oxygen in the subsurface and intermediate water column (200–800 m) is created by high seasonal productivity and organic matter export through the water column coupled with old ventilation ages of the water within and below the thermocline. The resulting anoxia (O 2  < 0.2 ml l −1  12 ) drives high level of denitrification in the basin year round 13 . In OMZs, denitrification is the main process governing fixed-nitrogen (mainly nitrate) loss 14 . Like most biogeochemical processes, it involves isotopic fractionation and therefore its intensity can be measured using relative nitrogen isotope abundance (δ 15 N) 6 , 14 . In the GoC, seasonal alternation between terrigenous (riverine) and biogenic inputs to the seabed, anoxic bottom waters at sea floor lead to the rapid deposition and preservation of annually varved sedimentary sequences. Such conditions produce a unique opportunity to track past changes in deoxygenation on annual timescales. We previously presented a continuous 55,000 year-long record of denitrification in a composite sediment core (MD02-2515 piston and corresponding MD02-2517 CASQ cores form the same site, 27°29.01 N; 112°04.46 W; 881 m water depth) in the Guaymas basin at centennial timescales (Fig.  2 ) 15 , 16 . We now present nitrogen isotope (δ 15 N) data from 10 annually subsampled, continuously varved sections, each spanning about 200 years, in order to reconstruct interannual to multidecadal variability in marine hypoxia in the ETNP. These annually resolved sections represent key climatic periods from the last glacial period to the recent pre-industrial epoch. Fig. 2 Denitrification changes in the Gulf of California. A  Long-term δ 15 N (‰) record at core site MD02-2515/17 showing changes in deoxygenation-related denitrification over the last 55,000 years, with position and δ 15 N range of the 10 annually resolved record (red and blue triangles).  B  Annually resolved (blue circles) and 3-year averaged (solid line) 200 year-long δ 15 N (‰) record for section #10 showing interannual to multidecadal variability in deoxygenation around 14,500 BP. The error bars are within the circles and triangles. Although the GoC is a semi-enclosed basin, existing denitrification records spanning the last 150 years show that the signal recorded in the basin is representative of the Northern Pacific OMZ 6 . While temporal resolution in the published 150 year-long records varies between 3 and 1 year, our varved records provide annual resolution [ S1 ], enabling spectral analyses to be performed to document the natural variability in deoxygenation in the ETNP not only in the recent past but under various climate states (glacial period, millennial scale events and the Holocene) throughout the late Pleistocene (Fig.  2 ). Strongly reoccurring climate oscillations cause physical and biogeochemical fluctuations in the North and Tropical Pacific at subdecadal to multidecadal times scales 17 – 19 . These climatic oscillations have well-documented impacts on surface and subsurface circulation, mixing, nutrient supply and biological productivity in the ETNP where our core is located and have the potential to modulate the oxygen budget in the basin and in the OMZs 13 , 20 – 22 . El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) involves zonal changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and currents across the equatorial and tropical Pacific at subdecadal times scales (2–8 years) 18 . The PDO is a low-frequency (50 years and 20–25 years 23 ) climate oscillation centred over the mid-latitudes in the North Pacific and affects North Pacific SSTs and mixing. The PDO is not a single mode of climatic oscillation and is described increasingly as the sum of processes and climatic oscillations that operate across the Pacific, such as ENSO and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) 23 . The NPGO has a periodicity of about 10 years and is reflected by changes in the intensity of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyre circulations 19 . Recent studies increasingly identify the links between temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic (AMO) and climatic oscillations, atmospheric perturbations and changes in ocean circulation in distant regions (e.g., Asian monsoon) 24 – 26  in the tropics and sub-tropics. Crucially, anomalously warm temperatures in the North Atlantic are found to lead to a northward shift of the ITCZ and a positive wind stress curl anomaly in the subtropical Pacific. This impacts the shallow overturning circulation in the tropical Pacific 24 , with possible impacts on the PDO and NPGO. The AMO varies with periodicities of about 70–80 years (with a 35-year harmonic) 27 , 28 . While we acknowledge ongoing debates on the nature (internal variability versus externally forced) and stability of these climatic oscillations over time, our results show the recurrence and persistence of modes of variability similar in frequencies to modern AMO, PDO, NPGO and ENSO over the last 55,000 BP 29 ."
81,results,"Results We carried out time-series analyses in the frequency domain using spectral analyses with several windowing settings and wavelet transform (see section “Methods”) on each of the annually resolved denitrification records. In the first instance, we used band-pass filtering to remove the periodicities over 70 years, hence compromising the detection of the longest periodicities at which PDO and AMO are known to operate today. A subsequent analysis was carried out on non-filtered records to identify the potential occurrence and power of the longest AMO and PDO periodicities. Pacific climate oscillations in the deoxygenation records All filtered records share the same dominant periodicities of 25 years followed by a periodicity of 10 years (±2 years) and minor periodicities between 3 and 8 years. On average, the power was 2.6 (±0.6) times greater for the 25 years periodicity compared to the 3–8 years periodicities and 1.8 (±0.8) time greater than that of the 10–12-year periodicity. In other words, anoxia-related denitrification changes in the ETNP responded mainly to multidecadal oscillations at periodicities similar to the shorter periodicity displayed by today’s PDO climate variability (48%) than it did to shorter climate oscillations such as ENSO-like (3–8 years,18%) and NPGO-like (10–12 years, 34%) variabilities. For all filtered 200 year-long records ( n  = 10), the main mode of variability is the PDO-like multidecadal oscillation (20–25 years) while ENSO-type periodicities are consistently the weakest mode of variability expressed by the deoxygenation proxy (Supplementary Table  1 ). AMO-like signal in the North Pacific deoxygenation records The spectral analyses performed on non-filtered records reveal that periodicities centred around 83 and 31–35 years are both seen in the Holocene (sections #III and #2) and Bølling-Allerød (sections #9 and #10) sections ( n  = 4, Fig.  3 ). These periodicity “doublets” are found consistently across the warm climatic periods and are identical to the ones recorded in Holocene varves from Icelandic lakes 28 . Model Intercomparison (CMIP5) of AMO historical simulations (last 150 years) also shows periodicities between 70–90 years and around 30 years to be typical of AMO variability 27  (Fig.  3 ). During the Dansgaard–Oeshger events of Isotopic Stage 3, AMO-like periodicities are also observed in three of the four records (records #46, #47 and #50) but show a wider range of duration (60–100 years and 31–37 years) than those observed during the Holocene and BA (Supplementary Table  1 ). For all these records, the amplitudes (power) of AMO-like periodicities vary within a range similar to that of the PDO-like periods extracted from the corresponding filtered and unfiltered records (see above), indicating that AMO-like variability can explain a significant part of the oxygen changes in the basin. Fig. 3 Interannual to multidecadal variability in denitrification. A  Spectral analyses for the four Holocene and deglacial nitrogen isotope annually resolved (not filtered) records show the prominence of the AMO-like and PDO-like periodicities during warm periods.  B  The wavelet analyses on the same records confirm this trend, as shown here for section 2. The AMO-like periodicity “doublets” appear less clearly, however, during the Heinrich Event 1 (#17) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, #26) records when different modes of multidecadal variability are found (41 years and <125 years, respectively). This suggests that during glacial stages and stadials, when North Atlantic climate was much colder and the Atlantic meridional circulation slowed down dramatically or even collapsed 30 , the AMO might have been fundamentally different to what it is during warm climatic phases, both in nature and frequency. In addition, cold climatic periods of the past such as the LGM and Heinrich 1 were characterised by a contraction of the main OMZs and arguably punctuated by transient oxygenated conditions in parts of the OMZs 11 . The annually resolved denitrification records #26 and to a lesser extent #17 show higher amplitude variations in δ 15 N than the other annually resolved records and the occurrence of lighter values, atypical of denitrifying conditions (Fig.  2 ). This suggests that at these times, denitrification was not always the primary driver of δ 15 N changes in the GoC because oxygenated conditions prevailed, contrary to today’s situation 13  and the warm millennial scale events that characterise the other annual records. The significant negative correlation between denitrification and biological productivity for section #26 confirms the assumption that δ 15 N during cold periods denotes changes in nitrate utilisation and/or availability rather than denitrification under low oxygen conditions 31  (Supplementary Fig.  4 )."
82,discussion,"Discussion Our results show PDO- and AMO-like periodicities dominate the annually resolved denitrification/deoxygenation records in the ETNP while the shorter variabilities similar to NPGO and ENSO have a minor influence on the signal. In Fig.  1 , we compare AMO and PDO indices with the 1950–2010 record of oxygen anomalies, reflecting the observed variability in the volume of anoxic waters in the ETNP OMZ over the last 6 decades. This comparison offers the insight that PDO and AMO may be dominant climate variabilities that drive oxygenation changes in the subsurface of the GoC. Our spectral analyses on annually resolved denitrification signals confirm this relationship and extend it back in time, into the pre-industrial Holocene and Pleistocene. While the NPGO and ENSO affect primarily nutrient supply to the ETNP upwelling by modulating the intensity of the North Pacific Gyre or the local upwelling rate, respectively 19 , 32 , the PDO and AMO can impact temperature, stratification, surface and subsurface circulation in the North and Equatorial Pacific at greater spatial scale 8 . Our results suggest that local upwelling changes and nutrient supply to the GoC, modulated by ENSO- and/or NPGO-type climatic processes, have a marginal influence on the volume of deoxygenated waters in the subsurface. Annually resolved records of biogenic silica accumulation (BioSi wt% per year) were also reconstructed from the sections studied for nitrogen isotopes. Biogenic silica accumulation in the Guaymas Basin sediments has been shown to be tightly controlled by upwelling strength and seasonal productivity in the sea surface, with high BioSi accumulation occurring during upwelling-induced productive events 16 , 33  and therefore can be a proxy for upwelling, biogenic export and, indirectly, oxidant demand (Supplementary Note  2 ). Cross-correlation analyses and coherence spectra between corresponding annually resolved denitrification and biogenic silica accumulation records show no significant relationship (correlation coefficient ≤0.4; Supplementary Fig.  4 ), either positive or negative, between both parameters. In addition, there is no identifiable, systematic time lag between biogenic silica fluctuations and denitrification changes at annual to decadal timescale that could indicate a delay in the response of denitrification to change in oxidant demands and could mask any potential covariation. In addition, band-pass filtering analyses on the annually resolved records of biogenic opal and δ 15 N (Table  1 ) reveal that on average periodicities longer than 10 years (PDO-, AMO-like) account for 67% of the variability for the detrended δ 15 N records versus 33% for shorter periodicities (10 years and below, NPGO- and ENSO-like), while periodicities shorter than or equal to 10 years explain 55% of the biogenic silica variability in the detrended records. This result points to separate mechanisms controlling local upwelling and productivity levels on one hand and deoxygenation-induced denitrification on the other (Table  1 ). Table 1 Band-pass filtering analyses on the annually resolved records of biogenic silica and δ 15 N are used to highlight the relative contribution of multidecadal compared to interannual modes of oscillation to productivity and deoxygenation variability Biogenic silica Nitrogen isotopic signal Sections Period ≤ 10 years Period > 10 years Period ≤ 10 years Period > 10 years # III 61.8% 38.2% 34.8% 65.2% # 2 56.6% 43.4% 30.8% 69.2% # 10 73.1% 26.9% 34.1% 65.9% # 17 37.4% 62.6% 32.9% 67.1% # 26 65.7% 34.3% 37.8% 62.2% # 45 38.0% 58.0% 30.6% 69.4% # 46 52.1% 47.9% 31.7% 68.3% # 47 57.2% 42.8% 37.7% 62.3% # 50 51.0% 49.0% 22.7% 77.3% Average 54.8% 44.8% 32.6% 67.4% Therefore, time-series, cross-correlation and band-pass filtering analyses on our annually resolved records all corroborate the hypothesis that local upwelling-induced productivity is not the primary control on oxygen levels and denitrification variability in the OMZ of the GoC. We argue that the competing effects of diapycnal mixing and biological respiration on oxygen concentration, both resulting from upwelling dynamics 1 , mostly cancel each other out, producing only a small and variable net impact on the subsurface marine oxygen budget in the Guaymas Basin and ETNP. This is consistent with published sediment trap data from the ETNP showing that during a recent pronounced El Nino event (1992–1993), productivity decreased drastically (markedly low biogenic silica export) in response to ENSO-driven stratification and resulted in only a slight decline in denitrification intensity (0.1–0.2‰ in δ 15 N signal). This indicates that the net result of lower oxidant demand and stronger surface stratification on subsurface oxygen content is very small in the GoC. These historical results confirm our finding that over the late Pleistocene, oxygen and denitrification in the ETNP are not controlled by interannual changes in oxidant demand triggered by upwelling conditions locally but by more widespread changes in oxygen supply, either via changing oxidant demands in source waters further afield or slowdown/acceleration of the subsurface ventilation operating at multidecadal timescales. The PDO has been put forward as the main control on natural oxygen variability in the Pacific OMZ by several studies using mainly model simulations. These simulations found either variations in isopycnal movements in the tropical Pacific, shifts in the trade winds or large-scale changes in oxidant demand induced by the PDO as potential processes leading to oxygen changes 7 , 8 , 34 . While these model simulations offer insights into the potential mechanisms via which the PDO can influence mid-depth oxygen in the ETNP, they have so far ignored the potential role of the AMO. However, our extensive proxy-based data set points to both the AMO and the PDO as potential primary drivers for deoxygenation in the Pacific OMZ during the Pleistocene, with a minor influence from local biological productivity. In order to offer a mechanistic model for the role of the AMO and PDO on oxygen supply to the North Pacific OMZ via the surface and subsurface current systems, we use SST and subsurface circulation (at the EUC core depth, Supplementary Note  4 ) data reanalysis regressed on the positive AMO and PDO phases between 1950 and 2010 in Fig.  4 . The time-series output of the maximum zonal velocity  u  (eastward) of the Equatorial Under Current (EUC) over the same time period is plotted in Fig.  5 . Fig. 4 North Pacific temperature and current velocity anomalies. Regressions of observed low-pass filtered annual-mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs, °C) on the  A  positive AMO and  B  positive PDO indices shown in Fig.  1  during 1950–2012. All data were linearly detrended prior to the analysis. SST data are from the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset version 1 at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. The cross-hatching marks regions where the correlation exceeds the 95% confidence level, estimated by using a Monte Carlo approach with 1000 random samples of the time series. Blue–red colours denote velocity anomalies of observed low-pass filtered annual-mean ocean currents (m s − 1 ) at 96 m below the surface regressed on the  C  positive AMO and  D  positive PDO indices shown in Fig.  1  during 1950–2008. The contours denote the mean climatological current velocity at the same depth. All data were linearly detrended prior to the analysis. Oceanic current data are from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) dataset version v2p2p4 at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. Fig. 5 Current velocity and oxygen changes. Time series of  A  the gradient in Equatorial Under Current (EUC) maximum velocity between the western (120° E–150° W) and eastern (150°–100° W) equatorial Pacific,  B  EUC annual zonal maximum velocity (eastward) within 150°–90° W; 2° S–2° N and between 90 and 300 m below the surface from 1950 to 2010 (SODA data reanalyses as in Fig.  4 ), AMO ( C ) and PDO ( D ) indices (as in Fig.  1 ) and  E  oxygen anomalies in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) based on the CalCOFI dataset 34 . Redish colour means more oxygen is present in the subsurface. During negative AMO phase (blue), stronger EUC and decreased equatorial biological productivity result in increased oxygen supply to the ETNP. During negative PDO phases (blue), upwelling strength increases in the ETNP resulting in increased oxidant demand and diapycnal mixing. SST anomalies (Fig.  4B ) regressed on positive PDO (PDO+) phases show an East–West temperature gradient with warm SST anomalies in the eastern part of the North Pacific basin. This pattern is characteristic of decreased upwelling and surface productivity (lower oxidant demand), and increased stratification (lower O 2  supply from diapycnal mixing) in the ETNP. The SSTs regressed on the positive AMO (AMO+) phase in the North Pacific manifest as a North–South gradient with cooler temperature anomalies in the equatorial region denoting increased upwelling forced by the acceleration of Walker circulation and the trade winds (Fig.  4A ) 25 . Our reanalyses of subsurface circulation data (SODA, 1960–2010) at the EUC core depth regressed on PDO+ and AMO+ indicate that AMO+ correlates with a slowdown of the eastward EUC current as represented by negative (westward) velocity anomalies (blue colour) in the equatorial region (Fig.  4C ), notably in its termination in the easternmost part of the basin. This is corroborated by the record of historical changes in the EUC max velocity between 1950 and 2012 (Fig.  5B ). Subsurface circulation in the equatorial zone of the Pacific regressed on a positive PDO phase does not display a clear trend as shown by both red and blue colour in the equatorial region and with velocity anomalies one order of magnitude smaller than the AMO regressed velocity anomalies. Our reanalysis indicates a slight increase in EUC velocity during PDO+ in the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific subsurface (red colour) but the PDO seems to have a comparatively smaller impact on the EUC velocity (Fig.  4D ). This data reanalysis points to the AMO as the dominant climate oscillation influencing the EUC strength over the last 60 years. However, equatorial circulation and SSTs anomalies mapped in Fig.  4  imply that PDO and AMO, when in opposite phase, can have additive effects on Northern Hemisphere temperatures and circulation, and ultimately on ocean deoxygenation. For instance, both AMO+ and PDO− drive increased Northern Hemisphere temperatures, which would lower the oxygen content of the water subducted in the North Pacific. In addition, thermally stratified conditions in the North Pacific can further reduce mixing of oxygen below the thermocline 3 . The circulation changes highlighted by our analysis are unexpected: during AMO+ the equatorial upwelling and westward equatorial surface transport are invigorated 26  (Fig.  4A ). Such conditions would foster an increase in productivity and oxidant demand in the subsurface along the equatorial Pacific and result in an increase in oxygen consumption in the EUC going eastward. At the same time, strong trade winds would strengthen the zonal circulation and EUC transport during AMO+. Surprisingly, our EUC velocity data reanalysis shows the opposite trend. The time series (Fig.  5B ) showing the maximum eastward velocity of the EUC (SODA annual-mean velocity in the upper 300 m, 10° N–10° S latitude, 160° E–90° W longitudes) from 1950 to 2012 reveals that maximum increases in EUC velocity, especially in the eastern part of the basin, coincide with the most negative AMO index while decreases in the EUC velocity tend to occur during positive AMO phases, and to a lesser extent with negative PDO phases, confirming the spatial trend in positive AMO+ and PDO+ regressed circulation presented in Fig.  4 . Similarly, our estimates of the EUC mass transport over the period 1880–2012 (Supplementary Note  4 ) confirm that eastward equatorial transport increases during AMO− phases and doubles during the latest AMO− compared to AMO+ phase. Such change in the EUC volume transport would drastically enhance oxygen advection to the eastern Pacific. We calculate Δ u  as the difference in EUC maximum zonal velocity between the western (140° E–170° W) and eastern (170° W–100° W) equatorial Pacific between 1950–2012 (Fig.  5A ) and 1880–2012 (Supplementary Figs.  7  and  8 ). The velocity gradient Δ u  increases and decreases in tandem with shifts in the AMO phase and shows a strengthening of the eastward acceleration of the EUC during AMO−. Momentum budget models suggest that the EUC is slowed down by the friction exerted by the westward flowing surface current fuelled by the trade winds in the eastern Pacific 35 . Shifts in the AMO have been shown to strongly correlate with SST anomalies and trade winds intensity in the western equatorial Pacific 25 , 26  while existing ocean and atmospheric data reanalyses in the tropical Pacific have stressed the role of the trade winds in modulating shallow overturning in the tropical Pacific 36 . Collectively these studies suggest stronger equatorial upwelling and shallow overturning under the influence of invigorated trade winds during AMO+, but the westward friction in the surface on the eastward flowing EUC directly below acts as a brake, slowing down the EUC and reducing the eastward transport of oxygenated waters from the western part of the basin (Fig.  6A ) 35 . At the same time, productivity intensifies in the invigorated equatorial upwelling, increasing the oxidant demand in the subsurface. Both effects combine to lessen oxygen supply to the eastern equatorial and tropical Pacific. Conversely, this mechanism explains why the negative phase of the AMO coincides with an increase in oxygen concentration in the ETNP/GoC (Figs.  5  and  6B ) and equatorial Pacific 3 . Fig. 6 Schematic summary. Impact of  A  positive and  B  negative AMO phases on North Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs, SODA, from Fig.  4 ) and stratification, equatorial biological productivity and oxidant demand, and the Equatorial Under Current (EUC) eastward velocity (SODA). Strong stratification in the North Pacific surface during positive AMO ( A ) results in warmer SSTs and decreased oxygen penetration into the western EUC 3 , decreased stratification in the Equatorial Pacific promotes biological productivity (orange dots) and oxidant demand in the East while reduced EUC eastward transport limits oxygen supply to the eastern tropical Pacific resulting in the expansion of the eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). The anomalies are reversed during negative AMO phases ( B ). Water column oxygen was drawn using Ocean Data View (ODV 46 ) from World Ocean Atlas 2013 data. Until now, the PDO was put forward as the main driver of deoxygenation changes at decadal to multidecadal timescales in the ETNP 6 – 8 , 37 . Previous studies have linked changes in the PDO phase with shifts in the meridional Pacific subtropical cell (STC), which brings oxygen and nutrient-rich water equatorward from the North along the thermocline in the ETNP 8 . The surface North Pacific circulation (N and S equatorial current) is weakened during PDO+. The net effect of both increased stratification (lower O 2  supply) and decreased productivity (lower oxidant demand) in the East on O 2  concentrations in the subsurface ocean is unclear as both mechanisms have opposite effects, as noted by Duteil et al. 8 . Conversely, during negative PDO phases, the eastern boundary current upwelling is invigorated. Increased productivity causes higher oxidant demands but a concomitant increase in vertical mixing and subsurface circulation would boost O 2  supply to the ETNP. Ito et al. 7  propose that the PDO can influence subsurface O 2  concentrations in the ETNP via changes in the isopycnal heave whereby the shallowing of the thermocline depth brings cold, oxygen-poor waters to the subsurface in the ETNP. However, PDO-related changes in the isopycnal heave primarily impact vertical O 2  mixing and distribution between the subsurface and deeper water locally rather than oxygen supply to the ETNP 7 . We argue that the impact of the PDO on the meridional STC and/or isopycnal heave influences surface productivity and/or oxygen supply in ways that may partly counteract each other yielding a modest impact on oxygen levels in the ETNP. Our data reanalyses show that the impact of the PDO on the large-scale zonal subsurface circulation in the equatorial and tropical region is ambiguous or small (Figs.  4  and  5 ). Although marginal in its impact, we suggest that the PDO can nevertheless act in synergy or opposition with the AMO and further modulate EUC strength, oxidant demand and mixing. This possibility is evident in Fig.  5C  circa1990. Our annually resolved δ 15 N core records and historical data reanalyses show that the AMO exerts a greater influence on ocean oxygenation than previously recognised. Such forcing was also suggested for recent deoxygenation trends in the equatorial Atlantic 38 . There is growing evidence that both the Indian monsoon patterns and atmospheric and upper ocean circulation in the Pacific are ultimately linked to Atlantic SST variability 24 , 25 . The AMO triggers a worldwide gradient in temperature anomalies between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere with higher temperatures in the North during positive AMO phases as shown in recent studies 25 . Anomalously high temperature in the North Atlantic (AMO+) drive the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) Northward in both the Atlantic and the Pacific simultaneously 24 . This in turn has an all-encompassing effect on the tropical North Pacific atmospheric and surface ocean circulations. In summary, a change of AMO phase from negative to positive while the PDO phase changes from positive to negative from the 80s onwards (arrows Fig.  1 ) are accompanied by a weakening of the equatorial and subtropical subsurface circulation in the ETNP. The combined effect of these changes in atmospheric and subsurface ocean circulation is a decrease in oxygen supply to the ETNP OMZ in the eastern tropical Pacific. These results, together with recent studies on the region under the influence of the Indian monsoon, which hosts another major OMZ 25  point to a global control on marine oxygen at multidecadal timescales originating in the North Atlantic (Fig.  1 ). Naidu et al. found that Indian summer monsoon rainfall variability is modulated by the AMO which causes changes in the heat contrast between the Indian Ocean and the Asian land mass, leading to large-scale atmospheric variability above the tropical ocean and continent. This study 25  demonstrates that the AMO+ leads to increased precipitation over the Asian Continent and subsequent changes in the regional Hadley circulation, as well as enhanced easterly trade winds across the northern equatorial Pacific (and hence, the equatorial upwelling) and Walker cell north of the equator. This is consistent with the results produced by our data reanalyses (Fig.  5 ) and points to the AMO as a global forcing on Northern Hemisphere climate and ocean (sub)surface circulation via atmospheric teleconnection and ocean–atmosphere feedback mechanisms. The causal relationship between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the AMO (surface temperature anomalies) is still being debated 39 . However, irrespective of the nature of the relationship between the AMO and AMOC, evidence linking the AMO/AMOC and deoxygenation in the ETNP is illustrated in the 150 year-long denitrification records in the ETNP reconstructed and published by Deutsch et al. 34  in Fig.  7 . These records display a sharp decrease in denitrification (oxygen depletion) during the 70s to 90s in Californian Basins, when the AMO is strongly negative (Fig.  5 ) and various markers of North Atlantic upper ocean circulation show marked slackening of the AMOC (summarised by Caesar et al. 40 , Fig.  7A ) at a time when the EUC strength peaks (reversed  Y  axis). Beside this period of marked changes between 1970 and 1995/2000 in both North Atlantic and Equatorial Pacific upper circulation intensity, the entire 100 year period prior to 1970 shows similar overall decreasing trends in δ 15 N and AMOC index while the EUC velocity steadily increases, indicating a stable link between North Atlantic climate and Pacific deoxygenation via the couple ocean–atmosphere mechanisms revealed by our study: namely, changes in the Hadley circulation in the tropical Pacific impacting the EUC velocity and oxygen supply to the eastern tropical Pacific subsurface. Thus, we suggest future changes in ocean oxygenation might have intimate links with multidecadal variability in the strength of the AMOC and changes in temperature patterns in the North Atlantic 27 . Fig. 7 Long-term oxygenation and circulation changes. Reconstruction of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) index 40  since 1880 ( A ) compared with denitrification trends in the Gulf of California (GoC) Pescadero Basin ( B ) and outside the GoC in Santa Monica Basin ( C ) 34  representing changes in oxygenation in the ETNP. Changes in the Equatorial Under Current (EUC) maximum velocity calculated as in Fig.  5  for the period 1880–2012 ( D ). Both AMO+ and PDO− cause Northen Hemisphere warming as well as stratification and warming of the North Pacific (Fig.  4A, B ). Previous studies have used this mechanism to explain the influence of PDO− on oxygen in the ETNP 7 , 8 . Our study shows the preponderant impact of AMO+ in the Pacific, which not only causes North Pacific warming but also decreases tropical oxygen supply. Current global changes cause temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and Noth Atlantic to rise and the trade winds over the tropical Pacific to intensify 41 . This has been linked to increases in the positive AMO index and baseline over the last 150 years 42 . Naidu et al. argue that the additive effect of AMO and global change together can amplify Northern Hemisphere warming and enhance monsoon winds and rainfall 25 . It can also lead to lower oxygen in the Northern Indian Ocean through monsoon-driven upwelling winds, productivity and oxygen consumption. Therefore, we hypothesise that oxygen levels will continue to decrease in the region, and potentially in other basins, due to the additive effects of climate oscillations and global warming. In particular, one can expect particularly severe episodes of Pacific deoxygenation in the future when AMO+ and PDO− phases concur with global warming, with drastic impacts on ocean ecology and biogeochemistry 43 , such as we have seen in the last 2 decades (Fig.  1 )."

84,materials|methods,"Methods Models and experiments We analyse the AMOC upwelling pathways in 34 CMIP6 models (Extended Data Table  1 ) from the pre-industrial control (piControl) simulation 51  and their responses under two extreme-forcing scenarios: the ‘abrupt-4xCO2’ experiment 51  (‘4xCO2’ herein) and the ‘u03_hos’ experiment from the North Atlantic Hosing Model Intercomparison Project 19  (NAHosMIP). In 4xCO2, atmospheric CO 2  concentrations are instantaneously quadrupled from piControl levels and maintained for 150 years. In u03_hos, a uniform freshwater forcing of 0.3 Sv is applied to the North Atlantic between 50° N and the Bering Strait for at least 100 years. We examine seven CMIP6 models in u03_hos. We use a single ensemble member from each run (Extended Data Table  1 ). All available models are included in our analysis to ensure a wide range in the AMOC’s upwelling pathways, enabling robust relationships to be inferred. Variables We analyse the monthly mean overturning mass streamfunction, including both Eulerian mean and parameterized eddy components 34 , in depth space (variables, ‘msftmz’ or ‘msftyz’) and in density space (variables, ‘msftmrho’ or ‘msftyrho’), in six models that provide this variable or in which we calculate it. We average the overturning streamfunction over the first 50 years of the piControl simulation, and over the 20-year period centred on 90 years into the 4xCO2 and u03_hos experiments to obtain the ‘future’ state. We focus on the period 90 years in the extreme-forcing experiments because it is available in all models and because the AMOC has generally stabilized. We calculate the AMOC strength (where AMOC is defined as the Atlantic Ocean mid-depth overturning cell) from the maximum Atlantic streamfunction value north of the Equator and below 500 m depth. We calculate the PMOC strength from the maximum Indo-Pacific streamfunction value at 34.5° S, between 500 m and 4,000 m depth, to exclude wind-driven gyres and unrelated deep overturning circulations. Although weak PMOC cells are present in the control experiment of a few models (Fig.  3a,c ), they are confined to the deep ocean and thus do not affect the magnitude of the AMOC’s upwelling pathways. In density space, the AMOC and PMOC strengths are defined similarly to those in depth space, but at a neutral density greater than 1,026 kg m −3  in the HadGEM3 models and at a density referenced to 2,000 m greater than 1,035 kg m −3  in 4 other models analysed (Extended Data Fig.  4 ). Calculating the AMOC’s upwelling pathways Upwelling pathway definitions We apply the method of ref.  3 , adapted from ref.  37 , to calculate the AMOC’s upwelling pathways (Fig.  1a ). These pathways quantify the time-mean area-integrated volume transports that return deep waters from the AMOC’s southwards branch to its shallower northwards branch (Fig.  1c ). We define the AMOC strength as its maximum strength below 500 m depth in the North Atlantic (Fig.  1a , purple circle). The upwelling pathways—Atlantic (‘Atlantic_Up’), Indo-Pacific residual (‘IndoPac_ResidualUp’) and SO (‘SouthernOcean_Up’)—define the regions where AMOC origin waters upwell before rejoining the northwards branch of the AMOC. Each upwelling pathway is greater than or equal to zero and collectively match the AMOC strength (equation ( 4 ) and Fig.  1 ) as the global overturning circulation conserves volume. We determine the three upwelling pathways by analysing the zonally integrated meridional overturning streamfunction in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans, and a globally integrated streamfunction in the SO, defined as latitudes south of 34.5° S (Fig.  1 ). These have units of sverdrups (10 6  m 3  s −1 ). The Atlantic upwelling pathway (Atlantic_Up, blue box) corresponds to the upwelling rate of AMOC deep waters in the Atlantic Ocean that return northwards nearer the surface, inferred from the closed streamlines of the AMOC (Fig.  1a ). The SO upwelling pathway (SouthernOcean_Up, orange box) quantifies total upwelling of North Atlantic (that is, AMOC) origin waters by the SO upper cell, including those that first upwell in the Indo-Pacific (Fig.  1 ). The Indo-Pacific residual upwelling pathway (IndoPac_ResidualUp, green box in Fig.  1b ) quantifies the AMOC’s upwelling pathway in the Indo-Pacific Ocean that does not later upwell in the SO (the latter is accounted for by SouthernOcean_Up). Upwelling of AMOC origin waters in the South Indo-Pacific Ocean subtropical gyre cells that first upwell in the SO (most notable in CESM2-based models) are also accounted for by SouthernOcean_Up, not IndoPac_ResidualUp. We calculate the Indo-Pacific residual upwelling pathway as a residual using equation ( 4 ), which ensures volume conservation in the ocean. In ref.  3 , we showed that in a transient state, changes in AMOC strength are balanced by changes in the AMOC’s upwelling pathways, and vice versa. These changes are communicated rapidly by non-advective wave processes 31 , ensuring a global upwelling–downwelling balance to conserve volume. Thus, on a decadal or longer timescale, the time-mean AMOC upwelling pathways are equal to the time-mean AMOC strength (Fig.  2 ). Changes in the meridional overturning circulation remote from, but connected to, the North Atlantic through the overturning streamfunction therefore modulate the AMOC strength, even if the AMOC weakening is instigated by changes in North Atlantic forcing. Equations The equations used to calculate the upwelling pathways (equations ( 1 )–( 4 )) are: 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

South Atlantic and Indo-Pacific overturning cells In some models, a weak, localized South Atlantic circulation at 34.5° S, isolated from the North Atlantic, upwells in the SO (Extended Data Fig.  10 ). This circulation, denoted ‘South_Atlantic_local’ (equation ( 2 ) and Extended Data Fig.  10 ), is accounted for when calculating both the Atlantic upwelling pathway (equation ( 1 )) and the SO upwelling pathway (equation ( 3 )) as it reduces SO upwelling (that is, the globally integrated SO upper cell strength at 34.5° S,  ψ max ∣ ϕ  = 34.5°S  (red circle in Fig.  1a )) available for upwelling AMOC deep waters. ‘South_Atlantic_local’, determined from equation ( 2 ), is reduced if a component of the localized South Atlantic waters enters an anticlockwise overturning cell in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, upwells and rejoins the northwards branch of the localized South Atlantic circulation. This is because these waters do not upwell in the SO and thus do not reduce SouthernOcean_Up. Under extreme forcing, most models develop a PMOC that upwells in the SO, further reducing the amount of SO upwelling available to upwell AMOC deep waters. We therefore modify the method of ref.  3  to account for the presence of a PMOC. A latitudinally expansive PMOC at the depth of the AMOC maximum at 34.5° S, z_AMOC_34S, indicates that any AMOC waters that enter and upwell in the Indo-Pacific Ocean must later upwell in the SO to rejoin the AMOC’s northwards branch, as they cannot bypass the PMOC. This scenario occurs in the future state of all models with a PMOC (Extended Data Figs.  2  and  3 ), ensuring that IndoPac_ResidualUp is zero (Fig.  2d,h ). If SouthernOcean_Up, calculated from the first expression on the right-hand side of equation ( 3 ), exceeds the AMOC transport into the SO (AMOC min ; grey circle in Extended Data Fig.  10 ), we adjust SouthernOcean_Up to match AMOC min  (second expression on the right-hand side of equation ( 3 )). This ensures that the AMOC’s SO upwelling pathway is not stronger than the AMOC transport into the SO, as required by conservation of volume. We therefore implicitly account for the impact of the PMOC on the AMOC’s SO upwelling pathway in this case, based on conservation of volume. We account for the PMOC implicitly rather than explicitly to prevent inaccuracies in the upwelling pathways that would otherwise occur in the following scenarios. If the PMOC maximum is below z_AMOC_34S, then AMOC deep waters can enter the PMOC’s northwards branch before upwelling in the SO (most notable in CESM2-based models). If a localized clockwise overturning cell at 34.5° S is present in the upper Pacific Ocean (found in the control state of a few models; for example, Extended Data Fig.  1f,g ), then SO upper cell waters enter the northwards near-surface branch of these Pacific cells, sink and later enter the AMOC’s northwards branch via SO zonal transports. In these scenarios, not all the southwards PMOC transport at 34.5° S reduces the AMOC’s SO upwelling pathway (SouthernOcean_Up), so explicitly accounting for the maximum PMOC strength at 34.5° S would underestimate this upwelling pathway. We therefore only explicitly account for upwelling of PMOC deep waters in the SO if they cannot be connected to the AMOC (first expression on the right-hand side of equation ( 3 )), unlike in the scenarios above. Thus, we subtract the PMOC strength at the depth of the maximum AMOC strength at 34.5° S, z_AMOC_34S, from  ψ max ∣ ϕ  = 34.5°S  when calculating SouthernOcean_Up (equation ( 3 )). Hence, if the PMOC maximum is shallower (deeper) than z_AMOC_34S, we subtract the magnitude of the southwards (northwards) PMOC transport below (above) z_AMOC_34S to calculate SouthernOcean_Up. This results in a small decrease in SouthernOcean_Up during the initial 30 years of the forcing experiments relative to not explicitly accounting for these PMOC transports. Our approach is validated by IndoPac_ResidualUp tending rapidly (over several decades) towards zero (Fig.  2d,h ) before we constrain it to zero by setting SouthernOcean_Up to AMOC min  (second expression on the right-hand side of equation ( 3 )). The PMOC rapidly expands, preventing upwelling above the PMOC’s base. Therefore, IndoPac_ResidualUp quickly tends to zero when a PMOC forms. Our approach is further validated by the strong correlation between the inverse future PMOC strength and the change in the AMOC’s SO upwelling pathway (Fig.  4a,c ), despite our approach not explicitly accounting for the PMOC in the future-state calculations (when SouthernOcean_Up is set to AMOC min ). The outlying CESM2-based models in Fig.  4c,f  and Fig.  5b,d  (purple shading) emphasize the importance of implicitly accounting for the PMOC in the future state to prevent inaccuracies in the magnitude of SouthernOcean_Up (see scenario 1 above). We further validated our method by examining the overturning streamfunctions across models and experiments for inconsistencies with their calculated upwelling pathways. Southern Ocean buoyancy fluxes Following ref.  52 , we calculate the surface buoyancy flux,  B , across 16 CMIP6 models using equation ( 5 ): 5 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The net surface heat and freshwater flux variables (‘hfds’ and ‘wfo’, respectively) include contributions from sea-ice fluxes. We separate the heat and freshwater fluxes into their components—the net longwave and shortwave radiation (‘rls’ and ‘rss’), latent and sensible heat fluxes (‘hfls’ and ‘hfss’), precipitation and evaporation fluxes (‘pr’ and ‘evspsbl’), and sea-ice freshwater fluxes that are calculated as a residual. We calculate the multi-model mean components from a subset of nine models that provide all these variables (Extended Data Fig.  7b ). We find that using a time-varying thermal expansion coefficient causes large shifts in the changes in the heat flux components, but these shifts mostly compensate each other, resulting in only minor differences in the net surface heat and buoyancy flux changes (a slight reduction in the maximum positive changes). Therefore, we show changes in the heat flux components using the thermal expansion coefficient from the control simulation (Extended Data Fig.  7b ) to accurately determine the cause of the net buoyancy flux changes.

88,introduction,"INTRODUCTION The risk of climate tipping points (TPs) due to increasing greenhouse warming has become an integral part of the scientific outreach about climate change to the general public. Nevertheless, they are usually assessed as low probability scenarios in commonly assumed pathways of future climate change ( 1 ). The actual existence and anatomy of truly abrupt, singular TPs in real-world systems remains uncertain. Most state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) have difficulties simulating TP behavior, such as observed in the past climate record, perhaps due to stability biases ( 2 ,  3 ). Their full stability landscape, i.e., the collection of changing equilibrium states as a function of boundary conditions (determined by atmospheric greenhouse gases), is computationally too expensive to assess at present. Thus, TP research most often combines climate feedback assessments in observations and short ESM simulations with simpler, conceptual mathematical models, which in turn are used to interpret complex datasets. These models describe the state of a so-called tipping element (TE), which is a large-scale climate subsystem that is believed to have a TP due to a dominant positive feedback. In the presence of nonlinear feedbacks the conceptual models can display bistability, where in addition to a desired, present-day stable state (attractor), a second, undesired stable state exists for given boundary conditions. An important milestone in the development of this paradigm was due to Stommel ( 4 ), who proposed bistability and the existence of a reversed or collapsed circulation in a conceptual model of the AMOC. Another was the discovery by Budyko ( 5 ) and Sellers ( 6 ) of the existence—then confirmed by observational evidence ( 7 )—of a snowball state that coexists with the warm state for given astronomical and astrophysical features of the Earth. Since then, many parts of the Earth system have been proposed to display bistability between a present-day and a coexisting undesired state. This includes a savannah state of present-day rainforests and an ice-free state of the present-day ice sheets ( 8 ). For the conceptual models of any such TE, the present-day state changes only sightly at first as the boundary conditions gradually deteriorate. But eventually a TP is reached where the present-day state loses stability, and the system is forced to undergo a transition to the undesired state as the only remaining stable solution. Before the TP, such conceptual models predict the existence of so-called early-warning signals (EWS), which are changes in the fluctuations of observables describing the TE state ( 9 – 12 ). Consistent with this conceptual paradigm, a considerable number of large-scale climate subsystems have been proposed to irreversibly and abruptly shift to an undesired state if the boundary conditions change sufficiently. At the same time, when staying below the purported TP, no qualitative changes of the TE state are expected. Many TEs have already been suggested to approach a TP, based on the analysis of EWS in historic and modern observations ( 13 – 18 ). Conceptual models of TEs are without a doubt invaluable tools to understand complex real-world datasets and systems. Nevertheless, because of their coarse-grained nature, it is clear that they cannot describe the Earth system dynamics in full detail, and thus, many researchers expect the dynamics and stability properties to be inevitably more complex. This suspected complexity is, however, difficult to show explicitly due to the high dimensionality and computational cost of climate models. In the following, we list some mechanisms by which the stability landscape of a TE in the coupled climate system may become more complicated than typical conceptual models capture, and by which an eventual system collapse may not be a singular event that can be universally anticipated. In reality, it may not always be warranted to model a TE in isolation, as its state may be substantially influenced by the state of another climate subsystem. If containing a positive feedback sensitive to the same control parameter, then this other system may itself be a TE and display multiple stable states (multistability) and the possibility to tip. For instance, a bistable AMOC may interact with a bistable subpolar gyre ( 19 ). When tipping in one of the systems occurs before the tipping of the second system, the coupling leads to a qualitative but potentially only subtle change in the state of the second TE. A model of the coupled system shows multistability beyond the bistability of the individual TEs. Coupling of several TEs has been considered in conceptual models of so-called cascades of TPs ( 20 – 26 ). However, although there are examples of spontaneous or forced sequential regime shifts ( 27 – 29 ), this phenomenon has not been investigated systematically in high-dimensional ESMs. Also, in cases where a TE is not influenced substantially by other climate subsystems on the timescales of interest, simple bistable conceptual models may be insufficient to describe the dynamics. First, individual TEs can be subject to more than one positive feedback due to different physical processes that influence the stability of the system. For instance, the positive salt-advection feedback of the AMOC may be complemented by localized positive convective feedbacks ( 30 ). Second, even the action of only one dominant positive feedback on multiple weakly coupled domains in spatially extended, heterogeneous systems may lead to more complicated, spatially fragmented tipping ( 31 – 34 ). This aspect is not easily captured in conceptual models but has been shown in studies of large-scale geophysical flows, which suggest the existence of multiple spatial patterns of convection that lead to different stable regimes of the AMOC ( 35 – 41 ). Multistability beyond two coexisting states was also reported for snowball Earth transitions in intermediate-complexity ESMs ( 42 ,  43 ) and was proposed to reflect the multiscale nature of the underlying quasipotential of the climate ( 44 ). Last, already relatively simple nonlinear systems may intrinsically feature rich dynamics and much more pronounced multistability compared to the bistable dynamics of the usual TP paradigm ( 45 – 50 ). Here, we present a detailed investigation of the anatomy of a prominent TP, the collapse of the AMOC due to increasing glacial melt. This is done by careful construction of the stability landscape in a global ocean model, which exhibits many of the above aspects, such as spatial heterogeneity, high dimensionality, as well as a multitude of physical processes and scales. We investigate an ocean-only model with constant coupling to an atmospheric climatology. Such a choice enables us to simulate the model long enough to separate close-by but disconnected attractors, and it avoids the effectively stochastic atmosphere to mask the fine structure of the multistability in the ocean dynamics. In the real world, we expect that at some level, close-by attractors can merge by atmospheric noise-induced transitions in the timescales of interest. Further, ocean-atmosphere feedbacks could in principle enhance or diminish the multistability present in the ocean-only dynamics. Using subtle changes in freshwater forcing, we find an abundance of abrupt qualitative AMOC changes that stem from a variety of multistable regimes with up to nine coexisting alternative attractors. Just like the TP associated with the collapse, the abrupt changes occur as one branch of attractors loses stability and the system undergoes a transition to another branch. For this phenomenon, we use the term intermediate tipping points (ITP), since the changes occur before the AMOC collapse and because the attractor branches are often confined to narrow parameter ranges. Unlike a full AMOC collapse, ITPs comprise only small changes in mean AMOC strength, but they can often be associated with specific changes in the spatiotemporal variability of the ocean circulation. Occurring well before the eventual collapse, they complicate the task of predicting a collapse from observational time series. We furthermore highlight that the complex landscape of coexisting basins of attraction permits rate-induced transitions, whereby the realized path to the AMOC collapse can be sensitive to initial conditions and the forcing variations."
89,results,"RESULTS Hysteresis and intermediate TPs We start our analysis of the AMOC tipping by a hysteresis experiment, where the North Atlantic (NA) freshwater input is increased quasi-adiabatically at a rate of 1.5 · 10 −5  Sv/year until AMOC collapse and subsequently decreased again (Materials and Methods).  Figure 1A  shows the AMOC strength as a function of simulation time and freshwater forcing. Here and in the remainder of the paper, the AMOC strength is defined as the maximum value of the overturning streamfunction in the NA below 500 m depth. A relatively narrow region of hysteresis is found (shaded area), where a collapsed AMOC state seems to coexist with a weakened but still active circulation state with northern downwelling. The eventual collapse is not abrupt but comprises three steps (inset in  Fig. 1A ) where the AMOC decrease temporarily slows down. Fig. 1. Intermediate TPs before a freshwater-induced collapse of the overturning circulation. ( A ) Maximum strength of the Atlantic Meriodional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as a function of the freshwater forcing during a hysteresis experiment (Materials and Methods). The black (gray) crosses are 50-year averages obtained after each forcing increment during the increasing (decreasing) part of the hysteresis experiment. In blue, we show the actual trajectory in 5-year averages during the increasing parameter sweep. At the red crosses, we start equilibrium simulations with fixed forcing, which form the basis for the construction of the stability landscape (Materials and Methods). The inset is a close-up of the collapsing trajectory, which seems to consist of three steps. ( B  to  E ) Close-ups of the trajectory in 1-year averages showing discontinuous changes in mean and variability of the AMOC strength, as a response to the gradual change in forcing. The trajectory (blue) in  Fig. 1A  shows additional subtle but discrete changes in the mean and variability. At moderate forcing, we see approximate quasi-periodic dynamics with a decadal-scale oscillation of close to 20 years. The spatiotemporal pattern of these oscillations is consistent with westward propagating Rossby waves in the NA (fig. S1), which were previously invoked as mechanism for multidecadal Atlantic variability ( 51 – 54 ). Mean and amplitude of the oscillations, as well as the relative strength of its periodic components, change abruptly in ITPs at several parameter values [e.g.,  Fig. 1 (B and C)  and see fig. S2 for a wavelet analysis]. At larger forcing, almost periodic oscillations with a period of roughly 11 years suddenly appear ( Fig. 1D ), which then abruptly die off leaving essentially chaotic low-amplitude variability with no dominant periodicities (see  Fig. 1E  and spectra in fig. S3). Stability landscape The question arises whether the ITPs are abrupt changes in a single attractor of the system (so-called interior crisis of the attractor), or whether they reflect loss of stability of one attractor and a transitions to another (so-called boundary crisis of the attractor) ( 55 ). Further, given that the overall collapse is gradual, it is not obvious whether the observed hysteresis is merely a transient. By performing equilibrium simulations that are branched off from the hysteresis simulation at various parameter values (red crosses in  Fig. 1A , time series in fig. S4), we confirm that the hysteresis indeed reflects a coexistence of a vigorous and a collapsed AMOC state. The vigorous states in the hysteresis loop feature an already substantially weakened AMOC, but the overturning cell still spans from the polar NA down to the Southern Ocean ( Fig. 2, A and B ). In addition, a partially collapsed stable state with a further weakened AMOC exists, which is visited during the step-wise AMOC collapse of the hysteresis simulations. In this regime, there is a residual AMOC transport across the equator, but the overturning cell does not extend to the Southern Ocean ( Fig. 2C ). The maximum overturning strength in the NA is less than 7 Sv. In contrast, the collapsed states feature no equatorial transport by the AMOC ( Fig. 2D ), and its maximum strength in the NA is less than 3 Sv. Fig. 2. Overturning streamfunctions of different circulation regimes. Meridional overturning streamfunctions obtained from 100-year averages of the velocity fields in the Atlantic for equilibrium simulations that were started from the hysteresis simulation at the points marked by roman numerals in  Fig. 1A . Shown are states corresponding to a vigorous overturning circulation for moderate freshwater forcing ( A ), the vigorous regime close to the collapse ( B ), a partially collapsed state ( C ), and a collapsed state ( D ). Note the different color bar scale for panel (A). There are indeed qualitative differences in the states obtained before and after the ITPs, as well as for the states found from the increasing and decreasing parameter sweep at the same forcing values (fig. S4). This shows that the ITPs are not transient and that actual multistability exist. To reveal the extent of the multistability regimes, we perform a continuation along the control parameter, using very small increments of the freshwater forcing and subsequent equilibration of the model. The continuation experiments comprise 280 simulations with an average duration of 7005 years. Additional branches are found by large ensembles of simulations from independent initial conditions (Materials and Methods), yielding a total of 2.75 million simulation years. A bifurcation diagram showing all determined branches of stable states is given in  Fig. 3 (A and B) . For diagrams with other observables, see fig. S5. In total, instead of just one pair of branches of states, corresponding to a vigorous and a collapsed AMOC, and two associated TPs, we identify 26 branches of attractors, as well as roughly 50 crises where an attractor loses stability. There are up to nine coexisting attractors for a fixed value of the freshwater forcing. Both the vigorous and collapsed regimes feature a number of coexisting attractors with only slightly differing mean AMOC strength. Fig. 3.

Symbols with the same color and shape correspond to the individual equilibrium simulations that represent one branch of stable AMOC states (thick gray lines). Coexisting branches have been reached from different initial conditions (Materials and Methods).

Hypothetical unstable states lying between attractors are shown as black dashed lines. ( C ) Ensemble of  N  = 89 simulations (gray) with perturbed initial conditions (Materials and Methods) that converge onto the different attractors (colored time series). ( D  to  G ) Long time series of the equilibrium simulations for all coexisting attractors at four values of the forcing parameter. The color coding corresponds to the branches in (A). Figure 3C  shows an ensemble of simulations with different initial conditions converging to the distinct states (see fig. S6 for ensembles at other parameter values). Time series of coexisting states at a selection of slices across the bifurcation diagram show that there are no trends in the AMOC strength and that each state appears stationary ( Fig. 3, D to G ). States of similar mean AMOC strength can differ substantially in their temporal variability (e.g.,  Fig. 3D ), and some states feature rare, temporary excursions to lower values of the AMOC strength with multimillennial recurrence times (e.g., red time series in  Fig. 3E ). The ITPs are caused by the loss of stability of one attractor and the subsequent transition to another attractor of different AMOC mean or variability or both. One possible exception occurs at  F  = 0.283 Sv, where the ITP rather seems to reflect an interior crisis of the attractor (fig. S7). The multistable cluster around  F  = 0.30 Sv to  F  = 0.32 Sv, before the onset of the main hysteresis loop, causes the most clearly visible sequence of ITPs ( Fig. 1, C and D ). The edges of the main hysteresis loop are lined with short intervals of partially collapsed AMOC states. They coexist with the vigorous or collapsed states and form smaller-scale hysteresis loops with notable resemblance to the main hysteresis loop (see inset of  Fig. 3A ). As in the main loop, both upper and lower regimes of the smaller-scale loop comprise a cluster of multiple close-by attractors, which differ by only 0.1 to 0.2 Sv in AMOC strength. This suggests a hierarchical organization of the stability landscape, where clusters of attractors may appear at progressively smaller scales of the observable and the control parameter. Spatiotemporal modes and heterogeneity The AMOC strength is tightly linked to the convective activity in different regions of the NA ocean. Since the bathymetry and atmospheric forcing are zonally asymmetric, transitions between convective and nonconvective conditions might occur independently and at different values of the control parameter at the distinct NA locations. As the freshwater forcing is increased, both the Labrador Sea and the Nordic Sea convective activity gradually weaken, as illustrated by the mean winter mixed layer depth (MLD) for a sequence of equilibrium simulations that comprise the states traversed during the transient AMOC collapse ( Fig. 4 ). As the partially collapsed AMOC state is reached, it appears that the Labrador Sea convection ceases while the Nordic Sea convection is still active ( Fig. 4I ). Fig. 4. Change in spatial pattern of convection during the collapse of the overturning circulation. Maps of the 100-year average winter MLD in the NA for a series of 10 equilibrium simulations at increasingly larger freshwater forcing, given in the panel titles. MLD is defined by the depth until which the monthly average ocean temperature is within 0.5 K of the sea surface temperature, indicating the degree of vertical mixing via convection. The winter MLD is obtained by averaging over the first 4 months of the year. The color coding in the panel titles indicates the branches of attractors in  Fig. 3A . ( A  to  H ) Vigorous circulation states, whereas ( I ) is in the partially collapsed regime, and ( J ) is a collapsed overturning state. Overall, we find that some of the coexisting stable states, and thus some of the ITPs, can be associated with qualitative changes in the convective pattern, while others cannot. In the latter category are ITPs associated with coexisting vigorous AMOC states. Here, the pattern of mean winter MLD stays qualitatively the same, i.e., there are no larger NA regions with substantial convection in one state but not in the other. This is shown for the five coexisting stable states in  Fig. 5 (A to E) , where the extent of the convective activity in the Labrador and Nordic Seas is largely the same in all states. Nevertheless, there can be substantial quantitative differences in MLD patterns, which are spatially correlated and distributed over the entire NA ( Fig. 5, K to N ). In cases of coexisting pairs of states (vigorous or partially collapsed) that are very close in mean AMOC strength (difference of 0.1 to 0.2 Sv), we again find the same qualitative convective pattern but only relatively small quantitative differences in MLD (fig. S8). Also an entire cluster comprising both vigorous and partially collapsed states can show the same qualitative pattern in all states (fig. S9, A to F). On the other hand, there are a variety of coexisting states that indeed show qualitatively different patterns of mean MLD. Among these are the coexisting branches of collapsed AMOC states, which feature clearly distinct locations of residual NA convection (fig. S9, G to I), and some branches of partially collapsed states, which feature different patterns compared to coexisting, vigorous branches (fig. S10, A, B, D, and E). Fig. 5. Spatial pattern and variability of convection in a cluster of coexisting stable states. ( A  to  E ) Maps of the 100-year average MLD in the NA for the cluster of five coexisting vigorous circulation states at the same forcing value (corresponding to the states shown in  Fig. 3D ). ( F  to  J ) Temporal SD of the MLD in consecutive winters obtained from 100 years of simulation. ( K  to  N ) Difference in the 100-year mean MLD with respect to the state ON-1 of panel (A). ( O ) Short time series segments of the equilibrium simulations, highlighting the differences in overturning variability. The same color code is used as in (A) to (E) and in  Fig. 3 . The strength of vertical mixing in individual grid cells varies over time. The MLD shows considerable temporal variability that can be as large or larger than the differences in mean MLD between coexisting states ( Fig. 5, F to J ). Usually, the large-scale convective pattern, i.e., the collection of grid cells that show deep mixing each winter, stays stationary over time. But there are states where a handful of neighboring grid cells oscillate between convective and nonconvective winter conditions. For instance, the two coexisting states shown in  Fig. 5 (A and B)  show decadal oscillations in cells south of Greenland and in the Nordic Seas (figs. S11 and S12). Both states feature the exact same collection of cells that either participate in the oscillation or that are permanently convecting. As a result, the two states differ only in the period and amplitude of this oscillation and in the average mixing depth of cells. It is worth noting that the strength of NA MLD variability may not be directly reflected in the AMOC variability. The variability in MLD of states ON-1 and ON-2 ( Fig. 5, A and B ) is roughly the same, but state ON-2 features a much larger AMOC variability ( Fig. 5O ). Similarly, states ON-4 and ON-5 feature a similar AMOC variability, but state ON-5 has much lower MLD variability ( Fig. 5, I and J ). The AMOC variability in this cluster of states can also show different dominant frequencies (fig. S13). Coexisting states that are very close in mean AMOC strength (0.1 to 0.2 Sv) can differ substantially in their temporal AMOC variability and dominant periods (fig. S14) despite featuring near-identical convection patterns in the NA (fig. S8) and elsewhere. As a result, we cannot directly link all ITPs with qualitative and abrupt changes of the convective pattern. But from the above analysis, it is clear that due to the spatially distributed differences in MLD of the equilibrium states of different branches and due to the notable differences in AMOC variability and spectrum, at least some ITPs manifest themselves as abrupt reorganizations in the spatiotemporal pattern. To test whether the previous findings are robust or a spurious effect due to the chosen resolution, we performed simulations with a doubled horizontal grid resolution, which again show ITPs before the AMOC collapse (fig. S15). While a direct confirmation of multistability similar to the lower resolution case has not been attempted due to high computational cost, the results suggest that, also in the higher-resolution model, there are coexisting states with subtly different AMOC strength but qualitatively different variability. Branching off multimillennial equilibrium simulations before and after ITPs reveals spatially distributed changes in MLD (fig. S16) and shows that at least one ITP can be associated with a qualitative change in the convective pattern [cessation of Nordic Sea convection in fig. S16 (B and D)]. For both model resolutions, it appears that some but not all coexisting states are associated with different spatial convection patterns. We next test more explicitly whether the ITPs are due to asymmetric boundary conditions and bathymetry in the NA. To this end, we perform simulations with three alternative model configurations where the NA bathymetry and different boundary conditions are made zonally symmetric (see Materials and Methods and fig. S17). These all feature ITPs as in the fully heterogeneous case (fig. S18). The circulation and convective activity remain zonally asymmetric, and some ITPs (but not all) can be associated with qualitative changes in the convective pattern (fig. S18), where the main convective region quickly expands or migrates east-/westwards. The presence of ITPs and the underlying multistability thus seems not a consequence of heterogeneity in NA bathymetry and boundary conditions. Using more idealized, zonally symmetric model topography, future studies should investigate how heterogeneity outside of the NA, such as in the Southern Ocean, influences AMOC multistability. Transient dynamics We now investigate in more detail how the transient dynamics during a linear parameter shift with nonnegligible rate of change relate to the underlying stability landscape in the reference model setup. After initialization with a 10 ka equilibrium simulation at  F  = 0.184 Sv, we perform an ensemble of experiments where the freshwater forcing is ramped linearly from  F  = 0.184 Sv to  F  = 0.407 Sv at different rates of change (fig. S19).  Figure 6 (A to C)  shows three trajectories at increasing ramping speeds plotted on top of the bifurcation diagram of  Fig. 3A . We see that faster ramping leads to a weaker AMOC at a given parameter value. This may appear counterintuitive: Since the equilibrium AMOC strength decreases with increasing freshwater forcing, one might expect the faster ramping trajectories to show a stronger instantaneous AMOC (lagging behind), thus with the trajectory curve above the equilibrium curve and not below as observed.

( A  to  C ) Transient simulations (black trajectories) with a linear forcing increase at different rates (A) 0.007 Sv/ka, (B) 0.037 ka, and (C) 0.074 Sv/ka, superimposed on the upper portion of the bifurcation diagram of  Fig. 3 . The colored symbols are the branches of attractors that are visited by all transient trajectories, as has been determined by stopping the parameter shifts at several values. Other branches of attractors are given in gray or omitted. Note, however, that for  F  > 0.3 Sv, the basins of attractions of additional branches may be visited temporarily, depending on the rate (fig. S20). Dashed vertical lines indicate the forcing values at which the two most prominent intermediate ITP occur. The thick red (blue) vertical line indicates the forcing value where the red (light green) branch loses stability. The green vertical line indicates the lowest forcing value where the light green branch exists. ( D ) Forcing values where the two prominent ITPs [marked in (A) to (C)] occur, as a function of the forcing rate of change during the linear parameter shift. There is a similar sequence of ITPs for all but the fastest parameter shifts, where the time-dependent driving is very strong and the system is furthest away from its steady state properties (fig. S19). However, depending on the forcing rate, the AMOC variability after some ITPs is qualitatively different ( Fig. 6, A to C , and fig. S20). Further, the ITPs occur at different forcing values. This is easily seen in  Fig. 6 (A to C) , where we marked the onset of the two sharpest ITPs (red and blue dashed lines). The parameter values where these occur are shown in  Fig. 6D  as a function of the rate. The value increases monotonically with decreasing forcing rate and slowly approaches the approximate critical value found in the equilibrium analysis (shaded bands in  Fig. 6D ). Such tipping before the critical value that depends on the rate of change of the control parameter is referred to as rate-induced tipping ( 56 ). Here, a slow rate of change below a critical rate does not lead to a tipping before the bifurcation point. This means that the curves in  Fig. 6D  should collapse onto the shaded bands for values smaller than the critical rate. In our simulation, we cannot identify a critical rate, and it seems that the ITPs always occur before the critical value, also for very small rates of change where the corresponding state at higher AMOC strength is stable, and the tipping is not a transient effect (fig. S21). It may be that a critical value exists at even smaller rates, which we cannot test due to the computational constraints. Alternatively, this may be rate-induced tipping without a critical rate, as observed in simpler models of the AMOC ( 26 ,  57 ). In ( 26 ), this was due to a nonsmooth fold, whereby the basin boundary quickly comes very close to the moving attractor as the bifurcation is approached. This makes it impossible for the system to track the moving attractor, even for very small rates of change. In our multistable ocean model, a similar situation may arise when multiple basins of attraction are tightly folded. An additional transient effect is apparent from our simulations. For all but the slowest ramping speeds, the tipping to a state with stronger AMOC actually appears at a parameter value lower than the value where the corresponding branch of stable states begins to exist. For the branch associated with the first ITP, this value is shown by the green line in  Fig. 6 (A and D) . Either an additional coexisting attractor at higher AMOC strength has been missed, or the tipping is only transient. To investigate this, we start equilibrium simulations from the transient runs at a fixed forcing value, at which the simulations with fast ramping have already displayed an abrupt AMOC strengthening, but the slower ones have not (dotted line in  Fig. 6D ). At first, the faster simulations seem to converge to a stronger AMOC state ( Fig. 7A  and fig. S22). But eventually there is an abrupt transition back to a weaker AMOC state, which is identical to the one observed after slower ramping ( Fig. 7B ) and in the equilibrium analysis (gray trajectory). The trajectory with the fastest ramping shows an additional transient regime ( Fig. 7C ). This transient tipping could be understood as rate-induced tipping in an excitable system ( 58 ). Since in our case there is also an underlying multistability, we speculate that it could also be related to the attraction by the stable manifold of a saddle or to a ghost of the nearby branch of attractors ( 59 ). This remains difficult to test in a model of this complexity. Similar attractions to saddles are known in rate-induced tipping as maximum canard trajectories ( 60 ), but these are normally only expected for a narrow range of rates of change close to the critical rate. Fig. 7. Transient tipping for moderately fast changes in freshwater forcing. ( A  to  C ) Time series of simulations branched off at constant forcing value  F  = 0.296 Sv (dashed line in  Fig. 6D ) from the ensemble of linear ramping experiments (see the main text). The simulations are branched off from ensemble members with ramping rates from (A) 0.037 to 0.111 Sv/ka, (B) 0.022 to 0.032 Sv/ka, and (C) 0.223 Sv/ka. The gray trajectory is the equilibrium simulation at the corresponding forcing value (red branch in  Fig. 3 ). ( D ) Two constant-forcing simulations at  F  = 0.307 Sv branched off from the linear ramping experiments, where this forcing value was reached with the different forcing rates of 0.055 Sv/ka (black) and 0.037 Sv/ka (red). When instead starting constant-forcing simulations at a larger parameter value in the multistable regime, where some ensemble members have exhibited the second ITP discussed in  Fig. 6 , we find convergence to different attractors ( Fig. 7D  and fig. S23). Thus, different regions in phase space corresponding to different basins of attraction are visited, depending on the rate of parameter change during the traverse of the multistable regime. This leads to the rate-dependent differences in variability before the AMOC collapse discussed above. Early-warning signals One avenue for predicting an AMOC collapse is to use simulations with an ESM of high complexity to directly estimate the levels of freshwater forcing, global warming, or greenhouse gas concentrations at which a collapse occurs. Because of lack of processes and scales, the model used in our study is arguably not detailed enough for this task. The freshwater forcing at which the AMOC collapse occurs, as well as the number of ITPs observed before the collapse, depend sensitively on the model details. In a slightly changed model setup, where the relaxation time of the surface salinity to the forcing climatology is 5 instead of 2 years, we again see sharp ITPs but in a sequence that is qualitatively different to what is obtained with 2-year relaxation timescale (fig. S24). Another avenue for TP prediction is to observe generic EWS from time series as an indication that a TP is near. Our model is suitable for testing the applicability of such EWS for an AMOC collapse in a high-dimensional model system and in the presence of ITPs. EWS might be observable before each ITP, since each corresponds to a loss of stability of an attractor. But because of the a priori unknown number of ITPs before the AMOC collapse, it may not be possible to distinguish EWS before an arbitrary ITP from EWS before the AMOC collapse. EWS only measures changes in the local properties of the underlying dynamical system and thus cannot tell whether the impending qualitative shift is a complete collapse or just a minor reorganization of the spatiotemporal climate pattern. A difficulty of actually observing EWS before any ITP is evident from the simulations with transient freshwater increase presented in the previous section. Because of rate-induced tipping, the ITPs do not necessarily occur at the parameter values where the corresponding attractors lose stability. In this case, prediction via critical slowing down is not possible in general ( 26 ). As an additional limitation to predictability, the critical rate beyond which a rate-induced tipping occurs can be fuzzy in chaotic systems ( 61 ,  62 ). It is unknown how prevalent rate-dependent tipping is in multistable systems. But it seems plausible that the larger the number of coexisting and potentially folded basins of attraction, the harder it may be for a trajectory to stay exclusively in its current basin under a parameter shift, which is a condition for the nonexistence of rate-induced tipping. Assuming EWS are consistently observed before ITPs, a continuous monitoring of the system during increasing freshwater forcing would lead to a jumpy behavior of EWS indicators, which repeatedly increase toward an ITP but then settle to a lower level as a different branch of attractors is reached. In addition, there may be nonmonotonic EWS trends between ITPs. Each branch of attractors loses stability in two ITPs, one for decreasing and one for increasing freshwater forcing. Thus, any universal EWS should increase toward either end of the branch while being minimal at some mid-branch point. For each entire branch, the EWS should then be a u-shaped function of the control parameter ( Fig. 8, A and B ). During a monotonic parameter shift, the system can enter a given branch at a forcing value before or after the EWS minimum. In the former case, there is an initial decrease of EWS before the increase associated with the next ITP (red trajectories). Fig. 8. Changes in variability along the attractor branches leading up to the collapse of the overturning circulation. ( A  and  B ) Conceptual behavior of an ideal EWS indicator (A) in a sequence of two attractor branches (B) and corresponding ITPs. In a given branch, the EWS increases at the two ITPs (vertical dashed lines) for low and high forcing, yielding a u-shaped function [black curves in (A)]. A monotonic forcing increase across ITPs (red trajectories) can thus lead to nonmonotonic trends, as well as jumps in the EWS. ( C  and  D ) Corresponding behavior of the variance as EWS in our model simulations. (C) SD as a function of freshwater forcing, calculated from the last 1500 years of all equilibrium simulations comprising the sequence of branches and states that is obtained when following the bifurcation diagram ( Fig. 3A ) from the top left until the last vigorous state at around  F  = 0.36 Sv. The color coding is as in  Fig. 3A , and the mean overturning strength is shown in (D). Filled symbols are the parts of the branches that are actually visited during a monotonic freshwater increase. The open symbols are the other parts of the branches that are reached when instead decreasing the freshwater forcing. We next analyze the temporal variability of observables in our simulations of the equilibrium states along the control parameter, to investigate how an ideal EWS indicator may behave in the quasi-stationary limit of a slow, monotonic forcing increase. We consider the sequence of attractor branches that would most likely be traversed during such a freshwater increase. The variance of the AMOC strength is chosen as EWS, since increased variance is a common EWS that may also be useful in some cases with oscillatory dynamics, such as Hopf bifurcations ( 63 ) and bifurcations of periodically driven systems ( 64 ).  Figure 8 (C and D)  shows jumps in variance at ITPs, and in some cases, nonmonotonic trends between ITPs. But u-shaped curves concerning the entire branches are not found. Most branches see decreasing variance, but this is not a robust feature since the direction of trends depend strongly on the observable used (compare  Fig. 8, C and D , and fig. S25). The applicability of critical slowing down indicators (such as variance) in our model is thus not clear. The spectral changes of the AMOC strength leading up to the collapse do not indicate critical slowing down (fig. S3). Since usual EWS are not well suited for complex models featuring deterministic chaotic, as well as quasi-periodic dynamics, future studies should evaluate other statistics more suited for more complex, chaotic dynamics ( 65 ,  66 )."
90,discussion,"DISCUSSION Our results show that in a global ocean model, an eventual collapse of the AMOC due to increased meltwater discharge is preceded by ITPs. These events are abrupt changes in the mean state and variability of the AMOC in response to slow and gradual meltwater increase. Occurring already far from the full AMOC collapse, they could be relevant in the context of global warming by impacting regional climates and other modes of climate variability. From a dynamical systems perspective, ITPs are identical to what is commonly understood as a TP, i.e., the loss of stability of a branch of attractors and the subsequent transition to another coexisting attractor. By performing extensive equilibrium simulations, we showed that there is a large number of such attractors branches, i.e., a multitude of vigorous, collapsed and partially collapsed stable states of the circulation that coexist for a given strength of freshwater forcing. The resulting rugged stability landscape features up to nine coexisting stable states and appears to be organized hierarchically since the attractors seem to come in clusters at different scales. As a result, there may even be many more coexisting states on smaller scales of the observables and control parameter. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that identified two to three coexisting vigorous AMOC states in ocean models and associated these with distinct spatial patterns of NA convection ( 35 – 39 ,  41 ). We find coexisting states that have clearly different convective pattern. This may be understood as a spatially fragmented tipping of individual convection regions resulting from an underlying spatial heterogeneity, as has been proposed recently ( 34 ). On the other hand, we uncover a large number of additional coexisting attractors that feature slightly different mean AMOC strength but near-identical NA convection patterns. Such states can also differ substantially in their temporal variability. By making the NA bathymetry and surface forcings zonally symmetric, we showed that gradually increasing freshwater forcing still induces not only abrupt transitions to different spatiotemporal patterns but also abrupt, subtle changes in AMOC strength and temporal variability without changes in convective patterns. Extremely close-by coexisting states may be suspected an artifact of the model discretization and convective parameterizations, which may yield bistability between convective and nonconvective states at individual grid cells and thus a multitude of subtly different stable circulation patterns ( 35 ,  67 – 69 ). We cannot fully exclude this, as we lack a simplified model version with analytical solution ( 69 ) and as the construction of the entire stability landscape of alternative model versions with different convective parameterizations is beyond the scope of the paper. Our model uses a smooth variant of convective adjustment (see Materials and Methods and the code in the section S1), which is expected to be less prone to spurious equilibria ( 68 ,  69 ). Further, our simulations strongly suggest differences in the dynamics beyond the grid cell level. We found coexisting pairs of states where there is no qualitative difference in convective activity on the grid cell level (figs. S11 and S12), i.e., there is no grid cell that is permanently convecting in one state but permanently nonconvecting in the other state. These states feature patches of neighboring grid cells that oscillate between convective and nonconvective conditions at a decadal timescale. In general, there are marked quantitative differences in mean MLD of states that are very close-by in AMOC strength. These are typically distributed over the whole domain. Further, the differences are not static since there is a large internal temporal variability of MLD and AMOC strength. Amplitude and spectrum of this variability differ substantially for coexisting states. It should be tested whether close-by states persist at increased grid resolution. We have not demonstrated this explicitly due to computational constraints, but the existence of ITPs in our experiments with a doubled horizontal grid resolution at least suggests that multistability persists. Studies with idealized models have suggested that an increase in vertical resolution leads to an increasing number of coexisting states with decreasing separation between them ( 68 ,  69 ), whereby the multistability may presumably disappear in the continuum limit. While, because of the limited number of simulations with the higher resolution model, we can neither confirm nor refute this, our transient AMOC collapse simulation (fig. S15) does at least not suggest that the ITPs become more numerous. Since the setup with nominal resolution already has extremely close-by states, we cannot assess whether states are even more close-by in the setup with doubled resolution. Our usage of an ocean-only model excludes the possibility of the atmospheric temperature, precipitation, and wind fields to react to the freshwater-induced oceanic changes. Because of stabilizing/negative atmosphere-ocean feedbacks via a response of the atmospheric temperature field to the initial freshwater input, the AMOC weakening could be reduced, and thus, a potential collapse may occur only at even larger forcing ( 70 ,  71 ). Similarly, a decrease in NA precipitation in response to an AMOC collapse could in turn strengthen the AMOC via an increase in NA salinity leading to denser surface waters and increased convective activity. Changes in wind fields are also important to the AMOC response to freshwater forcing, which can only be captured adequately when including a high-resolution atmospheric model ( 71 ). It remains uncertain how the combination of different atmospheric feedbacks influences a freshwater-induced AMOC decline. Positive atmospheric feedbacks have also been found when comparing the AMOC response in coupled climate models to ocean-only models ( 72 ). Regarding the specific context of our study, it is not clear whether atmospheric feedbacks promote or prevent ITPs and high multistability. Negative feedbacks may remove some instabilities responsible for ITPs. On the other hand, further nonlinear atmospheric processes could enable additional spatiotemporal shifts in different climate subsystems, which could mean that ITPs become even more widespread. While at present we cannot identify all mechanisms of multistability in our model or prove that it is a robust feature, signatures of ITPs of the AMOC have been seen before in ocean-only models ( 73 ) and in many of the models of an intercomparison study of the AMOC hysteresis in intermediate complexity climate models ( 74 ). The multistability in our model is also consistent with recent studies showcasing complicated stability landscapes of the Earth system ( 42 ,  43 ) or complex ecosystems ( 33 ). The potentially hierarchical organization of the stability diagram in  Fig. 3A  is in agreement with the recently proposed multiscale multistability of the climate ( 44 ) and reminiscent of the self-similar bifurcation structure of recurring periodic windows at smaller and smaller scales in low-dimensional chaotic systems ( 75 ). It remains to be shown in future studies whether coupling to atmospheric variability will preserve the fine structure of the oceanic multistability. While it is possible that some of the very close-by attractors will not remain distinct states in the presence of atmospheric fluctuations, some previous modeling studies with dynamical atmospheric components did show high multistability ( 42 ,  43 ) or signatures consistent with ITPs ( 74 ). The rugged stability landscape implied by our simulations is illustrated schematically in  Fig. 9 . In such a landscape, small differences in the temporal variation of the control parameter could yield qualitatively different outcomes. This means, for instance, that safe limits for a temporary overshoot of the TP may be hard to define. Because multiple collapsed AMOC branches connect back to the vigorous regime ( Fig. 3A ), initial conditions and forcing trajectory could determine sensitively whether the AMOC can be recovered. Even a successful recovery after a reversal of the control parameter may lead to a different attractor than before the overshoot. This was seen in the hysteresis experiment, where a different equilibrium state was reached at a given control parameter after the decreasing parameter sweep (fig. S4). Fig. 9. Contrasting stability landscapes and tipping trajectories of bistable versus highly multistable systems. ( A ) Bistable stability landscape (top) superimposed on our previously published simulations of a collapse of the overturning circulation ( 61 ). For slow rates of forcing increase, the system’s trajectory (red) closely follows the stable equilibrium states (valleys in the landscape above, colored symbols below), until a TP is reached, which may be preceded by EWS. For fast forcing (green trajectory) rate-induced tipping can occur before the TP, where the system is not able to follow its equilibrium ( 61 ). ( B ) Rugged stability landscape heuristically derived from the simulations presented here. Up to nine stable states coexist in different regimes and disappear in intermediate TPs (green stars). This makes tipping more gradual, yet stepwise, dependent on initial conditions and the task of early warning highly nontrivial. The presence of high multistability adds another layer of fuzziness to the prediction of a TP, in addition to the indeterminacy of tipping for individual, rate-dependent TPs under chaotic dynamics ( 61 ,  62 ). In a smooth landscape, impending transitions may be predicted by EWS if there is no early, rate-induced tipping ( Fig. 9A ). In a rugged landscape, however, predicting the eventual collapse is hard, since the sequence of impending ITPs may depend on initial conditions and the rate of the parameter shift. Depending on the rate of change, different basins of attraction are visited between ITPs. The resulting variety of different changes in variability that can precede the eventual AMOC collapse complicates the design of universal EWS. From the observation of EWS alone, it is difficult to know how large the impending regime shift will be, since EWS only reflect changes in the local properties of the dynamical system. If they can be predicted—which may be hard since they occur before the parameter values where the corresponding attractors lose stability—ITPs may thus be mistaken for a complete AMOC collapse. In summary, our simulations demonstrate an abundance of abrupt changes in spatiotemporal variability that can occur considerably before an AMOC collapse and suggest a high degree of multistability of the ocean circulation. Verifying this in models of even higher dimensionality and complexity is computationally challenging. A complimentary approach may be detailed analyses of past AMOC transitions in climate proxy records. Many Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles during the last glacial period, which are likely due to tipping between a collapsed and vigorous AMOC state, show abrupt, small-amplitude warming events before an abrupt NA cooling (i.e., an AMOC collapse) ( 76 ). These so-called rebound events may be related to the ITPs reported here."
91,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Ocean model The simulations are done with Veros, a direct translation of the Fortran backend of the ocean model PyOM2 ( 77 ) into Python/JAX ( 78 ,  79 ). As primitive equation finite-difference global ocean model, it has the same dynamical core and mixing physics as other z-level ocean models like MITgcm or the CESM ocean model POP, but it is able to exploit GPU architectures and the ever expanding public Python libraries. Mesoscale turbulence is represented using the Redi ( 80 ) and Gent-McWilliams ( 81 ) parameterization for isopycnal and thickness diffusion (diffusivity of 1000 m 2 /s). We use the second-order turbulence closure of Gaspar  et al.  ( 82 ) to account for diapycnal mixing. Here, a background diffusivity of 10  −5  m 2 /s is used, and static instabilities are removed by a gradual increase of the vertical diffusivity as the instability is approached. This corresponds to a smoothed variant of convective adjustment. The particular implementation in the Veros model is given in section S1, and the resulting temporal evolution of the vertical diffusivity is shown in fig. S26 for an example simulation at some of the most convectively active grid cells. The heat exchange boundary condition is expressed by a first-order Taylor expansion of the heat flux as a function of the anomaly of the modeled surface temperature with respect to a fixed surface temperature climatology ( 83 ). For this, we use ERA-40 climatologies ( 84 ) of surface temperature and heat flux, as well as a climatology of the derivative of the heat flux with respect to changes in surface ocean temperature. The latter is derived from ERA-40 following Barnier  et al.  ( 85 ) and has a global yearly average 30.26 WK −1 m −2 . Wind stress forcing is also taken from the ERA-40 reanalysis data. Freshwater exchanges with the atmosphere are modeled by boundary conditions under which the sea surface salinity is relaxed toward a present-day ERA-40 climatological field within a given relaxation timescale. By choosing a long timescale of 2 years, oceanic salinity anomalies are less efficiently damped by the atmospheric forcing compared to temperature anomalies. This enables the positive salt advection feedback, which can lead to AMOC multistability and tipping. The bathymetry is obtained by smoothing the ETOPO1 global relief model ( 86 ) with a Gaussian filter to match the grid resolution. The model domain ends at 80°N and thereby does not feature an Arctic connection of ocean basins. The horizontal grid contains 90 longitudinal and 40 latitudinal cells, where the latitudinal resolution increases from 5.3° at the poles to 2.1° at the Equator, as well as 40 vertical layers, which increase in thickness from 23 m at the surface to 274 m at the bottom. To test the robustness of our results, we also performed simulations where the horizontal grid resolution is doubled. Two previous studies investigated AMOC tipping in this ocean model, and further model details can be found therein ( 61 ,  87 ). The latter study investigated tipping of the AMOC induced by volcanic cooling and features the exact same model configuration as used here. The former study considered rate-induced tipping of the AMOC in a slightly different model setup. Hysteresis experiment To perform a hysteresis experiment, a uniform freshwater forcing is introduced in the NA around Greenland (see fig. S27), which acts as the control parameter to induce an AMOC collapse. The model is initialized at the end of a 8000-year control run without freshwater forcing. Thereafter, a step-wise hysteresis experiment is performed. Here, the freshwater forcing is increased linearly by a value δ F  = 0.0043 Sv over a period of 200 years, after which it is held constant for 100 years. Thereafter, the next linear 200-year forcing increase by δ F  and subsequent 100-year relaxation follows. This procedure is continued until  F  = 0.429 Sv, after which the AMOC has fully collapsed. From the collapsed state, the forcing is reduced back to zero in the same step-wise manner. Continuation of attractor branches From the hysteresis experiment, we start equilibrium simulations at various constant forcing values to evaluate whether the hysteresis reflects true multistability or merely transient dynamics. To this end, initial conditions are taken both from the increasing and decreasing parameter sweep of the hysteresis experiment. The several primary branch points for the equilibrium simulations are shown in  Fig. 1A . They were chosen to correspond to forcing values just below and above those where a rapid change in AMOC state or variability was observed. After equilibration at each branch point, continuation experiments are performed as follows. From each branch point, two new simulations are started where the freshwater forcing is changed instantaneously by a very small positive or negative increment, respectively. Again, the forcing is held constant until the model has equilibrated, i.e., until the dynamics of relevant observables appear stationary. Here, we require the AMOC strength to display no notable trend for at least 2000 years. Besides the AMOC strength, as observables, we also evaluate the temporal evolution of surface and subsurface temperatures, salinities, and densities in different parts of the Atlantic. The integration is done for at least 3000 years but mostly substantially longer. Longer simulation times are used either because the dynamics could not be deemed stationary after 3000 years, to assure long-term stability of the corresponding branch of attractors, or to better distinguish close-by states. From the two simulations with negative and positive forcing increments, we start new simulations with another increment in the same direction to continue the branch of attractors along the control parameter in both directions. For practical reasons, in many cases, the new runs at altered forcing from a given simulation have been started somewhat before the simulation has fully equilibrated. While this still produces valid equilibrium simulations at the desired control parameter values, there is a slight risk of a premature escape from the current branch by a transition to a different basin of attraction due to rate-induced tipping. Continuation of a given branch is terminated when a qualitative shift to another, known branch of attractors, or to a previously unidentified state is observed. In the latter case, a new continuation experiment is started as above. Example timeseries obtained with this continuation method are given in fig. S28. We extend all branches in both directions by increasing and decreasing the control parameter until they are connected on either side with other known branches. At this stage, the continuation procedure cannot yield any new attractors. The method produced 280 distinct equilibrium simulations with a total simulation time of 1.96 million years and an average simulation time of 7,005 years. About 50% of the simulations were longer than 5300 years and 28% longer than 10,000 years. In addition, 119 simulations with perturbed initial conditions were performed, as explained in the following section. As stability of an attractor branch is lost after a parameter increment, we sometimes find long, gradual trends and transient changes of variability before a new branch is reached [see fig. S29 (A to F) for the most notable instances]. In this case, we simply increase the simulation time and integrate until the dynamics appears stationary and, if applicable, coincides with simulations on another branch. There were, however, a few cases of very long transients where we cannot establish with confidence what the stationary dynamics is (fig. S29, G to I). As a result of these transients, some branches may in reality lose stability earlier or later than determined by our finite-time equilibrium simulations. The long average simulation times and the investigation of many branches with many realizations each makes it unlikely that entire branches are only of transient nature. Nevertheless, the fact that long transients are possible makes it hard to prove that very close-by states are truly separate attractors and to identify with full certainty at what parameter values branches merge. In many cases, very long simulations of up to 25 ka were performed to ensure that the attractors do not slowly merge over time (e.g., fig. S30). But this could not be done exhaustively, and from the ensemble simulations with perturbed initial conditions (see the next section), we found further candidates for distinct branches of close-by attractors. Because of computational time constraints, not all trajectories were integrated long enough to establish this. Thus, the close-by branches that have been continued and are shown in  Fig. 3A  (inset) may be interpreted as a representative sample of a cluster of close-by, potentially only marginally stable states. Perturbed initial condition ensembles The equilibrium simulations that were started from the hysteresis simulation and continued along the control parameter ultimately stem from a small set of initial conditions. The continuation method only yields one initial condition per parameter value on each branch. To test whether a substantial number of branches may have been missed, and to show that the branches obtained during the continuation experiments are indeed attracting, we generate ensembles of additional initial conditions at a few specific values of the control parameter. For the values  F  = 0.339 Sv,  F  = 0.343 Sv,  F  = 0.347 Sv,  F  = 0.351 Sv, and  F  = 0.356 Sv within the multistable regime, we perform linear interpolations in between pairs of states on the vigorous and collapsed AMOC branches. The states were simply chosen as the snapshot at the last time step of the equilibrium simulations and thus correspond to arbitrary samples from the attractor. Then, 32 equally spaced initial conditions are chosen, which lie on a straight line in phase space, defined by the linear interpolation of these states. Each initial condition is integrated for at least 2500 years or until the dynamics were deemed stationary. The trajectories converged mostly to the attractors known from the continuation experiments, but in a few cases, new branches were discovered and subsequently continued in parameter space. This ensemble consisted of 216 simulations, with a total simulation time of 792,000 years. Together with the continuation method, this yields a total simulation time of 2.75 million years. Model experiments with zonally symmetric NA To investigate the role of heterogeneity in the NA in generating the observed multistability, we consider three configurations with different degrees of symmetry in boundary conditions. In the first configuration, only the topography and bathymetry are altered. This is done by removing Greenland and Iceland, as well as filling in the Arctic sea and choosing straight meridional boundaries down to 45°N at 300°E and to 36°N at 356°E. A uniform depth of 4000 m is chosen, although the implementation of shelves in the model leads to depths of around 1500 m along the outer perimeter of the domain. In the second configuration, also the temperature and salinity forcing is made zonally symmetric, by zonal averaging in the NA. Last, in the third configuration, also the horizontal wind stress fields are made zonally symmetric. Maps of the symmetrized bathymetry and forcing fields are shown in fig. S14. It is computationally prohibitive to construct the entire stability diagram for each case. Thus, we only perform one long transient simulation for each configuration, where the freshwater forcing is linearly ramped up very slowly until the AMOC collapses. This is sufficient to show whether ITPs occur. These simulations, started after 10 ka of spinup at present-day forcing, are shown in fig. S18."

94,introduction,"Introduction The tipping point is a critical threshold beyond which a small perturbation can qualitatively transform the state or evolution of a system 1 . A climate tipping point happens when a minor variation in forcing triggers a profound nonlinear response in the dynamic processes within the climate system, leading to an abrupt and irreversible regime shift 2 . There has been increasing awareness and concern that global warming could trigger tipping points in the climate system, introducing far-reaching influence on natural ecosystems and human societies 3 , which call for urgent political and economic actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep atmospheric CO 2  concentration below a safe level to mitigate the risk 4 . Several components of the Earth system have been identified as tipping elements that may reach or pass a tipping point when global warming exceeds a critical threshold such as 1.5 °C above preindustrial temperature 1 , 3 . The Earth system is a complex dynamical system with different components highly interconnected and interdependent, thus tipping in one element can lead to cascading changes in another 5 – 7 , and even could trigger a planetary-scale tipping point 8 , 9 . The global hydrological cycle, particularly the global monsoon system, has been suggested to be vulnerable to climate tipping points and may experience abrupt shifts in the future 10 . However, the direction and amplitude of abrupt shifts are unclear, mainly because the available observational records are too short to provide useful information 11 , and rainfall response is usually more difficult to constrain than temperature 12 . Paleoclimate records can provide the only long-term context for evaluating the impact of climate tipping points 11 . However, the precision, resolution, and spatial coverage of paleoclimate records are insufficient and need to be improved 11 . In the EASM domain, our understanding of paleomonsoon evolution mainly depends on the precisely-dated speleothem δ 18 O records 13 . However, the interpretation of speleothem δ 18 O records in East Asia remains debated, excluding it as a local rainfall proxy 13 – 16 . For instance, a speleothem trace-element record from Haozhu Cave in central-eastern China suggested wetter conditions during North Atlantic cold stadials when speleothem δ 18 O records indicated a weaker summer monsoon 15 . The situation is further complicated by inconsistent results of other proxy records in the same region 17 – 21 . Besides, the nonlinear behavior of the EASM is understudied, making it unclear whether changes in the EASM rainfall are gradual or abrupt. The potential for abrupt shifts in the EASM rainfall under excessive global warming were largely overlooked in both assessment reports and academic literature 1 , 3 , 22 , 23 . Absent from these debates is an independent quantitative reconstruction of past rainfall changes in the EASM realm, particularly in southern China. Southern China is the core region of EASM influence where annual rainfall exceeds 800 mm and rainfall variability is the largest (Fig.  1 ). Fig. 1 Spatial pattern of annual rainfall and its variability in East Asia. a  Spatial distribution of the mean of annual rainfall (Pann) in the period 1951–2020 CE.  b  Spatial distribution of the standard deviation (SD) of annual rainfall in the same period. The hexagons indicate the location of Qingtongyang Maar Lake in this study. The gridded monthly rainfall data version 2022 from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° 44  were used for analysis. In this study, we aim to provide a robust reconstruction of the EASM rainfall in southern China and use it to detect tipping points in the EASM rainfall since the LGM and assess the cascading impacts of climate tipping points on the EASM rainfall. The first goal is achieved by applying nine statistical and machine learning methods to retrieve rainfall signals from multi-proxy records of a maar lake in southern China. Our analysis indicates that the rainfall variability at the lake location is representative of rainfall variability in southern China (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The second goal is realized by comparing a large number of proxy records with multi-model simulations. We focus on two well-known tipping elements, the AMOC and Saharan vegetation cover 1 , 3 . The AMOC has a strong impact on global climate by conveying surface warm water northward and deep cold water southward, redistributing the solar energy received by the Earth 24 . Through its impact on the interhemispheric thermal gradient, the AMOC can alter the position and intensity of low-latitude rainfall systems, including the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the EASM 25 , 26 . In situ observations indicate that the AMOC has weakened during recent decades 27 , and the sea surface temperature (SST) fingerprint suggests that this weakening trend extends back to the mid-20th century 28 . Climate models further project the AMOC to weaken under future anthropogenic warming 29 . Recent studies even warn that the AMOC may collapse in the coming decades 30 , 31 . However, the climatic impact of AMOC collapse in the context of anthropogenic warming remains unclear. The last deglaciation is characterized by a large increase in the atmospheric CO 2  concentration and abrupt shifts in the AMOC 32 , providing an ideal analog for examining its future influence. The Sahara is currently the largest hot desert and source of dust emission on Earth, which plays a crucial role in regulating global climate and biophysical feedbacks 33 . Paleoenvironmental records indicate the greening of the Sahara during the African Humid Period (AHP) when the African summer monsoon intensified and rainfall increased in response to higher summer insolation 34 . Conversely, the termination of the AHP and collapse of Saharan vegetation during the mid- to late Holocene are an abrupt event occurring faster than orbital forcing 10 , 34 , 35 , which is a paradigm for going through climate tipping points 1 . Recent studies suggest that the changes in Saharan vegetation cover and dust emissions can not only influence local climate in northern Africa 36  but also the distant climates ranging from the tropics 37 , 38  to the Arctic 39 . The Asian summer monsoon could be affected by Saharan vegetation changes through large-scale atmospheric circulation such as the upper-level Rossby wave train and the Pacific Walker circulation 40 , 41 . However, the timing, amplitude, and structure of EASM rainfall changes in response to the end of the Green Sahara and AHP are not well defined due to the lack of high-resolution quantitative rainfall records. Given that the Sahara/Sahel vegetation and the West African monsoon have been identified as a tipping element that may experience abrupt shifts under future anthropogenic warming 1 , 3 , investigating the effect of Saharan vegetation change during the past will have practical implications for better understanding of vegetation feedback on future climate."
95,results,"Results and discussion Ensemble reconstruction of the EASM rainfall Quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions are closely related to climate proxy and reconstruction methodology 42 , 43 . We, therefore, employ a multi-proxy, multi-method probabilistic framework to generate a large ensemble for robust reconstruction of the EASM rainfall. The reconstruction target is anomalies in the annual rainfall (Pann) relative to 1961–1990 CE. The period 1953–2005 CE was chosen for calibration because it has the most complete climate data and overlaps with the proxy data. The period before 1953 CE was not used for calibration due to significant uncertainty in the climate data. However, gridded rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) 44  was utilized as an additional independent validation of our reconstructions. Because annual rainfall in East Asia is dominated by summer monsoon rainfall and their changes are highly correlated with similar amplitudes (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), we only reconstruct the annual rainfall. To preserve the full amplitude of rainfall variability and avoid spurious signals, both rainfall observations and proxy records were decadally smoothed with a cubic-smoothing spline 45  to have roughly the same frequency (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), following the suggestion of previous studies 46 – 48 . Smoothing can also enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and stabilize the relationship between climate and proxies, reducing the impact of age model uncertainty (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). From a sedimentological perspective, smoothing is necessary because climate signal is naturally smoothed during the deposition of lake sediments, and lake records are unable to capture the year-to-year climate variability as precisely as tree-ring records 47 , 48 . In November 2016, a sediment core (QTY-2-1) was recovered from the center of the Qingtongyang Maar Lake (110°10′E, 20°34′N, 131 m above sea level) in the Leizhou Peninsula, southern China. This lake is a closed-basin crater lake with a very small catchment and lack of river input, making it a natural gauge for past rainfall amount change. The core was split and subject to high-resolution color extraction and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) element scanning (Methods). The age model of the core is based on linear interpolation and extrapolation of the median values of sixteen AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry)  14 C dates with two outliers excluded, which have been calibrated to calendar years before present (BP), where present refers to 1950 CE (Methods, Supplementary Table  1 , and Supplementary Fig.  5 ). The age model over the past 150 years is constructed by the piecewise constant rate of supply (CRS) model 49  of  210 Pb dates constrained by the  137 Cs peak at 1963 CE and two post-bomb  14 C dates at 1955 CE and 2014 CE (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The full ranges of these post-bomb  14 C dates are only 2 to 3 years (Supplementary Table  1 ), ensuring a precise age model and allowing for meaningful calibration with rainfall observations on the decadal timescale. Even when assuming a larger age uncertainty by treating the full age range as one standard error and applying Bayesian age modeling to assess its impact, the rainfall-proxy relationship remains robust, regardless of changes to the age model (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Four climate-proxy records with nearly annual to decadal time-resolution were used as predictors for quantitative rainfall reconstructions, including the color b* and the concentrations of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and calcium (Ca) (Fig.  2 ). Color b* is a proxy for the concentration of goethite and hematite in lake sediment 50 . Fe and Mn concentrations are sensitive proxies for redox conditions in the lake at the time of sediment deposition 51 . Ca concentration indicates the content of carbonate in lake sediment 52 . Therefore, they are excellent indicators of past rainfall changes ( Supplementary Discussion ). Both correlation and partial-correlation analyses indicate a significant correlation with rainfall ( P  < 0.02) but a poor correlation with temperature during the calibration period 1953–2005 CE when accounting for the degrees of freedom (Supplementary Table  2 ), demonstrating that rainfall is the dominant controlling factor of changes in these proxy records and thus can be faithfully reconstructed. We used the expressed population signal (EPS) 53  and mean inter-series correlation (Rbar) 53  to evaluate the common variance of these proxy records over time with a sliding window of 3000 years. The EPS is a measure of how well a finite number of proxy records represents an infinite population chronology 53 . The Rbar indicates the average correlation between all possible pairs of proxy records 53 . The persistent positive values of sliding EPS and Rbar quantitatively indicate that these proxy records respond to a common climate signal and the proxy-climate relationships remain stable over time (Fig.  2e ). Our results indicate that the four proxy records from the Qingtongyang Maar Lake exhibit synchronous changes over the past 22,000 years, especially during the last deglaciation and mid-to-late Holocene when abrupt climate changes occurred, which is supported by higher EPS and Rbar values (Fig.  2 ). All proxy records show low values during the Bølling–Allerød (BA) interstadial and the early to middle Holocene, which qualitatively indicates anaerobic conditions in the lake and increased freshwater input ( Supplementary Discussion ).

The gray shadings indicate time intervals with high Rbar and EPS values and, thus, a strong common signal in the proxy records. All proxy records have been normalized to have zero mean and standard deviation units (Z-score) over the entire period for better comparison. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Our rainfall reconstruction ensemble consists of 14,850 members that account for uncertainties in the reconstruction method, proxy measurement, proxy selection, calibration period, weighting scheme, and regression residual. We use nine statistical and machine learning methods to reconstruct rainfall: composite plus scaling (CPS) and principal component regression (PCR) and their variants, i.e., optimal information extraction (OIE) and point-by-point regression (PPR), partial least squares (PLS) regression and two regularization methods, i.e., ridge regression (RIG) and elastic net (ELN), as well as two machine learning methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) (Methods). All methods use the same proxy matrix as input and each generates 1650 members of reconstruction. Cross-validations indicate that these methods have excellent performance in reconstructing rainfall variability, with the regularization and machine learning methods showing superior performance and a narrower range of uncertainties (Supplementary Table  3  and Supplementary Fig.  7 ). The rainfalls reconstructed by these methods closely track station-based rainfall observations during the period 1953–2005 CE and the GPCC rainfall during the period 1891–2005 CE (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Abrupt shifts in the EASM rainfall since the LGM The rainfall reconstructions obtained by the nine methods exhibit similar oscillations on the decadal to millennial timescales over the past 22,000 years (Fig.  3  and Supplementary Figs.  8 ,  9 ), indicating that our reconstruction is robust to the methodology used. Based on the framework of ensemble reconstruction, we consider as many uncertainties as possible when quantitatively reconstructing the EASM rainfall (Methods). The influence of age model uncertainty has also been considered. The age model uncertainty mainly affects the weights of proxy records and the timings of abrupt climate changes (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Therefore, we addressed this uncertainty by randomly adjusting proxy weights during reconstruction and applying Bayesian age modeling to ascertain the timings of abrupt shifts (Methods). Even after accounting for these uncertainties, the amplitudes of rainfall changes in our reconstructions during the past 22,000 years are still larger than the total uncertainties (Fig.  3  and Supplementary Figs.  8 ,  9 ), demonstrating that the reconstructed rainfall changes are significantly better than the stochastic process. Fig. 3 Ensemble reconstruction of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall over the past 22,000 years. The annual rainfall anomaly is expressed as deviations from the mean value of 1592 mm in the period 1961–1990 CE. The gray shading indicates the 95% confidence interval (from 2.5th to 97.5th percentile) of the reconstructions based on all methods ( N  = 14,850). The lines with different colors indicate the means of the reconstruction based on different methods ( N  = 1650). The triangles on the top indicate radiocarbon ( 14 C) age-control points. The daily mean of solar insolation at 20°N during summer (June-July-August, JJA) 64  is shown for comparison. LGM, Last Glacial Maximum; HS1 Heinrich stadial 1, BA Bølling–Allerød, YD Younger Dryas, EH early Holocene, MH mid-Holocene, LH late Holocene. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Consistent with the physical and chemical interpretations of the proxy records (Fig.  2  and  Supplementary Discussion ), all the quantitative reconstructions indicate that the EASM rainfall was most abundant during the BA interstadial and the early-middle Holocene, with rainfall amounts being ~440 mm (28%) higher than the modern value of 1592 mm in the period 1961–1990 CE. The rainfall was substantially lower during the LGM, Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), Younger Dryas (YD), and late Holocene, with the lowest rainfall occurring during the HS1. The general trend of the EASM rainfall evolution revealed by our reconstructions is consistent with the pattern of summer insolation change in the Northern Hemisphere, which peaked during the early Holocene (Fig.  3 ). However, unlike the gradual change in summer insolation, our rainfall reconstructions strongly suggest that the EASM rainfall was characterized by contrasting stable states and abrupt transitions between these states. Based on the regime shift analysis 54 , 55  (Supplementary Fig.  10 ), the evolution of the EASM rainfall over the past 22,000 years can be divided into six major climate states (or periods) that have different characteristics and internal dynamics, aligning with the LGM, HS1, BA, YD, early-middle Holocene, and late Holocene. The rainfall anomalies relative to the mean of 1592 mm in the period 1961–1990 CE during these periods are 141 ± 97 mm, −1 ± 98 mm, 447 ± 86 mm, 53 ± 89 mm, 440 ± 75 mm, and 102 ± 105 mm, respectively. Between two adjacent climate states are abrupt and irreversible shifts in rainfall amounts. Here, “abrupt” indicates that the change in a system is substantially faster than the rate of its past change, while “irreversible” indicates that the system does not recover to its previous state immediately after shift, but remains in a new state for a long time (>1000 years in this study) until its next shift 10 . Based on the Bayesian age modeling of our  14 C dates from the Qingtongyang Maar Lake (Methods), the timings of these abrupt shifts are estimated to be centered at 18860 ± 310, 14640 ± 400, 12870 ± 290, 11360 ± 170, and 4370 ± 60 yr BP (Supplementary Table  4 ). The transition from the HS1 to the BA is characterized by an abrupt increase in rainfall by 448 mm, while the transitions into and out of the YD are characterized by abrupt changes in rainfall by 394 mm and 387 mm, respectively. The transition from middle to late Holocene is characterized by a decrease in rainfall by 338 mm. The amplitude of rainfall decrease from the LGM to the HS1 is relatively small, with an amplitude of 142 mm, possibly because the rainfall amount during the LGM was low. Nonetheless, all rainfall changes are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level based on the two-tailed two-sample  t -test (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). These abrupt shifts can be identified by another objective method, the Bayesian change-point analysis 56 , which further supports our finding based on the regime shift analysis (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). These two independent methods are consistent in revealing the timings and structures of abrupt shifts in the EASM rainfall in most cases, but the Bayesian method can provide more details about the abrupt shift during the mid-to-late Holocene transition. Based on the Bayesian change-point analysis, the mid-to-late Holocene transition is characterized by an abrupt drop of rainfall with an amplitude of ~140 mm at 4370 ± 60 yr BP and a subsequent less abrupt but persistent decrease in rainfall with an amplitude of 416 mm until 3290 ± 70 yr BP (Supplementary Fig.  10  and Supplementary Table  4 ). Therefore, our reconstruction reveals a two-step abrupt shift in the EASM rainfall during the mid-to-late Holocene transition, which has implications for a better understanding of the forcing mechanisms and cultural consequence of the well-known 4.2 ka event 41 , 57 . To test the representativeness of our rainfall reconstruction, we compare our reconstruction with other proxy records from the same region, including the Huguangyan and Tianyang maar lakes (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Although the proxy records from Huguangyan and Tianyang have much lower temporal resolution, millennial-scale events such as the HS1 and YD are clearly identified, supporting that the abrupt shifts in our rainfall reconstruction are regional phenomena rather than local noises. We also make a comprehensive compilation of paleoclimate records from the whole EASM domain (Methods), which consistently indicate that abrupt shifts in the rainfall regime are a continental-scale feature and intrinsic mode of the EASM rainfall variability since the LGM (Supplementary Tables  5 –9 and Supplementary Figs.  12 ,  13 ). To help better understand the climatic significance of speleothem δ 18 O records in East Asia, we compare our rainfall reconstruction with the speleothem δ 18 O records from Dongge and Hulu caves in southern China (Supplementary Fig.  11d ). The strong similarity between them during the last deglaciation indicates that the speleothem δ 18 O records in East Asia might be indeed related to hydroclimate changes during this period. After accounting for the effect of global ice volume change, the speleothem δ 18 O values during the LGM are slightly lighter than those during the late Holocene. This is consistent with our reconstruction indicating higher rainfall amounts during the LGM than in the late Holocene. However, the changes in speleothem δ 18 O records during the Holocene are much more gradual, indicating decoupled changes between speleothem δ 18 O records and the East Asian hydroclimate. Previously, the speleothem δ 18 O records in East Asia were interpreted as monsoon wind intensity, which is positively (negatively) correlated with monsoon rainfall in northern (southern) China 58 . However, the decoupled changes between speleothem δ 18 O records and our rainfall reconstruction, as well as other hydroclimate records in East Asia, indicate that speleothem δ 18 O records are not a direct signal of monsoon rainfall. AMOC forcing of EASM rainfall during the last deglaciation The EASM rainfall change can be driven by both dynamic and thermodynamic components 59 , with the former related to monsoon circulation and the latter related to atmospheric water vapor. The global mean temperature during the LGM was 6.1 °C (95% confidence interval: 5.7–6.5 °C) cooler than that during the late Holocene 60 , and the associated thermodynamic effect was expected to reduce atmospheric water vapor content and thus lead to less rainfall in East Asia. However, our reconstruction indicates that the rainfall amount in southern China during the LGM was similar to or even higher than that during the late Holocene (Fig.  3 ). This finding suggests that the global mean temperature change may not be the dominant control of the EASM rainfall anomaly during the LGM, at least in the core monsoon region. Moreover, the reconstructed rainfall changes during the last deglaciation did not follow the gradual increasing trend in the global mean temperature 61 , 62  and atmospheric CO 2  concentration 63  (Fig.  4 ). Therefore, the observed variability in EASM rainfall is likely caused by other mechanisms, rather than a simple response to the thermodynamic effect of changes in the global mean temperature.

LGM Last Glacial Maximum, HS1 Heinrich Stadial 1, BA Bølling–Allerød, YD Younger Dryas, EH early Holocene. The only climatic forcing that shared similarity between the LGM and late Holocene is the local summer insolation at 20°N 64  (Fig.  3 ). We, therefore, attribute the similar rainfall amounts to the dynamic effect of nearly identical summer insolation, which could compensate for the thermodynamic effect of global mean temperature through changes in the land-sea thermal contrast and latitudinal temperature gradient. However, insolation forcing alone cannot explain the EASM rainfall changes during the last deglaciation when the EASM rainfall was punctuated by two millennial-scale drought events (i.e., HS1 and YD) at times of high summer insolation (Fig.  3 ). In contrast, the oscillation of deglacial EASM rainfall was in parallel with the AMOC strength 65  and the interhemispheric temperature gradient 61  (Fig.  4 ), indicating a dominant role of the AMOC forcing. The AMOC has experienced tipping points for abrupt transition between strong states and weak states during the last deglaciation 65 , which could have strong impacts on the EASM rainfall 15 , 66 . For instance, remarkable weakening of the AMOC during the HS1 and YD 65  reduced northward heat transport and generated a bipolar temperature seesaw pattern, with cooling in the Greenland 67  and Northern Hemisphere and warming in the Antarctic 68  and Southern Hemisphere, which diminished the interhemispheric temperature gradient 61  and forced the ITCZ to move southward, reducing rainfall in East Asia (Fig.  4 ). Comparison of our rainfall reconstruction with hydroclimate records along a north-south transect across the East Asian-Australian monsoon system reveals an opposite rainfall pattern between the two hemispheres during the last deglaciation (Supplementary Fig.  14 ), supporting a southward migration of the ITCZ mean position during the HS1 and YD in response to the weakening of the AMOC during the HS1 and YD 26 , 69 . The cooling of the North Atlantic during the HS1 and YD can also influence the EASM rainfall via changes in the intensity and position of the westerlies 15 , 66 , 70 . However, the spatial pattern of EASM rainfall response to abrupt shifts in the AMOC during the last deglaciation remains ambiguous due to the lack of a systematic analysis of both proxy records and climate simulations. For instance, a recent study based on a trace-element record from Haozhu Cave and a hosing experiment under preindustrial conditions suggests that central-eastern China was wet (dry) during the times of a weak (strong) AMOC and the rainfall anomaly in East Asia exhibited a tripole mode 15 . The Haozhu record further indicates that the climate during the LGM was wetter than that of the early Holocene 15 . However, a wetter central-eastern China during North Atlantic cold events and LGM is challenged by other proxy records from the same region 17 – 21 , including two trace-element records from Heshang Cave 17  and Hulu Cave 21 . Moreover, another hosing experiment under the LGM boundary conditions indicates rainfall decrease rather than increase in central-eastern China in response to the weakening of the AMOC 66 , which highlights the need for multi-model comparison. Previous studies mainly focused on the response of EASM rainfall to the weakening of the AMOC but overlooked the impact of AMOC strengthening. However, the responses of climate to the weakening and strengthening of the AMOC may not be a reversed process. In particular, abrupt shifts in the AMOC during the last deglaciation were accompanied by variations in other climatic forcings such as solar insolation, ice sheet, and greenhouse gas concentrations. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the individual characteristics of EASM rainfall response during both the transitions into and out of HS1 and YD, which has not yet been done. Here we collect a large number of hydroclimate records in East Asia based on rigorous criteria (Methods, Supplementary Tables  5 –8) and compare them with a state-of-the-science isotope-enabled transient climate experiment (iTRACE) 16  and an earlier version without isotope module (TRACE-21ka) 71  (Methods). Although continuous records with good age control and high temporal resolution are scarce for the last deglaciation, the general trend of hydroclimate change can be roughly inferred from these proxy fragments. From LGM to HS1, the majority of proxy records, including the trace-element record from Haozhu Cave 15 , indicate a drying climate over East Asia, except for two proxy records from southeastern China 72 , 73 , which indicate a wetting climate (Fig.  5a–c  and Supplementary Table  5 ). In contrast to the proxy records, the iTRACE simulation indicates that both annual and summer rainfalls increased during the HS1 relative to the LGM over Mongolia and eastern China (Fig.  5a, b ). In the TRACE-21ka simulation, the annual and summer rainfalls increased in northern China and northeastern China but decreased in southern China (Supplementary Fig.  15a, b ). Since it has been suggested that autumn rainfall could contribute to the changes in East Asian hydroclimate 74 , we also analyze the response to autumn rainfall. Indeed, the magnitude of autumn rainfall variability is comparable to that of summer rainfall and even larger (Fig.  5c ). The decrease in autumn rainfall in northeastern China can partly explain the discrepancy between proxy records and model simulations in this region, but not for that in northern China and southern China. As revealed by sensitivity experiments, the summer rainfall variability in northern China is driven primarily by summer insolation and secondarily by meltwater, while summer rainfall variability in southern China is driven primarily by meltwater and secondarily by summer insolation 16 . In the iTRACE simulation, the increasing summer insolation during the HS1 tends to increase summer rainfall in northern China and northeastern China but decrease summer rainfall in southern China, while the weakened AMOC tends to decrease summer rainfall in northern China and northeastern China but increase summer rainfall in southern China 16 . As a consequence, summer rainfall in the whole of eastern China increased during the HS1 in the iTRACE simulation (Fig.  5b ). However, such a response of EASM rainfall in the iTRACE simulation may not be realistic as it is inconsistent with the currently available proxy records (Supplementary Table  5 ) and there are large uncertainties in simulating rainfall response in East Asia to meltwater forcing 75 . We argue that the effect of AMOC slowdown on the global summer climate during HS1 might have been underestimated. For instance, summer cooling during the HS1 is limited to the North Atlantic in the iTRACE simulation, and the Eurasian continent experiences summer warming (Fig.  6b ). The warming of the Eurasian continent may have been responsible for the simulated rainfall increase in East Asia during the HS1. However, a recent reconstruction of summer temperature in northeastern China based on the distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in the sediment core from the Arxan Lake indicates substantial summer cooling during the HS1 76 .

LGM Last Glacial Maximum, HS1 Heinrich Stadial 1, BA Bølling–Allerød, YD Younger Dryas, EH early Holocene. From HS1 to BA, all proxy records, except for the trace-element record from Haozhu Cave 15 , indicate a wetting climate over the whole of East Asia (Fig.  5d–f  and Supplementary Table  6 ). The iTRACE simulation shows that both annual and summer rainfalls, as well as autumn rainfall, increased in northeastern China and northern China but decreased in southern China during the BA period (Fig.  5d–f ). Similar to the iTRACE simulation, annual and autumn rainfalls in southern China decreased during the BA in the TRACE-21ka simulation, but summer rainfall increased in both northern and southern China (Supplementary Fig.  15d–f ). The global temperature during the transition from HS1 to BA is characterized by strong warming in the Northern Hemisphere with small cooling in the Southern Hemisphere and weak warming in Antarctica (Fig.  6c, d ), while the transition from LGM to HS1 is characterized by strong cooling in the North Atlantic and strong warming in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig.  6a, b ). These evidences suggest that the climatic transition from HS1 to BA is not a simple reverse of the transition from LGM to HS1. From BA to YD, all proxy records, except for the trace-element record from Haozhu Cave 15 , indicate a drying climate over the whole of East Asia (Fig.  5g–i  and Supplementary Table  7 ). The iTRACE simulation shows that annual, summer, and autumn rainfalls significantly increase in southern China, southwestern China, and North China Plain, but decrease in northeastern China, semi-arid northern China, and northeastern Tibetan Plateau (Fig.  5g–i ). The simulated summer rainfall in the northern part of northeastern China also increased during the YD, but not significantly. The TRACE-21ka simulation shows rainfall increase in both northern and southern China (Supplementary Fig.  15g–i ). The global temperature during the transition from BA to YD is characterized by strong cooling in the Northern Hemisphere and strong warming in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig.  6e, f ). Unlike the temperature response during the HS1, the simulated summer cooling during the YD is not limited to North Atlantic, and the summer temperature in East Asia decreased during the YD in the iTRACE simulation (Fig.  6f ). This difference may explain the better agreement between proxy records and model simulation during the YD than HS1. From YD to early Holocene, all proxy records, except for a trace-element record from Haozhu Cave 15  and a hopanoid record from Dajiuhu peatland 77 , indicate a wetting climate over the whole of East Asia (Fig.  5j–l  and Supplementary Table  8 ). This pattern is generally consistent with the model results from the TRACE-21ka simulation (Supplementary Fig.  15j–l ). The rainfall response at that time in the iTRACE simulation is in good agreement with proxy records from northeastern China, northern China, southwestern China, and the Leizhou Peninsula (Fig.  5j–l ). However, the iTRACE simulation shows a rainfall decrease in southeastern China where various proxy records indicate an increasing rainfall. This divergence is robust and cannot be attributed to shortcomings in proxy records, because a well-dated speleothem carbon isotope (δ 13 C) record from Shennong Cave clearly indicates higher rainfall during the early Holocene than the YD 78 . The transition from YD to early Holocene in the iTRACE is characterized by warming in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the strongest warming occurring in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig.  6g, h ). This pattern is generally consistent with global temperature reconstruction 61 . Taken together, there are large discrepancies between proxy records and climate model simulations in reconstructing the hydroclimate of southern China during the last deglaciation, particularly for the iTRACE simulation running with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We argue that these discrepancies may be attributable to the inability of climate models in correctly simulating the EASM rainfall pattern. It has been suggested that the coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) have large biases in simulating the mean state of the tropical Pacific with an excessive equatorial Pacific cold tongue when compared to observations 79 . As a result, current CGCMs are unable to accurately reproduce the spatial pattern of EASM rainfall during different seasonal stages, with the rain belt shifting northward too quickly 80 . For example, the position of the spring and pre-Mei-Yu rain belts are shifted northward compared to rainfall observations, resulting in deficient rainfall in southern China 80 . Link to the end of Green Sahara and associated feedbacks The climate boundary conditions during the mid- to late Holocene are largely constant 81 . Therefore, abrupt shifts in EASM rainfall under gradual insolation forcing must involve strongly nonlinear feedbacks. We attribute it to the end of the Green Sahara and associated vegetation-dust-cryosphere feedbacks (Fig.  7 ). However, the timing of the termination of the Green Sahara has not been well defined, with previous studies showing different results 34 , 35 . Therefore, our first goal is to objectively estimate this timing. Based on six high-resolution and well-dated leaf wax hydrogen isotopic composition (δD wax ) records from the West African and East African monsoon regions (Supplementary Table  10 ), we generate a synthesis of African summer monsoon that considers uncertainties in both proxy measurement and age model (Methods, Fig.  7e  and Supplementary Fig.  16 ). Based on regime shift analysis 54 , 55  and Bayesian change-point analysis 56 , the timing of the termination of the Green Sahara is estimated to be 4620 ± 180 yr BP, after which the African summer monsoon experienced a rapid decline with the rate of change exceeding two standard deviations during the Holocene (Supplementary Fig.  16 ). The timing of abrupt decline in the African summer monsoon is estimated to be centered at 4350 ± 140 yr BP (Supplementary Fig.  16 ), statistically coinciding with abrupt rainfall decrease at 4370 ± 60 yr BP in our reconstruction based on the reduced chi-square test 82  (χ 2  = 0.017;  P  = 0.9). This timing also coincides with strong reductions in the tropical trees and Sahelian grassland cover in the Saharan region as evidenced by a continuous pollen record from Lake Yoa in northern Chad 83  (Fig.  7g ). Similarly, these events coincide with the onset of maximum dust flux recorded in the Kilimanjaro ice core 84  and marine sediment cores from the Nile Delta 85  and the Gulf of Oman 86  (Fig.  7f ), the timing of which was estimated to be centered at 4260 ± 66 yr BP 87  (χ 2  = 0.78;  P  = 0.46). These evidences suggest that the abrupt reduction in the EASM rainfall during the mid- to late Holocene is synchronous with the rapid degeneration of regional vegetation and abrupt increase in dust emissions across the Sahara in response to the termination of the Green Sahara. We further examine the climatic effect of changes in the Saharan vegetation and dust by performing two sets of mid-Holocene (MH) sensitivity experiments using the European Community Earth System Model (EC-Earth): one control experiment driven by orbital forcing only (MHORB), and an idealized experiment (MHGSRD) incorporating orbital forcing and a vegetated Sahara with reduced dust emissions (Methods).

The deterioration of vegetation at the end of the Green Sahara could influence the climate by increasing surface albedo 88  and enhancing dust mobilization 36 , which jointly reduce the absorption of solar radiation and enhance radiative cooling of the troposphere. The climatic impacts of the end of the Green Sahara are not limited to northern Africa and can affect the global climate from the tropics to the poles 89 . Our sensitivity experiments suggest that the reduced vegetation cover and increased dust emissions in the Saharan region could cause global surface cooling during both summer and winter, with the most pronounced cooling occurring in northern Africa, West Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and the northern high latitudes (Fig.  8a, c, e ). The cooling of northern Africa and West Asia is directly related to the increase in local land-surface albedo and atmospheric dust concentrations 36 , while the cooling of the Tibetan Plateau and northern high latitudes is linked to the amplification of cryosphere feedbacks, such as changes in snow cover and sea ice extent 39 . The asymmetric cooling between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres due to different land-sea configurations could alter the interhemispheric temperature gradient (Fig.  7c ) 90  and shift the ITCZ southward, thereby reducing the rainfall in East Asia. Additionally, the cooling of the northern high latitudes can influence the EASM rainfall through changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is defined as the difference in surface sea level pressure between the subpolar Icelandic Low and the subtropical Azores High, which controls the strength and direction of the westerlies and storm tracks across the North Atlantic 91 . At 4384 ± 23 yr BP (weighted mean), the reconstructed NAO index shifted from primarily positive phases to a weakly positive phase with intermittent strong negative phases 92  (Fig.  7b ), which closely tracks the change in the EASM rainfall ( χ 2  = 0.047;  P  = 0.83), indicating an inherent dynamical connection between them. The shift of NAO into more negative phases in response to the termination of the Green Sahara can also be reproduced in our climate model simulations, which indicate increasing sea level pressure in the northern Europe and/or Nordic Seas together with decreasing sea level pressure in the Azores and/or southern Europe (Fig.  8b, d, f ). The NAO persistently influences the surface temperature and snow cover over the Eurasian continent, sea ice and SST in the North Atlantic from winter to summer 93 . The NAO-induced SST anomalies in the North Atlantic can excite a wave train propagating toward East Asia, which affects the large-scale atmospheric circulation and, thus, regional rainfall pattern 94 . In addition, the negative NAO could weaken the wind-driven AMOC and reduce the poleward ocean heat transport in the North Atlantic 39 , further reducing the interhemispheric temperature gradient and the EASM rainfall. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the basin-scale AMOC remained fairly stable throughout the Holocene 95 . Therefore, the feedbacks associated with the Holocene AMOC likely play a minor role. In contrast, the Tibetan Plateau, known as the world’s third pole with an average elevation of 4000 m, may play a more significant role in shaping the EASM rainfall. The snow-albedo feedback may have amplified the temperature response on the Tibetan Plateau to the end of the Green Sahara. An alkenone-based summer temperature reconstruction from the Qinghai Lake on northeastern Tibetan Plateau indicates a substantial cooling (>5 °C) between 5 and 3.5 ka 96  (Fig.  7d ). Since the Tibetan Plateau is the main heat source driving the Asian summer monsoon 97 , its abrupt cooling during the end of the Green Sahara could weaken land-sea thermal contrast and greatly reduce the EASM rainfall.

The maps show annual (ANN) ( a ,  b ), summer (JJA) ( c ,  d ) and winter (DJF) ( e ,  f ) differences in the TS ( a,

Blue circles indicate the Qinghai Lake with a cooling climate during the same period. The marks “+” indicate the Icelandic Low with increasing SLP in response to the end of the Green Sahara, while the marks “–” indicate the Azores High with reducing SLP at the same time, which resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO–). Blue lines indicate the boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. To reveal the spatial pattern of EASM rainfall response to the termination of the Green Sahara, we collect a wealth of hydroclimate records in East Asia based on rigorous criteria (Methods, Supplementary Table  9 ) and compare them with four climate model simulations (Fig.  9 ). In addition to our sensitivity experiments conducted with the EC-Earth model 36  (Methods), similar experiments based on the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) 98 , the water isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model (iCESM) 99 , and climate model from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) 100  were included for multi-model comparison. Consistent with the proxy records (Supplementary Table  9 ), nearly all climate models simulate decreasing annual and summer rainfalls in northeastern China, northern China, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and southwestern China in response to the desertification of the Sahara (Fig.  9 ). However, the simulated increases in annual and summer rainfalls in southern China contrast with the available proxy records there (Supplementary Table  9  and Fig.  9 ). Similar to the last deglaciation, we argue that the biases in climate models are likely responsible for this model-proxy discrepancy. We also analyze the changes in autumn rainfall in climate simulations, which show a better agreement with proxy records (Fig.  9 ). In particular, the EC-Earth and CCSM4 models simulate a widespread autumn drying over the whole East Asia, closely resembling the pattern of proxy records (Fig.  9 ). Fig. 9 Multi-model simulations showing rainfall response in East Asia to the end of the Green Sahara. The maps show annual, summer and autumn rainfall differences between the simulations MHORB (mid-Holocene experiment with orbital forcing only) and MHGSRD (mid-Holocene experiment with orbital forcing, a vegetated Sahara and reduced dust emissions) performed with EC-Earth 36  ( a – c ), CCSM4 98  ( d – f ), iCESM 99  ( g – i ), and GISS 100  ( j – l ), respectively. Pann: annual rainfall; Pjja: summer rainfall; Pson: autumn rainfall. Brown (blue) hexagrams (this study) and circles indicate proxy records with drying (wetting) climate during the mid- to late Holocene transition. In summary, our quantitative reconstructions of the EASM rainfall amount changes over the past 22,000 years based on multi-methods and multi-proxies provide a benchmark for understanding the forcing and response of EASM rainfall in the context of long-term climate change. Our reconstructions suggest that the EASM rainfall since the LGM is characterized by alternative contrasting stable states and abrupt shifts between these states, indicating a strongly nonlinear nature of the EASM rainfall. In particular, we uncover and define five prominent tipping points in the EASM rainfall, which are linked to abrupt shifts in the AMOC and/or Saharan vegetation cover. In combination with comprehensive paleoclimate data compilations and multi-model simulations, we have drawn a picture of the EASM rainfall responses to abrupt shifts in the AMOC and Saharan vegetation. Our finding that the EASM rainfall was tightly coupled with known tipping elements in the Earth system during the past has practical implications for future change in the EASM rainfall under anthropogenic global warming. The potential “tipping” of tipping elements when global warming exceeds a specific threshold can trigger domino effects on the EASM rainfall and threaten the lives of billions of people."

99,introduction,"INTRODUCTION Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions have been causing long-term global warming with adverse effects on nature and people, which will continue to cause further changes in the climate system, ecosystem, and humanity ( 1 – 4 ). To reduce climate-related risks, the 2015 Paris Agreement aims to pursue efforts to limit global warming to well below 2°C and preferably to 1.5°C, compared to the preindustrial level ( 5 ). Most analyzed pathways, consistent with these climate targets, involve reaching net-zero emissions and transitioning to net-negative emissions through the use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques ( 6 – 9 ). In assessing the effectiveness and potential risks of mitigation pathways that rely on CDR, the reversibility, hysteresis, or tipping points of the Earth’s system are key factors to be considered ( 10 ). It has been reported that many aspects of the physical climate system, such as temperature, precipitation, and sea ice, are largely reversible on the global scale, although in general with some hysteresis (dependence of the state of a system on its history) ( 11 – 16 ). However, among several components of the Earth system, carbon (C) release from permafrost is expected to be irreversible, manifesting fully on longer timescales ( 11 ,  17 ). Permafrost-affected soils in the northern circumpolar permafrost region store approximately 1460 to 1600 PgC ( 18 ,  19 ). As the Earth warms, permafrost thaw will lead to the decay of organic carbon in permafrost-affected soils, releasing additional greenhouse gases such as CO 2  and methane (CH 4 ) into the atmosphere ( 19 – 24 ). This carbon release from the permafrost-affected soils has the potential to further amplify human-induced global warming ( 22 ,  25 ,  26 ). In addition, as the climate warms, plants are expected to grow faster and absorb more carbon from the atmosphere, which could help offset some of the carbon losses from the soil ( 27 ,  28 ). Because of these opposing effects, the changes in permafrost net carbon balance in response to net-zero and negative emissions are expected to be complex. This has a critical impact on the future responses of the coupled carbon-climate system to anthropogenic emissions. Therefore, we need to understand the changes in a permafrost region under mitigation pathways: When and how much ecosystem carbon (sum of vegetation, litter, and soil C) will be emitted from the permafrost region and what is the ratio of CO 2  to CH 4 ? To date, the reversibility and hysteresis of permafrost extent and permafrost C cycle have been investigated on the basis of idealized CO 2  ramp-up and ramp-down forcing experiments using Earth system models (ESMs) ( 11 ,  29 ). The permafrost area exhibits hysteresis as a function of CO 2  concentration and global mean surface temperature, with less permafrost extent in the CO 2  ramp-down period due to its slow recovery ( 11 ,  30 ). It is also suggested that although the permafrost extent would eventually be reversible, the loss of organic carbon in permafrost while thawed would be irreversible ( 11 ,  29 ,  31 ). However, the carbon-climate feedback is not fully considered in previous studies because they are based on idealized concentration-driven simulations ( 32 ). In addition, the inferred emissions pathway is highly discontinuous and impractical ( 10 ,  33 ). Therefore, it is still unclear how changes in permafrost and its carbon dynamics will affect the climate system under mitigation pathways. Recent studies based on various emission-driven simulations involving net-zero and negative emissions phases have shown that changes in permafrost extent depend on temperature, which is influenced not only by radiative forcing but also by the behavior of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) ( 10 ,  34 ). During the positive emission phase, permafrost degrades due to global warming, and then after the onset of net-zero and negative emissions, permafrost extent increases again with decreasing temperature ( 10 ,  34 ). However, as the weakened AMOC begins to recover, surface warming occurs in the northern mid-to-high latitudes, which leads to the permafrost rethaw, although its timing and magnitude vary between scenarios and models. These pronounced temperature fluctuations in the northern high latitudes under net-zero and negative emissions would have ramifications on both Arctic ecosystems and permafrost soils, complicating the understanding of the net ecosystem C balance in permafrost regions. Here, we aim to understand changes in permafrost depending on CDR options (net-zero or negative emissions) and its role in climate change. Accordingly, this study addresses the following questions: (i) How will permafrost extent and active layer thickness (ALT) change under net-zero and negative emissions? (ii) How much permafrost ecosystem carbon will be emitted or absorbed along the mitigation emission pathways? (iii) What are the major processes responsible for these changes? (iv) Does hysteresis of permafrost exist under net-zero and negative emissions, and if so, how will it affect the net ecosystem carbon balance? To address these questions, we performed emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art ESM that includes a representation of permafrost dynamics [Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) coupled with the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5); see Materials and Methods] ( 35 ). The simulations are based on two idealized and continuous emission pathways involving net-zero or negative emissions (Exp_zero or Exp_neg) after the positive anthropogenic CO 2  emissions ( Fig. 1A ; see Materials and Methods). Here, near-surface permafrost is defined as areas where the simulated maximum ALT is shallower than 4 m ( 19 ,  34 ,  36 ). The temperature and carbon stock in the permafrost region are calculated on the basis of the initial permafrost domain (fig. S1). Fig. 1.

100,results,"RESULTS Changes in near-surface permafrost under net-zero and negative emission pathways The near-surface air temperature (SAT) in the permafrost region almost follows the changes in atmospheric CO 2  concentrations ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, SAT is substantially affected by the behavior of the AMOC, mainly later in the experiments. SAT increases by ~4 K during the positive emissions phase and then decreases with decreasing CO 2  concentrations after the onset of net-zero and negative emissions. In Exp_zero, atmospheric CO 2  concentration declines gradually from its peak to the end of the simulation [730 to 610 parts per million (ppm)] but remains higher than its initial level, keeping permafrost regions warmer even beyond the peak of CO 2  levels. Despite declining CO 2  concentrations, the SAT rises slightly after year 2250 due to the partial recovery of the AMOC. These results are consistent with previous results shown in the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) SSP5-3.4-overshoot (SSP5-3.4) overshoot scenario and an idealized CO 2  ramp-up and ramp-down experiment ( 10 ,  31 ,  34 ,  37 ,  38 ). In Exp_neg, from the onset of the negative emissions phase, the CO 2  concentration gradually declines, results in surface cooling, and eventually reaches its initial state. At the time of the initial recovery of CO 2 , the temperature is about 1°C lower than its initial state due to the cooling caused by the weakening of the AMOC. Similarly, in Exp_zero, the SAT recovers faster than the rate of change of CO 2  due to the cooling induced by the AMOC. During the restoring period (phase of net-zero emissions) in Exp_neg, the AMOC exhibits a strong recovery unlike in Exp_zero, and thus, the temperature in the Northern Hemisphere increases considerably. As a result, considerable warming occurs in the permafrost region, comparable to its state at the CO 2  peak, although CO 2  concentrations increase slightly (~50 ppm) compared to the initial state. That is, if negative emission is deployed after the phase of positive emissions, then a strong temperature fluctuation would occur in the permafrost regions, which is consistent with previous studies ( 10 ,  34 ). The extent of near-surface permafrost highly depends on the SAT, consistent with previous studies ( 11 ,  30 ,  34 ,  39 ). In Exp_zero, a thawing-refreezing pattern emerges according to the warming-cooling cycle. In Exp_neg, the temperature fluctuations (warming-cooling-warming) lead to a thawing-refreezing-rethawing cycle ( Fig. 1B  and fig. S1). In Exp_zero, during the early phase of net-zero emissions (from year 2123 to 2197), the temperature recovers by ~49%, whereas the permafrost extent only recovers by 24%. In Exp_neg, it cannot fully recover despite the temperature in year 2197 being lower than the initial state, suggesting the presence of hysteresis in permafrost extent. Particularly along the initial boundary of permafrost zone in North America, the near-surface permafrost does not recover, resulting in a slow recovery of permafrost extent (fig. S1). Evolution of net ecosystem C balance in permafrost under mitigation pathways Next, we examined the temporal evolution of the ecosystem carbon cycle in the permafrost region ( Fig. 2A ). During the positive emissions phase, a consistent trend emerges with vegetation C pool steadily increasing, possibly due to the CO 2  fertilization effect and pan-Arctic warming ( 27 ), while the sum of litter and soil C pool decreases. In the first half, vegetation C uptake exceeds the loss of litter and soil C through respiration, thereby increasing the total ecosystem C (fig. S2). However, from around year 2060, litter-soil C begins to decline sharply and thus overwhelms the increase in vegetation C, resulting in a net loss of ecosystem C in the permafrost region. As a result, the total ecosystem C anomaly returns to zero at the beginning of the net-zero and negative emissions. Fig. 2. Changes in terrestrial carbon stocks in the permafrost region. ( A ) Time series of the 11-year running mean of annual mean vegetation, litter-soil, and total ecosystem carbon pool anomalies relative to the year 2000. All values are averaged over the initial permafrost domain. Gray solid lines show the evolution of the permafrost area. ( B ) Litter-soil carbon pool anomaly in the year 2197 relative to the year 2000 in Exp_zero and ( C ) Exp_neg. The simulated permafrost boundaries for the years of 2000 and 2197 are shown as blue and green lines, respectively. Hatched areas indicate the permafrost extent for each period. ( D ) Initial soil carbon content in the northern mid-high latitudes. Regions with high organic content are defined by an organic matter content of >75 kgC/m 2 , and their boundary is shown as a red line. All calculations were conducted after taking the 11-year running mean and then averaging (ensemble mean). After the cessation of the positive emissions in Exp_zero, net C uptake by vegetation, i.e., net primary production (NPP), begins to decrease as CO 2  concentration and temperature decline ( Fig. 1  and fig. S2), but vegetation C remains stable, possibly due to the inherent lag in the terrestrial C pool ( 40 ,  41 ). However, because of the continuous loss of litter and soil C pool caused by high temperature, the total ecosystem C gradually decreases, thereby resulting in a total ecosystem C loss of ~14 PgC by the end of the simulation ( Fig. 2A ). In Exp_neg, during the negative emission phase (from year 2124 to 2196), as CO 2  and SAT recover, NPP decreases and returns close to its initial state, which leads to the decline in vegetation carbon of ~3.5 PgC ( Figs. 1  and  2A  and fig. S2). In addition, during the same period, the respiratory C loss continues due to an incomplete recovery of permafrost extent, resulting in a reduction in litter-soil C of ~6.2 PgC ( Figs. 1B  and  2  and fig. S1). This reduction can also be partially attributed to the delayed increase in respiration resulting from the previously increased NPP ( 29 ,  41 ). Although the permafrost area recovers more than twice as much in Exp_neg in the same time period, litter-soil C emissions are similar in the two scenarios. This is because the intensive respiratory C loss occurs prominently along the initial boundary of permafrost in North America, which exhibits slow recovery due to its high soil organic matter (SOM) content ( Fig. 2, B to D , and figs. S1 and S3). In Exp_neg, during the restoring period, as the temperature increases due to the recovery of AMOC and CO 2  concentrations rebound, vegetation C slightly increases again. However, as temperature rises and permafrost degrades, litter and soil C continue to decrease until the end of the simulation. As a result, despite the deployment of artificial CO 2  removal of ~800 PgC only in Exp_neg, the magnitude of change in total ecosystem C by 2300 is similar between the two scenarios. In summary, during the positive emission period, permafrost acts as a net C sink but thereafter becomes a net C source. The ecosystem C loss in permafrost regions under net-zero and negative emissions can hinder our efforts in climate change mitigation. Irreversible changes in CH 4  emissions under net-zero and negative emissions The temporal evolution of CH 4  production, oxidation, and CH 4  emission rates is quite similar (fig. S4). As the total production of CH 4  increased, the amount of oxidation of CH 4  to CO 2  and CH 4  released into the atmosphere would have increased. In CLM5, methane production is related to the estimate of heterotrophic respiration corrected by multiple factors associated with the inundated fraction, soil temperature, pH, and redox potential ( 42 ,  43 ). In particular, changes in soil moisture are known to have a critical impact on CH 4  production. Soil drying decreases CH 4  emissions through a reduction of the inundated fraction and a deepening of the water table that reduces anoxia in the non-inundated fraction ( 44 ). On the other hand, larger inundated fractions and a shallow water table lead to an increase in CH 4  emissions due to the use of an anaerobic decomposition pathway, but total C loss may decrease as a result of reduced heterotrophic respiration due to oxygen limitation ( 45 – 47 ). The CH 4  is initially released where heterotrophic respiration occurs, especially in regions with high SOM contents and large inundated fractions ( Figs. 2D  and  3, A and D , and fig. S5). As the climate warms, ground ice melts, and surface water storage increases, the inundated fraction increases primarily in grid cells already partially saturated, which considerably overlap with the region dominated by organic soils ( Figs. 2D  and  3, B and C ). As a result, the increase in CH 4  emissions is concentrated in regions with significant increases in inundated areas and high SOM contents, i.e., in regions where CH 4  emissions are originally high ( Fig. 3, A to F ). Fig. 3. Regional differences in inundated fractions and CH 4  emissions. ( A ) Initial state of the annual mean inundated fractions and ( D ) CH 4  emissions in the permafrost region. ( B  and  C ) Changes in annual mean inundated fractions and ( E  and  F ) CH 4  emissions in the year 2300 relative to year 2000 (B and E) in Exp_zero and (C and F) Exp_neg. ( G ) Time series of the 11-year running mean of annual mean inundated fractions, averaged over the initial permafrost domain with predominantly xorganic and mineral soils. Regions with high organic content (ORG) are defined by an organic matter content of >75 kgC/m 2 , and regions with relatively low organic matter content (MIN) are defined by an organic matter content of <25 kgC/m 2  based on de Vrese and Brovkin ( 49 ). Increased inundated fractions, mainly in organic soils, do not return to the previous state after the onset of net-zero and negative emissions, exhibiting irreversibility ( Fig. 3G ). Most regions with high SOM content overlap with peatland areas (fig. S5), which have low-lying topography that hinders natural runoff drainage. This geomorphological condition likely leads to an irreversible increase in inundation fractions that persists until the end of the simulation ( Fig. 3 ). However, this needs to be verified through further studies. As a result, CH 4  emissions remain relatively high in organic soils with permanently larger inundated fractions despite the decreased heterotrophic respiration ( Fig. 3G  and figs. S3 and S4). In Exp_neg, respiration declines by ~80% from the peak of CO 2  to the year 2197, but CH 4  emissions decrease relatively less by ~63%. These results suggest that under net-zero and negative emissions, the ratio of CH 4  to CO 2  may increase. As a result, the greenhouse gas forcing driven by permafrost degradation could increase due to the high global warming potential of CH 4 , placing additional burden on mitigation efforts ( 44 ,  48 ). Hysteresis of near-surface permafrost and its carbon cycle So far, we showed that the responses of the permafrost and its carbon cycle are not linear and strongly dependent on the pathway of the anthropogenic C emissions and climate conditions. This implies that the permafrost will show strong hysteresis behavior to CO 2  forcing. First of all, the area of near-surface permafrost shows a hysteresis with respect to both CO 2  concentration and SAT ( Fig. 4, A and E ). As the CO 2  concentration decreases, the permafrost area recovers, but it is smaller at the same CO 2  concentration and temperature, compared to the period of increasing CO 2 . In detail, in Exp_neg, the average of permafrost extent during the entire period of decreasing CO 2  is 1.8 × 10 6  km 2  smaller than during the period of increasing CO 2 , despite the colder environment ( Figs. 1B  and  4A ). Even at the same temperature, the permafrost area is much smaller during the decreasing CO 2  period ( Fig. 4E ). The ALT also exhibits a hysteresis similar to that of permafrost extent but to a greater extent ( Fig. 4, B and F ). During the decreasing CO 2  period, in Exp_neg, the ALT is on average ~1.5 times deeper (~3.8 m) than during the increasing CO 2  period. These results suggest that permafrost continues to thaw to a greater depth during the decreasing CO 2  period, which may continue to amplify the decomposability of deep soil C. Fig. 4. Hysteresis of permafrost response to changing CO 2  forcing and SAT. ( A  and  E ) Permafrost area, ( B  and  F ) annual mean ALT, ( C  and  G ) annual mean total ecosystem carbon, and ( D  and  H ) annual CH 4  emissions (A to D) as a function of CO 2  concentrations and (E to H) SAT. Total ecosystem carbon is the sum of vegetation, litter, and soil carbon. All variables except for the permafrost area are averaged over the initial permafrost domain. All values are smoothed by the 11-year moving average. The dot colors indicate each period defined based on the evolution of atmospheric CO 2  concentrations (pink: increasing CO 2  period, orange and blue: decreasing CO 2  period in Exp_zero and Exp_neg, black: restoring period in Exp_neg). Eliseev  et al.  ( 30 ) showed that the slow recovery of permafrost in the cooling phase is related to the thermal inertia of soil water. The increased number of phase transition fronts due to the existence of talik (perennially thawed subsurface soils formed during the warming period) in the cooling phase further enhances the heat inertia of the soil column. The greater the organic carbon density, the greater the porosity and soil water, and thus the higher the thermal capacity in the soil column ( 49 ). In regions with organic-rich soils, the high organic content of soil enhances the thermal inertia and thus exhibits twice slower recovery compared to that in mineral soils (fig. S3). We note that permafrost extent and ALT recover slowly, but these are eventually reversible. Given enough time to adjust, they return to their previous state, as shown by the restoring period in Exp_neg. Total terrestrial ecosystem C in the permafrost region, however, exhibits an open loop with respect to both CO 2  and SAT ( Fig. 4, C and G ), suggesting the irreversible changes at least until the year 2300 under these mitigation pathways ( 50 ). The total ecosystem C increases during the positive emission phase. However, just before the CO 2  concentration starts to decline, the total ecosystem carbon begins to decrease continuously until the end of the simulations. The total cumulative C emissions from permafrost until the end of the simulation are similar between the two scenarios. The changes in CH 4  emissions also show an open loop, with higher emission rates after the cessation of positive emissions, suggesting a possibility of irreversible change ( Fig. 4, D and H ). This hysteresis behavior of the permafrost carbon cycle is observed in regions with organic-rich soils not in mineral soils ( Fig. 4  and fig. S3). These results suggest that the slow recovery of permafrost, due to the thermal inertia of organic soils, contributes to hysteresis in the permafrost carbon cycle. This could create a long-lasting positive feedback to climate system, hindering climate mitigation efforts."
101,discussion,"DISCUSSION In this study, we conducted idealized emission-driven simulations to investigate the response of permafrost under net-zero and negative emission scenarios. After the cessation of positive emissions, permafrost extent and ALT begin to recover but the recovery is slow compared to the rate of temperature decrease due to the thermal inertia of the soil, especially in regions with high SOM content. The total ecosystem C anomaly in the permafrost region is positive during the positive emissions phase due to an increase in vegetation C uptake that outweighs soil respiration. However, after the onset of the net-zero and negative emissions, vegetation C remains stable or decreases, while respiratory C loss from the litter-soil C pool gradually increases, leading to net ecosystem C loss in the permafrost region. This continues until the end of the simulations, ultimately leading to irreversible loss of ecosystem C in permafrost regions. Continued ecosystem C loss after the onset of net-zero and negative emissions could be a potential risk that partially reduces the effectiveness of CDR, thereby inhibiting climate change mitigation. The total amount of ecosystem C loss in the negative emissions scenario is similar to that in the net-zero emissions scenario. This is because vegetation C is reduced due to decreased CO 2  concentrations, and litter-soil C losses continue due to the slow recovery of permafrost under the negative emissions. In addition, even after the negative emissions cease, the AMOC overshoot causes surface warming, leading to further losses of litter-soil C. As a result, achieving negative emissions would not provide the additional benefit of preventing the loss of ecosystem C stored in permafrost. Moreover, there is an irreversible change in CH 4  emissions, with an increase during the net-zero and negative emission phases compared to the positive emission phase. This is because even if the permafrost and ALT partially recover, the increased inundated fractions in organic soils due to permafrost degradation do not return to their original state. In summary, net ecosystem C loss in the permafrost begins after the cessation of positive emissions and continues until the end of the experiment, with the same amount of release of ~14 PgC in both experiments. In addition, CH 4  emissions increase after the cessation of positive emissions, resulting in higher greenhouse gas forcing in the permafrost region. These results suggest that, contrary to our expectations, even if net-zero and negative emissions are achieved, permafrost may pose a considerable risk in efforts to mitigate climate change. Therefore, these changes in permafrost should be considered in long-term climate mitigation policies. At the current state, our projections of permafrost ecosystem C emissions under net-zero and negative emissions contain uncertainties regarding changes in the permafrost and Arctic ecosystem and the AMOC-induced climate change. First, the amount of soil C emissions is uncertain due to poor understanding of decomposition dynamics in deep soils and soil C content, as well as incomplete representation of permafrost processes in the model ( 28 ,  51 ,  52 ). Permafrost soil C pool simulated in CLM5 differs from field-based estimates or site-level observations and is unrealistically high in some grid cells due to the artificial initialization procedure ( 29 ,  31 ,  53 ). In addition, the physical mixing of soil C by cryoturbation is simply represented by a diffusion equation proportional to the vertical gradient of soil C (see Materials and Methods). Therefore, during the positive emission period, high SOM gradient caused by increased litter fall could have potentially led to unnaturally fast rates of carbon burial into deep soil layers. An abrupt thawing in ice-rich permafrost, formation of thermokarst bog, impact of wildfires on permafrost thaw, and their impacts on soil C are not represented here, which may lead to considerable underestimation of future permafrost soil C loss ( 46 ,  54 – 58 ). In addition, CH 4  emissions and their sensitivity to climate change are still uncertain due to the complexity of processes related to CH 4  biogeochemistry and interaction with soil moisture ( 42 ,  44 ). Second, many processes related to Arctic ecosystems are still poorly represented: simple vegetation community and static vegetation composition ( 28 ,  43 ,  59 ). This may underestimate future C uptake by plants and also neglect the inertia effect of vegetation under net-zero or negative emissions. Last, although most ESMs simulate similar behavior of the AMOC in overshoot scenarios or CO 2  ramp-up and ramp-down experiments, CESM2 shows a relatively strong decline and recovery of the AMOC ( 10 ,  31 ,  34 ). This could lead to relatively strong temperature fluctuations in the Northern Hemisphere, with potentially distinctive impacts on permafrost and ecosystem processes. Therefore, there is a need for more accurate reestimation of changes in permafrost ecosystem C in the future through the improvement of model processes. In addition, it is important to assess the range of uncertainty in a multimodel framework, with efforts to include permafrost processes in other ESMs, and to consider this in long-term climate mitigation strategies."
102,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Model configuration In this study, we used the CESM2, which comprises the atmosphere (The Community Atmosphere Model version 6), ocean (The Parallel Ocean Program version 2), sea ice (The Community Ice CodE version 5), and land models (CLM5) ( 35 ). CLM5 is capable of simulating the key thermal, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes associated with permafrost and their response to climate warming ( 60 ). CLM5 has improved its components, such as soil layer resolution, vertically resolved soil biogeochemistry, soil hydrology in cold regions, and snow density and insulation for a more realistic simulation of active layer dynamics, permafrost distribution, and hydrology ( 60 ). In permafrost-affected soils, the vertical mixing of soil C is accomplished by the cryoturbation scheme proposed by Koven  et al.  ( 61 ), which uses a simple diffusion equation ∂ C i ∂ t = D ∂ 2 C i ∂ z 2 where  C i  is the  C  concentration of  C  pool  i , and D is the cryoturbation diffusive parameter (10 −3 m 2 y −1 ), which yields a mixing timescale of approximately 1000 years over the top meter of soil. The diffusivity parameter,  D , is constant within the active layer but tapers linearly to zero at a depth of three times the ALT. This cryoturbation scheme allows soil C, generated near the surface, to move downward into deeper soil layers, leading to better agreement with estimates of high-latitude soil C stocks, where substantial amounts of carbon are found in permafrost regions, stored to depths of 3 m ( 61 ,  62 ). The CLM5 also includes a methane biogeochemical model, which represents a complex and interacting series of processes to simulate net surface CH 4  emissions: the production of CH 4  in anaerobic conditions, oxidation within the soil column, aerenchyma transport, ebullition, aqueous and gaseous diffusion, and fractional inundation ( 42 – 44 ). Because CLM5 does not specifically simulate the wetland fraction or related soil biogeochemical processes, heterotrophic respiration is used to estimate the wetland decomposition rate. In each grid cell, the equations for CH 4  and O 2  are solved separately for the inundated and non-inundated fractions. Inundation fraction is calculated using water table depth and microtopographic distribution, normally distributed around the grid cell mean elevation. We note that changes in CH 4  emissions do not account for changes in wetland or lake distribution that could occur due to thermokarst formation or other thaw-related landscape dynamics ( 42 ,  46 ,  54 ). We also note that the CLM5 does not include dynamic vegetation biogeography, and vegetation distributions are prescribed and held at the present-day condition (year 2000) ( 43 ). Experimental design To avoid discontinuity, we designed two idealized emission pathways, assuming a gradual reduction of emissions through the continuous development of CDR technology. They are subdivided based on whether net-zero (Exp_zero) or negative emissions (Exp_neg) are implemented immediately after the positive emissions ( Fig. 1A  and table S1). In both experiments, anthropogenic CO 2  emissions increase linearly from 2000 to 2050, based on the SSP5-8.5 scenario (1.09 GtCO 2  increase per year), and then decrease at the same rate until 2123 (~1500 PgC of total cumulative emissions). Thereafter, in Exp_zero, net anthropogenic CO 2  emissions are held at zero until the end of the simulation (year 2300), whereas in Exp_neg, CO 2  emissions gradually decline at the same rate until the global mean surface atmospheric CO 2  concentration recovers to its initial value (~383 ppm; until year 2197): ~800 PgC of cumulative artificial CO 2  removal is required. Immediately after the initial recovery of CO 2  concentrations, net-zero emissions are maintained in Exp_neg until the end of the simulation. On the basis of these scenarios, we performed simulations in emission-driven mode. Atmospheric CO 2  concentrations are determined not only by prescribed anthropogenic CO 2  emissions but also by terrestrial and oceanic CO 2  fluxes, thereby reflecting changes in CO 2  concentration through the carbon cycle-climate feedback. In Exp_zero, the atmospheric CO 2  level peaks decades before the onset of net-zero emissions (year 2107) when anthropogenic emissions become equal to natural C uptake and then begin to gradually decline due to continuous natural C uptake ( 10 ,  63 ). For a detailed discussion of the evolution of CO 2  concentrations during the negative emission phases, we refer to Park  et al.  ( 41 ). Here, we focus only on the permafrost response to net-zero and negative emissions. All non-CO 2  conditions, such as land use and non-CO 2  greenhouse gas forcings, are kept at the present-day (2000) level. We have run a total of seven ensemble members with slightly different initial conditions for each experiment."

104,introduction,"Introduction The Gulf Stream (GS) and its extension are pivotal in modulating the Earth’s climate patterns and sustaining the ecological systems 1 – 4 . They act as both a western boundary current (WBC) system for the wind-driven North Atlantic subtropical gyre 5  and a key component of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) 6 . The Gulf Stream region (GSR), defined here as the domain spanning 40°–80°W and 25°–45°N, is distinguished by one of the most energetic eddy fields in the world oceans (Fig.  1a ). The term eddies here is used to describe not only strong meanders of the main current but nonlinear, isolated structures that rotate at a faster rate than they move, thereby enabling them to transport water and other properties over long distances 7 , 8 . Examples of such structures include the large, deep-reaching warm-core rings and cold-core rings that are best known for the GS system 9 , 10 . Recent studies have suggested that the interaction between oceanic eddies and the atmosphere at mesoscales in WBCs is essential to the dynamics and variability of both ocean and atmosphere circulation 11 – 13 . In particular, the interaction between eddies and hurricanes has been revealed to exert a large impact on the Kuroshio transport 14 . Whether a similar process plays a role in the GSR is of great interest, but remains unclear. Fig. 1 Climatological distribution of oceanic eddy energy and hurricane power dissipation index (PDI). a  Distribution of the mean eddy’s surface available potential energy (SAPE) (J) in a logarithmic scale in the North Atlantic for 1993–2021.  b  Distribution of the total hurricane PDI (m 3  s −2 ) in a logarithmic scale in the North Atlantic for 1970–2021.  c  Hurricane PDI (10 10  m 3  s −2 ) in the entire basin (blue) and in the mid-latitudes (orange) of the North Atlantic, with a 3-year running mean smoothing applied. Dashed lines denote the linear trends in a 95% confidence interval. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. In the North Atlantic, strong hurricanes are not rarely seen in the mid-latitude 15 . Probably due to the generally warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) compared with other ocean basins, hurricanes in this region attain their lifetime maximum intensity as far north as 30°N (ref.  16 ). Regarding the overall hurricane activity, as measured by power dissipation index (PDI) 17 , the high-value area extends northwards from low latitudes till across the edge of GSR (Fig.  1b ). During hurricane seasons, oceanic eddies routinely encounter intense hurricanes, and eddy-hurricane interactions ensue 18 . While considerable evidence from models and observations indicates that preexisting oceanic eddies affect hurricane evolution by regulating the upper ocean thermal response 18 – 21 , the general response of the eddy field to hurricanes remains largely uninvestigated. The impact of hurricanes on oceanic mesoscale eddies can occur through two distinct pathways: direct and indirect. The direct influence of hurricanes on eddies acts through two primary mechanisms 14 . Firstly, hurricane-induced strong surface currents have the potential to perturb the eddies out of geostrophic balance, subsequently resulting in the radiation of energy from the eddies in the form of gravity waves at the inertial frequency 22 . The eddies thus exhibited an accelerated decay rate above the background mean level. In addition to the aforementioned process, which results in a similar response in cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, another mechanism can generate contrasting outcomes in these two types of eddies. Through the action of mesoscale cyclonic circulating winds or the Ekman pumping effect, hurricanes contribute positive vorticity in the form of mesoscale eddies to an eddying ocean (see Methods). This reinforces the cyclonic eddies and simultaneously weakens the anticyclonic ones 14 , 23 , 24 . Furthermore, the process of intense hurricane-induced mixing near the ocean surface results in the formation of a prominent cold wake behind hurricanes 25 , 26 . This phenomenon operates in a similar manner to the hurricane-vorticity mechanism, facilitating the formation of new cyclonic eddies, the intensification of existing cyclonic eddies, or the weakening of existing anticyclonic eddies. Indirectly, it is evident that hurricanes have the capacity to induce remarkable disruptions and long-lasting as well as far-reaching perturbations of the GS 27 – 30 . Given that GS serves as the primary energy source of mesoscale eddies through barotropic/baroclinic instability processes 31 , 32 , these hurricane-induced perturbations can naturally exert an impact on the formation and evolution of the eddy field. This hurricane-GS-eddy pathway is non-local and indirect, which allows for the long-term and widespread retention of hurricane climate signals in the ocean. As a response to the elevated level of atmospheric CO 2  in recent decades 17 , 33 , 34 , both hurricanes in the mid-latitude North Atlantic and further south have demonstrated increasing trends ( p  < 0.05) (Fig.  1c ). Furthermore, recent research indicates that intense hurricanes are migrating towards the polar regions 16 . These changes are likely to enhance hurricanes’ role in modulating eddies over the GSR, which may, in return, affect the dynamics of the GS system and the AMOC. Prior to investigating this, it is first necessary to determine how the variations associated with hurricane activity induce changes in the underlying eddy field. In this study, we employed North Atlantic hurricane records from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS, v4r00) 35 , 36 , which date back to 1850. To investigate eddy responses to hurricanes, we utilized a recently published global Mesoscale Eddy Trajectory Atlas (META3.2 DT two-sat) 37 , derived from satellite-obtained altimetry maps for the past 30 years (1993–2021). The atlas documents the trajectories and properties of eddies that were identified based on a set of pre-established criteria, including shapes and amplitudes. Besides, the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5) 38  and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 39  datasets were used to assess the impact of wind and surface buoyancy flux. The RAPID-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array-Western Boundary Time Series (RAPID-MOCHA-WBTS) 40  at 26.5°N, from 2004 to present, was used to examine possible roles of the AMOC and the GS. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index 41  was also employed to assess the potential relation between the large-scale atmospheric variability to the eddy field. By revealing the uniqueness of the eddy response to the vorticity forcing of hurricanes, we find that hurricanes’ effects on the eddy field of GSR are strong not only during hurricane seasons, but last for an extended period afterward. The variation of the annual mean eddy field over the past 30 years exhibits a high correlation with the hurricane PDI, thereby indicating that the latter plays an important role."
105,results,"Results Eddy’s short response to hurricane forcing The aforementioned direct effects of hurricanes on eddies have been verified by observational and modeling studies 42 – 44 , but mostly carried out in the western North Pacific 14 , 23 , 24 . In the North Atlantic basin, we first identified two examples of eddy response from the sea level anomaly (SLA) field to Hurricane Hortense in September 1996 (Supplementary Fig.  1 ) and Hurricane Irma in September 2017 (Supplementary Fig.  2 ), which exhibit the strengthening of cyclonic eddies and weakening of anticyclonic eddies under the hurricane forcing. Furthermore, we performed a statistical analysis of the eddy properties immediately following their interaction with hurricanes over the past 30 years. Figure  2  depicts the mean eddy energy changing rate, averaged over a 15-day period following the hurricane-eddy encounter, in the coordinate centered on hurricanes (see Methods). Eddy responses were examined across three categories of hurricanes: tropical depression-tropical storm (TD-TS), categories 1–2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale (abbreviated as Cat 1–2), and categories 3–5 (abbreviated as Cat 3–5). In general, the responses of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies exhibit significant differences, though both reach their peak intensity near the hurricane’s center and gradually weaken outwards (Fig.  2 ). At approximately  r  = 500 km, hurricanes’ effects gradually diminish. This finding is consistent with the distance of hurricanes from the GS when they had an impact 28 , and is likely related to the extent of hurricane winds. Fig. 2 Radial distribution of eddy energy changing rate within 15 days after hurricanes’ passage. a  Mean energy changing rate of cyclonic eddy (10 5  W),  b  mean energy changing rate of anticyclonic eddy (10 5  W) in the North Atlantic Ocean from 1993 to 2021. Blue circle: tropical depression-tropical storm (TD-TS), green square: categories 1–2 hurricanes (Cat 1–2), and orange triangle: categories 3–5 hurricanes (Cat 3–5). The black dashed lines denote the 0 value. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Specifically, cyclonic eddies near the storm’s center display contrasting behaviors at varying wind speeds, which are dependent on the comparative strengths of the wave-radiation-induced decaying effect and the hurricane-vorticity/mixing-induced strengthening effect. Under the forcing of TD-TS wind, cyclonic eddies undergo marked decay. As the wind gets stronger, the vorticity injection by hurricanes becomes more pronounced, thereby causing cyclonic eddies to intensify with a positive energy-changing rate, particularly in the core area (green, orange line of Fig.  2a ). For hurricanes of Cat 3–5, the eddy energy growth rate can be up to three to four times greater than that under Cat 1–2 hurricanes. For anticyclonic eddies, the combined effect of the two mechanisms results in a considerable reduction in eddy energy. The magnitude of the energy-changing rate first declines sharply with distance from storm centers, and then gradually approaches the background dissipation level further away at  r  ~1000 km (Fig.  2b ). Similar to cyclonic eddies, the energy-changing rate in anticyclonic eddies is significantly amplified under high wind speeds. Additionally, the hurricane’s wind stress curl changes from positive to negative at the storm’s outer edge, thereby acting to enhance anticyclones. In conjunction with the weakening effect of the wave-radiation-induced decay mechanism, the decay rate is effectively zero near  r  = 400 km (orange line of Fig.  2b ). Our findings demonstrate the two opposing effects of hurricanes on eddies in the North Atlantic Ocean. Under intense hurricanes, the hurricane-vorticity mechanism exerts a predominant influence on eddy-hurricane interactions, with a magnitude significantly greater than that under low wind speeds. Also, it manifests as opposite changes in the energy of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, resulting in the strengthening of cyclonic eddies and the weakening of anticyclonic ones. Furthermore, although the GS exhibits disparate dynamical features before and after its separation from the coast, which occurs around 30°N, the eddy responses to hurricanes in the two subregions demonstrate a high degree of consistency with those in Fig.  2  (Supplementary Figs.  3 ,  4 ). Aside from hurricanes, a number of factors may affect eddies, even during the hurricane season. To have a general idea of hurricanes’ significance, we then focused on year-by-year response of the eddy field in a 15-day period following the passage of hurricanes, and compared it with hurricane intensity (see Methods). Figure  3a  illustrates a strong correlation between the mean energy changing rate difference between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, and the PDI, with a correlation coefficient of 0.71 in a 95% confidence interval over the past 30 years. This is consistent with the multi-year mean result of the previous section, highlighting the distinctive influence of intense hurricanes in strengthening cyclonic eddies while weakening anticyclonic eddies (Fig.  2 ). More importantly, the mean eddy energy difference shows a close correlation with the hurricane PDI ( R  > 0.8,  p  < 0.05), undergoing substantial changes of a comparable magnitude to that of the hurricane PDI (Fig.  3b ). This suggests that, among the various forces at play, hurricane forcing significantly impacts the eddy field during hurricane seasons, resulting in substantial alterations. Fig. 3 Comparison between hurricane intensity and the response of the eddy field within 15 days after hurricanes’ passage. a  Mean energy changing rate difference between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (10 6  W, orange) within 15 days after hurricanes’ passage in the Gulf Stream region (GSR), and power dissipation index (PDI) of hurricane in the GSR (10 10  m 3  s −2 , blue) from 1993 to 2021.  b  Same as  a  but for the mean energy difference (10 12  J, orange) between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. A 3-year running mean smoothing was applied to all the time series. The correlation coefficients R (lower-left corner) are shown in each panel. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. It is noteworthy that our analyses of the short-term responses (15 days) of the eddies, as illustrated in Figs.  2 ,  3 , were conducted exclusively on preexisting eddies that were already present prior to the passage of hurricanes. Therefore, the results do not include eddies that were created by the GS after hurricane disturbances. Consequently, it is not possible to discern the impact of the indirect hurricane-GS-eddy mechanism from these short-term responses. Nevertheless, the impact of the hurricane-mixing mechanism has been incorporated. Hurricanes’ impact on the long-term variation of eddy fields Whether the imprint of hurricanes on the underlying eddy field can last long in the ocean depends on many factors, including the characteristics of the eddies themselves. Globally, the lifetime of mid-latitude eddies between 20° and 40° latitude is a function of both their horizontal scale and amplitude. Eddies with smaller amplitudes or smaller horizontal scales have shorter lifespans, whereas those with larger amplitudes or greater horizontal scales typically persist for longer periods of time. Moreover, eddies in the GSR and the Kuroshio Extension are the most energetic in the ocean, contributing to the generally longer lifespan of eddies in these two regions 45 . The energy of the eddy field in the GSR is predominantly governed by large eddies, which can live for up to 120 days or longer. In contrast, eddies with smaller horizontal scales and lower energies tend to dissipate quickly, losing the signature of hurricane forcing (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Therefore, the impact of hurricanes is likely to persist over time by large eddies, leaving a long-lasting imprint in the ocean. In light of this hypothesis, an examination was conducted of the annual mean energy of large eddies in the GSR. In recent decades, the energy of large cyclonic eddies has exhibited a multi-decadal V-shaped variation, characterized by a substantial decline until approximately 2010, followed by a large increase thereafter. Meanwhile, the energy of the large anticyclonic eddies has displayed an inverse A-shaped structure (Fig.  4a ). These two contrasting multi-decadal changes are indicative of the effects of hurricanes. In particular, the hurricane PDI has exhibited pronounced variations on interannual to multi-decadal time scales, including a notable lull around 2010, followed by a rapid and substantial fourfold increase within a few years (Fig.  1c  and Fig.  4b ). With regard to eddies, the energy difference between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies is significantly correlated with PDI variations ( R  > 0.7,  p  < 0.05) within a 95% confidence interval. Similarly, the eddies’ total surface relative vorticity exhibits a strong correlation (( R  > 0.7,  p  < 0.05, Fig.  4b ). In conjunction with the direct impact of hurricanes as identified from the short-term response of the eddy field, these results provide compiling evidence that hurricanes are one probable cause of long-term variations in the eddy field of the GSR. Fig. 4 Variation of annual mean eddy energy of large eddies and power dissipation index (PDI) in the Gulf Stream region (GSR). a  Cyclonic eddy energy (blue) and anticyclonic eddy energy (orange),  b  PDI (black), the energy difference between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (blue), and the total surface relative vorticity of the eddy field (orange) in the GSR from 1993 to 2021. All quantities are normalized by their own mean values. A 3-year running mean smoothing was applied to all the time series. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. It is also important to note that the hurricane is not the sole factor affecting the eddy field. In particular, around 2010, when hurricane activity is at its lowest level, the energy difference of the eddy field varies out of phase with the hurricane PDI (Fig.  4b ), indicating the presence of alternative forces. Among the potential factors, the local wind stress curl and the local buoyancy flux within the GSR can be excluded as possible causes, as both of their variation patterns show minimal resemblance to that of the eddy field (Fig.  5a, b ). With respect to the large-scale oceanic features, the GS transport, monitored at 26.5°N by the RAPID project, exhibits a high degree of similarity to the eddies (Fig.  5c ), with a correlation exceeding 0.7 at a lead of approximately one year. The strength of the AMOC, as observed at 26.5°N, shows a notable decline prior to 2010 and subsequent recovery 46  (Fig.  5c ). However, its correlation with the eddy field is relatively weak, likely due to the abrupt nature of the change. Moreover, there is evidence indicating a connection between the winter-time NAO index and the eddies of GS 47 , 48 . Indeed, the time series of the winter-time NAO index exhibits a strong resemblance to that of the eddy field (Fig.  5d ), with a correlation exceeding 0.7 at an approximately 2-year lead. These factors- the GS, the AMOC, and the large-scale climate oscillation pattern denoted by the winter-time NAO index-may all have contributed to the observed variation of the energy difference between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. However, their respective forcing mechanisms remain uncertain.

106,discussion,"Discussion Isolated mesoscale eddies are capable of transporting mass and climatically important tracers over considerable distances 7 , 8 . They are, therefore, considered to play a pivotal role in the global climate system. The processes regulating the properties of the eddy field are of great importance in this regard; however, identifying these processes is a formidable task, particularly given the multitude of potential factors that could influence the eddy field 47 , 48 . Furthermore, the relationships between eddies and some forcing factors are likely mutual, thereby further complicating the task of identifying causality. For example, it’s evident that the GS has a strong influence on the eddy field. Meanwhile, beneath the upper layer of GS, the deep western boundary current (DWBC) passes through and crosses with the GS near Cape Hatteras. Previous research has indicated that the eddy fluxes of potential vorticity can entrain the upper DWBC under the GS, consequently altering the path of the GS 49 , 50 . This, in turn, can influence the characteristics of the GS. In view of the above, the forcing mechanism identified in the present study represents a notable advancement in our understanding of the subject matter. The short-term response analysis demonstrated that the hurricane-vorticity and hurricane-mixing mechanism can effectively strengthen cyclonic eddies while simultaneously weakening anticyclonic ones. This distinctive impact, namely, the opposite response of the two kinds of eddies, provides an essential tool for evaluating the role of not only hurricanes but other possible factors in the long-term behavior of the eddy field of the GSR. Furthermore, the knowledge of the inclination of hurricanes to inject positive vorticity into the ocean provides insight into their potential impacts on large-scale ocean circulations and climate, which merits further investigation in the future."

109,introduction,"Introduction Originating as waters from the Gulf of Mexico Loop Current that enter the western Straits of Florida, the Florida Current (FC) is constrained by the relatively shallow bathymetry ( < 800-m depth) between the Florida Peninsula, Cuba, and the Bahamas before entering the open North Atlantic and becoming the Gulf Stream. This strong, upper-ocean flow, where the surface currents can reach velocities of 2 m s −1 1 , represents the beginning of and the swiftest part of the Gulf Stream System. The FC carries approximately 32 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6  m 3  s −1 ) of warm and salty tropical waters northward and plays an important role in the regional and global climate systems 2 , 3 . Bolstered by western boundary intensification, the FC provides most of the northward volume and heat transport in the subtropical North Atlantic and accounts for the bulk of both the upper limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the western boundary component of the subtropical gyre circulation. Therefore, observing and investigating the variability of the FC is of particular importance for detecting and better understanding changes in the Earth’s climate system, as well as for interpreting regional variations in weather, sea level, and ecosystems. A unique, sustained observing system in the Florida Straits, consisting of voltage measurements recorded from a submarine telecommunication cable installed between Florida and Grand Bahama Island, paired with regular ship surveys in the Florida Straits at 27°N (Fig.  1 ), was established in 1982 4 – 8 . Voltage perturbations induced on the cable by the varying FC flow through the Earth’s magnetic field (EMF; henceforth, used interchangeably with the geomagnetic field) are calibrated and processed into volume transport estimates using transports calculated from ship section data, collected with Pegasus floats in 1982–1988 5 , 6 , 9 , with free-falling dropsonde floats since 1991 10 , and with Lowered and Shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (LADCP and SADCP) since 2001 8 . Since 2000, this observing system has been maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), in Miami, Florida, as part of the Western Boundary Time Series (WBTS) program. As of now, the cable measurements have provided nearly 40 years of quasi-continuous, daily estimates of the FC volume transport. Beginning in 2004, WBTS partnered with the Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) and Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array (MOCHA) programs, linking the Florida Straits WBTS cable recording system with RAPID/MOCHA tall moorings deployed between the Bahamas and Africa at about 26.5°N. The resulting RAPID-MOCHA-WBTS array (henceforth RAPID array) is the oldest trans-basin AMOC observing array in existence (e.g. 11 ,). Fig. 1 The Western Boundary Time Series observing network in the Straits of Florida. The network consists of the submarine telecommunications cable between West Palm Beach and Grand Bahama Island (cyan curve), ship sections across the Florida Current (FC) at 27°N with in situ measurements at nine stations (white circles), two bottom pressure gauges on both sides of the FC at 27°N (yellow stars), and along-track satellite altimetry measurements (magenta dotted line). CTD Conductivity-Temperature-Depth, LADCP Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, XBT expendable bathythermograph. The AMOC is the principal driver for oceanic meridional heat transport in the subtropical North Atlantic 12 . Most climate models that contributed simulations to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) suggest a decline of the AMOC by 34–45% of its present-day strength towards the end of the 21 st  century 13 . A variety of published proxy records indicate that the AMOC may already be slowing down on a centennial time scale 14 – 17 . Some proxy-based conclusions, however, have lately been criticized, as being based only on a subset of proxy records 18 . The ability of temperature-based indices to represent the AMOC has also been questioned 19 . In addition, it has recently been shown that the observed reduction in sea surface temperatures in the subpolar North Atlantic (also known as the warming hole), often assumed to be an indication of the AMOC slowdown, could largely be driven by the atmosphere alone without any changes in ocean circulation 20 . Direct observations at the RAPID array have shown that the AMOC was in a state of reduced overturning in 2008 and 2016 as compared to the 2004–2008 period 21 . On the other hand, the AMOC transport time series shows a small, but not statistically significant, increase between 2009 and 2018 22 . Similarly, direct measurements obtained from repeat sections across the Gulf Stream, between New Jersey and Bermuda (beginning in 1992), do not support suggestions that the AMOC has started slowing down substantially 23 – 25 , and no significant weakening of the AMOC has been detected in reconstructions based on sparse hydrographic section data 26 – 28 . It is possible that the AMOC time series derived from direct measurements are still too short, and primarily showcase interannual-to-decadal variations 29 , 30 . If the AMOC is indeed slowing down on a centennial timescale, its upper branch, primarily composed of the FC and the Gulf Stream in the subtropical North Atlantic, may also be weakening 31 , although the trends downstream and upstream of Cape Hatteras can be different 32 . The four-decade long FC transport time series inferred from cable measurements at 27°N represents the longest observational record of a key AMOC component. This record has exhibited a small negative trend of about −0.3 Sv per decade. This trend has been monitored and documented in several State of the Climate reports published as supplements to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (e.g. 33 – 38 ,). Depending on the year of publication, the trend has been deemed either insignificant or marginally significant, therefore, not attracting particular attention. Several recent studies, however, have used the overall trend in the FC transport to conjecture about the possible centennial decline of the Gulf Stream and the AMOC 39 – 41 . The objective of this study is to reassess the record-long change in the FC strength over the four decades of observations. Specifically, we reconsider the processing of voltages measured on the submarine cable that are used to derive the FC volume transport time series. Most importantly, we apply a correction for the secular change in the EMF to the voltage data to derive corrected FC volume transports since 2000. This correction was accounted for in the earlier (1982–1998) part of the cable record 7  but neglected later due to a change in data processing more heavily reliant upon calibration with ship section data. We show that with the increased length of the cable record, explicit consideration of local geomagnetic field variations has become necessary, especially when studying processes on decadal and longer time scales. The analysis of the corrected time series presented herein challenges the previously made assertions on the statistically significant decline of the FC at 27°N 39 , 40 , 42 . Finally, we discuss the implications of the corrected FC time series on the AMOC estimates at the RAPID array."
110,results,"Results Long-term changes in the Florida current strength The daily FC volume transports inferred from cable voltages and estimated from ship section data at 27°N from 1982 to 2023, prior to corrections applied in this study, are presented in Fig.  2 . The cable record is nearly continuous except several gaps that occurred due to operational issues and instrument failures (“Methods”). The cable transport shows a time mean of 31.7 Sv and a standard deviation of 3.4 Sv. The ship sections yield a time mean of 32.3 Sv and a standard deviation of 3.1 Sv. The FC transport variability is dominated by subseasonal (periods less than a year) signals, while the interannual-to-decadal variability is weak, with a standard deviation of less than 1 Sv 3 , 43 , 44 . The 1982–2023 linear trend of the FC volume transport from the cable was −0.4 ± 0.2 Sv per decade (the uncertainty indicates the 95% confidence interval; see Methods). Note that this trend is significant and greater than the trend of about −0.3 Sv per decade reported in earlier studies 33 – 36 , 39 , 40 . The trend became significant relative to the noise as the time series length increased and due to low transports in the most recent 2–3 years of observations now included in the record. During these recent years, the FC transport was about 1.5 Sv lower than the record average 45 . Fig. 2 The Florida Current volume transport. Daily transport estimates from the cable record (black; prior to corrections applied in this study); estimates from the Pegasus (orange diamonds) and Pegasus in dropsonde mode (Pegasus-DM; light blue circles) sections; estimates from the dropsonde sections (blue circles); and estimates from the Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) sections (red circles). The linear trends for 1982–2023, 1982–1998, and 2000–2023 periods are shown by the orange, cyan, and magenta lines, respectively. It is important to note that the negative trend in the time series is only evident in the data after 2000, when cable measurements resumed following a 17-month long (October 1998—March 2000) cessation (“Methods”). Indeed, the 1982–1998 trend of 0.1 ± 0.7 Sv per decade is very small and insignificant, while the 2000–2023 period yields a statistically significant trend of −0.7 ± 0.4 Sv per decade. This observation is consistent with 39 , where it was reported that a significant decline in Gulf Stream transport has only become detectable during the past decade. We note, however, that since the decline can be traced back to the resumption of cable measurements in 2000, it is possible that the observed decline in the FC transport could be due to a change in the data processing procedure (see “Methods” for details) rather than the real oceanic signal. To validate the trends in the cable data, we also estimate the linear trends in the transports estimated from ship section data and from cross-stream satellite altimetry measurements (“Methods”). The trend estimates for different observing platforms and time intervals are presented in Table  1  and in Fig.  3 . The estimates from all ship sections combined in 1982–2023 show a small and statistically insignificant trend of 0.1 ± 0.3 Sv per decade (Fig.  3a ). The same trend (0.1 ± 0.4 Sv per decade) is obtained from all ship sections in 1993–2023. Within the uncertainty bounds, this trend agrees with the altimetry-derived trend of −0.1 ± 0.2 Sv per decade for the 1993–2023 period (Fig.  3b ). It is interesting to note that the altimetry-derived transports for the 2000–2023 period show the same, statistically insignificant negative trend of −0.1 ± 0.3 Sv per decade (cyan line in Fig.  3b ). On the other hand, the transports estimated from the dropsonde, LADCP, and the combination of LADCP and SADCP (LADCP/SADCP) sections in 2000–2023 exhibit positive trends of about 1 Sv per decade, although only the trend obtained from the dropsonde sections (1.1 ± 0.8 Sv per decade) is found to be significantly greater than zero (Fig.  3c ). Both the LADCP and the LADCP/SADCP sections yield insignificant trends of 1.0 ± 1.3 Sv per decade and 0.7 ± 1.1 Sv per decade, respectively (Fig.  3 d,  e ). It should be noted that ship section data is relatively sparse and is biased towards good weather days as no calibration cruises are carried out in adverse weather conditions.

The trends (Sv per decade) are estimated using measurements from different platforms for different time intervals. Fig. 3 The Florida Current volume transport estimates from ship sections and satellite altimetry. Linear trends (red lines) of the Florida Current volume transports estimates (black dots) from ( a ) all ship sections, ( b ) satellite altimetry, ( c ) dropsonde sections, ( d ) lowered acoustic doppler current profiler (LADCP) sections, and ( e ) the combination of Shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (SADCP) and LADCP sections. The cyan line in ( b ) shows the linear trend in 2000–2023. The obtained trends contrast with the overall trend and especially with the 2000–2023 trend determined from the cable data (Fig.  2 ; Table  1 ). To investigate the observed discrepancies between the trends in transports, we compute the concurrent differences between the cable transports and the transports estimated from individual ship sections (dropsonde, LADCP, and LADCP/SADCP) and from satellite altimetry, as well as their trends from 2000 to 2023 (Fig.  4 ). Ideally, if the cable data is well calibrated, we should expect the differences to be spread around the zero line with no or very small trends over the period of observations. Instead, all the differences exhibit negative trends, statistically significant for altimetry and LADCP/SADCP, indicating that the cable transports are consistently becoming lower than the transports inferred from all other observing platforms. This analysis indicates that there is likely an issue with the cable calibration, reasonably assuming that the ship section data yields more reliable transport estimates 8 . The fact that the cable transports are diverging from both the ship-based and altimetry-based transports in 2000–2023 raises a question of whether the statistically significant decline in the FC transport estimated from cable measurements in 2000–2023 (−0.7 ± 0.4 Sv per decade) is a real oceanic signal. Fig. 4 Differences between the concurrent estimates of the Florida Current volume transport. The differences are computed between the transports estimated from cable measurements (prior to corrections applied in this study) and from ( a ) dropsonde sections, ( b ) satellite altimetry measurements, ( c ) Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) sections, and ( d ) the combination of Shipboard and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (SADCP/LADCP) sections. The linear trends of the differences are shown by the red lines. Long-term change in voltages measured on the submarine cable To investigate whether the decline in the FC transport observed in the cable data since 2000 is a real oceanic signal or a spurious drift due to data processing issues, the one-minute voltages measured on the cable in 2000–2023 were analyzed (Fig.  5 ). The voltages depend on the depth-averaged velocity, the vertical component of the EMF, the width of the strait at the cable location, the electrical conductivity of the ocean, and the conductance of sediments and upper conducting crust beneath the ocean (Eq. ( 1 ) in “Methods”; 7). The time-mean voltage in 2000–2023 is about 1.25 V. The voltage record exhibits a decreasing trend, with an overall 2000–2023 voltage reduction of about 0.14 V (black line Fig.  5 ). Fig. 5 One-minute voltage recorded on the submarine cable between Florida and Grand Bahama Island. The linear change in the cable voltage from 2000 to 2023 is ΔV Cable  = −0.14 V (black line). The almost linear change in voltage due to the secular change in the vertical component of the Earth’s magnetic field (EMF) is ΔV EMF  = − 0.12 V (cyan line). Since the conductivity weighting (C w ) and the conductance depth (H e ) in Eq. ( 1 ) (“Methods”) can be considered constant, then the 2000–2023 decrease in voltage is either due to a decreasing FC transport (T FC ) or the vertical component of the EMF (F z ). The EMF is created by the planet’s moving, molten iron core. Therefore, its poles are not stationary but slowly and continuously move over geological time scales. Based on the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model 46 , the north magnetic pole has moved from the Canadian Archipelago towards Russia over the last century, and it is now located about 450 km away from the geographic North Pole. While in the early years of the cable record it was reasonable to assume that F z  was steady 4 , the 1982–1998 cable record was corrected for the secular change in the EMF by multiplying the motion-induced voltages by a factor inversely proportional to the secular change in F z 7 . However, for the reasons mentioned in Methods, the 2000–2023 cable record has not been corrected for the secular change in F z . Using the IGRF model in the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information’s Magnetic Field Calculator ( www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml ), we find that F z  in the Florida Straits (at 27°N, 79.5°W) decreased almost linearly from 3.96 × 10 −5  Tesla (T) in 1999–3.60 × 10 −5  T in 2023, equating to the total reduction of about 3.6 × 10 −6  T (~150 nT per year) or about 9% from the initial value. The decreasing F z  in the Florida Straits leads to decreases in voltages and the amplitude of voltage variations measured by the cable (Eq. ( 1 ) in “Methods”). Assuming that the FC volume transport is constant (T FC  = 32 Sv), the conductivity weighting is 1.06, and the conductance depth is 1050 m 4 , the reduction in F z  would correspond to a voltage reduction of about 0.12 V measured on the cable (cyan line in Fig.  5 ). Thus, it appears that the voltage reduction due to the secular change in the EMF almost fully accounts for the actual voltage decrease measured on the cable in 2000–2023 (0.14 V). Given the calibration factor α = 24.42 Sv V -1 , the voltage reduction of 0.12 V translates to a decrease of ~2.9 Sv in transport. This is a very large number that cannot be neglected, in particular when attributing a relatively small and marginally significant trend in the time series to a real climate signal. Recall that the 2000–2023 trend in the cable record was −0.7 ± 0.4 Sv per decade (Fig.  2 , Table  1 ), which corresponds to a decline of about 1.7 Sv during this time. Corrected estimates of the Florida Current volume transport From the analysis presented above, it is clear that with the increased length of the cable record it has become absolutely necessary to correct the 2000–2023 voltage and/or transport data for the secular change in the EMF. The easiest way to accomplish this would be to apply this correction offline to the estimated transports. However, the adjustments of the offsets β (Eq. ( 2 ) in “Methods”), performed by comparing the cable and ship section data during the times of known problems with the recording system, are likely to have partially compensated for the EMF change. Therefore, we modified the equation used to derive the transports from voltages to explicitly account for the secular change in F z  (Eq. ( 4 ) in “Methods”). We then recalibrated the obtained cable record and readjusted the offsets in problematic time intervals, before finally calculating the new transport estimates (see “Methods” for further details). Displayed in Fig.  6a  are the obtained FC volume transports in 2000–2023 corrected for the secular change in the EMF. The 2000–2023 mean FC transport is 31.8 Sv and the standard deviation is 3.0 Sv. While there are some differences with the earlier record due to the recalibration of the offsets, in particular in 2000–2005, the most significant impact of applying the EMF correction is the elimination of the negative trend in the FC transports. The trend in 2000–2023 changed from −0.7 ± 0.4 Sv per decade in the earlier record to 0.0 ± 0.3 Sv per decade in the new record. When we combined the 2000–2023 cable record corrected for the EMF with the prior 1982–1998 record, we obtained the overall 1982–2023 trend of −0.1 ± 0.2 Sv per decade, i.e., statistically insignificant and four times smaller than for the cable record not corrected for the EMF ( − 0.4 ± 0.2 Sv per decade; Table  1 ). It is interesting to observe that the 1993–2023 trend in the cable record corrected for the EMF (−0.1 ± 0.3 Sv per decade) is the same with the 1993–2023 trend in the altimetry-derived FC transports ( − 0.1 ± 0.2 Sv per decade; Fig.  4b ), and the 2000–2023 trends in the cable and altimetry transports are close within the uncertainty limits (Table  1 ). Fig. 6 Florida Current (FC) volume transports corrected for the secular change in the Earth’s Magnetic Field (EMF). a  The time series of the daily FC volume transport: (blue) not corrected for the secular change in the EMF, (red) corrected for the secular change in the EMF. The linear trends of the FC transport not corrected and corrected for the EMF are shown by the blue and red lines, respectively.  b  The differences between the cable and ship section transport for the cable data (blue squares) not corrected for the EMF and (red circles) corrected for the EMF. The linear trends of the differences (Δ T ) not corrected and corrected for the EMF are shown by the blue and red lines, respectively. To further assess the corrected and recalibrated cable transports, we again consider the differences between the concurrent cable and ship section transports (Fig.  6b ). The time-mean and the RMS of the differences between the old (not corrected for the EMF) cable transports and the ship section transports are −0.3 Sv and 1.9 Sv, respectively. As has already been mentioned, the old cable transports in 2000–2023 were consistently becoming lower relative to the ship section transports. The differences between the old cable and ship section transports exhibit a negative trend of about −0.7 Sv per decade (blue line in Fig.  6b ). In contrast, the difference between the new (corrected for the EMF) cable transports and the ship section transports has no trend (red line in Fig.  6b ), meaning that the calibration of the corrected cable record has improved. Furthermore, the RMS difference between these estimates has reduced to 1.5 Sv. This analysis demonstrates that the newly corrected cable record is more accurate than the old record. Most importantly, by accounting for the secular change in the EMF, we show that the FC volume transport has not declined significantly over the past 40 years of observations, but in fact has remained remarkably stable. Implications for the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation The submarine cable has been a key component of the RAPID AMOC observing array at ~26.5°N since April 2004. Because applying a correction for the secular change in the EMF makes a significant change in the overall trend of the FC transport, the next logical question to address is how the newly corrected FC transport time series affects the AMOC calculation. The AMOC at ~26.5°N is composed of (i) the northward FC transport inferred from cable measurements, (ii) the predominantly northward near-surface meridional Ekman transport, and (iii) the southward upper-midocean transport (between the Bahamas and Africa) down to the deepest northward velocity at ~1100 m. Here, we recalculate the RAPID AMOC time series covering the period from April 2004 to February 2022 using the corrected FC transports and compare them to the previously published RAPID AMOC time series 47 . In the latter time series, the upper limb of the AMOC at ~26.5°N had a mean northward transport of about 16.8 Sv, composed of the mean FC transport of 31.3 Sv, the Ekman transport of 3.7 Sv, and the upper-midocean transport of −18.2 Sv. Observations at the RAPID array showcased that the AMOC was in its strongest state in the first years of observations (2004–2007; blue curve in Fig.  7 ). Then, the AMOC transport decreased abruptly reaching its record low value in 2009–2010. The recovery of the AMOC from the 2009–2010 dip was not complete and a state of reduced overturning persisted until 2017 21 . The negative AMOC tendency between 2004 and 2018 has been widely used in support of a likely AMOC slowdown, suggested by climate models and reconstructions based on ocean proxy data (e.g. 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 ,). The overall 2004–2022 trend in the previously published RAPID time series is −1.3 ± 0.7 Sv per decade (blue curve in Fig.  7 ), thus also supporting the AMOC slowdown. Fig. 7 The northward transport of the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), estimated from measurements collected at the RAPID observing array a ~26.5°N. The seasonal cycle was removed and the residual time series were low-pass filtered using a 2-year cutoff window. The blue curve and blue bold line (red curve and red bold line) show the AMOC time series (linear trend) computed with the Florida Current transport not corrected (corrected) for the secular change in the Earth Magnetic Field (EMF). After the EMF correction is applied, the mean FC transport over the RAPID time interval increases to 31.7 Sv, and the mean AMOC transport increases to 17.1 Sv. The overall AMOC trend becomes −0.8 ± 0.7 Sv per decade, i.e., it is reduced by about 40% and becomes only marginally significant (red curve in Fig.  7 ). With the corrected FC transport, the AMOC is slightly reduced during the first years of the record, but it is increased starting from about 2009, becoming larger by almost 1 Sv compared to the earlier estimate toward the end of the time series. It is interesting to note that, using the revised FC transports, the second maximum in the AMOC time series observed in 2018 (~18.6 Sv) becomes much closer to high transports in 2005–2006 (~19.3 Sv). These findings provide a stronger support for the previously made conclusion that the observed AMOC time series at ~26.5°N showcases an interdecadal variability rather than a long-term decline."
111,discussion,"Discussion There is growing scientific interest in how large-scale ocean circulation is changing or will change in the future in response to anthropogenic forcing. Particular attention is paid to the potential decline of the AMOC, fueled by the results based on state-of-the-art climate models and proxy data reconstructions. Although solid observational evidence is still lacking as direct observations of the AMOC are very short compared to climate time scales, some studies have used relatively small and often marginally significant trends in observational data as support for the notion of AMOC slowdown or even collapse (e.g. 14 , 15 , 17 ,). Some conclusions based on observational products are oftentimes made without detailed consideration of how the raw data were processed. Arguments about the robustness of tendencies in observational data products usually rely only on statistical significance 39 – 41 . Yet, it is important to realize that an inherent nature of observational records is that they may be subject to spurious drifts and biases, caused by instrumentation and data processing issues. As a result, routine calibration, re-evaluation, and correction of observational data records, sometimes years after the initial data were released, is an integral and inevitable part of any long-term observational program. Therefore, small and marginally significant (in statistical sense) tendencies in data products should be treated with caution in any analysis of long-term changes. In this study, we reassessed the 40-year record of the FC volume transport inferred from motion-induced voltages measured on submarine telecommunication cables in the Florida Straits since 1982. The cable record constitutes the longest observational record of a boundary current in existence. Therefore, these cable observations together with regular cable calibration cruises that directly measure the FC volume transport and water mass properties provide a unique and invaluable dataset to study climate variability in the North Atlantic on decadal time scales. Because the FC is the major contributor to the northward transport of both the upper-limb of the AMOC and the subtropical gyre circulation in the North Atlantic, it is reasonable to expect that on sufficiently long time scales a FC decline could indicate a slowdown in the AMOC and/or the gyre circulation. It should also be recalled that not all the western boundary flow is contained in the FC. A small, but highly variable, part of this flow is carried by the Antilles Current 48 . The long history of cable measurements in the Florida Straits involved contributions from several generations of scientists. This has resulted in some differences in the processing methods of raw voltage data during the 1982–1998 and 2000–2023 periods (“Methods”). In addition, the use of different recording systems over time and recurrent instrument failures made it necessary to correct the cable voltages and inferred transports for spurious offsets using direct measurements of the FC transport carried out by ship surveys. After investigating the differences in data processing during the two cable epochs (1982–1998 and 2000–2023), we focused our attention on the impact of secular changes in the geomagnetic field on motion-induced voltages measured by the cable, which the earlier part of the record was explicitly corrected for. While we could not re-examine the 1982–1998 raw voltage record as part of it had been lost 3 , the small negative trend in the FC transport record is associated only with the 2000–2023 portion of the time series. The 1982–1998 transports have no meaningful trend. Since 2000, high-frequency geomagnetic signals have been effectively removed by applying a 3-day low-pass filter to the cable record. However, during this second epoch, the direct correction for the secular change in the geomagnetic field had previously not been done. In our analysis, we find that the observed decrease in voltages over the 2000–2023 period is almost fully accounted for by the secular change in the local EMF. Therefore, as the length of the cable record continues to grow, correcting it for secular EMF changes is crucial. The 2000–2023 cable record was reprocessed by first correcting the cable voltages for the secular change in the EMF and then recalibrating the FC transports using ship section data. The corrected FC transport time series is made freely available through the WBTS project’s web page ( https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/wbts/ ). The most important outcome of this study is that the overall trend of the FC volume transport since 1982 has been revised. The updated trend estimate for the 1982–2023 period is −0.1 ± 0.2 Sv per decade, which is not statistically different from zero and 3–4 times smaller than it was thought previously before accounting for the EMF change. This result impacts the recently made assertion of the robust weakening of the FC 39 . Rather, it appears that the FC has remained remarkably stable over the 40 years of nearly continuous observations. Furthermore, the change in the FC cable transports necessitates a revision in the AMOC transports at ~26.5°N since 2004 derived from the RAPID array. The use of the corrected FC transport time series reduces the negative trend in the AMOC from 2004 to 2022 by about 40% and makes it only marginally significant in statistical sense. The results of this study indicate that, if climate models are correct that the AMOC is slowing or will soon slow down, this slowdown has not yet been reflected in the FC and the AMOC transports, or the observational records are still too short to detect it with confidence. This is in accord with other observation-based studies 23 – 28 . Nevertheless, the likelihood of a future AMOC slowdown and the importance of both the FC and the AMOC in the regional and global climate variability emphasizes the value of sustained observations in the Florida Straits and in the subtropical North Atlantic at ~26.5°N. The existing records are just starting to resolve decadal-scale signals relevant to climate variability. Continued observations are thus necessary for detection and mechanistic understanding of climate-related changes and for validating and improving ocean and climate models."

113,intro,"1 Introduction Nitrogen input caused by human activities can greatly affect the processes of the N-cycling of lake ecosystems, leading to the eutrophication of water bodies ( Basu et al., 2022 ;  Jiang et al., 2023 ). It has been proved microorganisms, especially N-cycling functional genes are the key driver of the nitrogen transformation processes in the lakes ( Isobe and Ohte, 2014 ). Therefore, N-cycling functional genes have been given more and more concerns for nitrogen removal of the eutrophic lakes. N-cycling plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of lakes ( Isobe and Ohte, 2014 ). Nitrogen in lakes exists in the form of inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen, which is absorbed and assimilated by algae, macrophytes ( Wu et al., 2021 ), benthic animals and other organisms ( Wu Y. et al., 2022 ), and can be converted into biological organic nitrogen ( Pajares et al., 2017 ). After these organisms die, they release a large amount of organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen to water and sediments ( Li et al., 2012 ;  Wu et al., 2021 ). In eutrophic lakes, the microbial decomposition of a large number of dead aquatic organisms settling to the bottom of the lakes can cause a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen ( Wu et al., 2021 ), which will lead to the production of ammonia, sulfide and other substances ( Hu et al., 2023 ), having a negative impact on the lake ecosystem health ( Wang M. et al., 2023 ;  Wang X. et al., 2023 ). The N-cycling processes in sediments mainly involve in nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA) and anammox ( Hu et al., 2023 ), among which nitrification and denitrification are the most important nitrogen transformation processes. These processes induced by microorganisms can oxidize ammonia nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen, and reduce the bound nitrogen into N 2 O or N 2  back to the atmosphere ( Broman et al., 2021 ). Each pathway of the N-cycling process is completed by the enzyme encoded by the corresponding functional gene using the corresponding substrate catalysis ( Broman et al., 2021 ). However, the abundance and diversity of N-cycling functional genes in lake ecosystems are greatly different due to different water quality (such as water temperature, and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio) ( Basu et al., 2022 ), hydrological conditions (such as lake water exchange cycle) ( Stoliker et al., 2016 ;  Li et al., 2021 ) and seasons ( Baumann et al., 2022 ). Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the changes of N-cycling functional genes in lakes and their influencing factors in different seasons. Baiyangdian (BYD) Lake (38°43′ ~ 39°02′N, 115°38′ ~ 116°07′E) is the typical eutrophic wetland in North China and has a relatively important geographic position. The BYD Lake water is eutrophicated, accounting for 26.7% of areas “mildly eutrophicated,” accounting for 53.3% of areas “moderately eutrophicated,” and accounting for 20.0% of areas “severely eutrophicated” ( Liu et al., 2020 ;  Yao et al., 2023 ). However, serious eutrophication dominated by seasonal nitrogen and phosphorus pollution occurred due to intense agricultural activities and rural domestic sewage discharge in BYD Lake ( Zhao et al., 2011 ;  Cai et al., 2021 ). Because of the strong exchange between water and surface sediments in shallow lakes, eutrophication might affect the nitrogen cycle in sediments ( Shi et al., 2022 ). The primary objectives of this work were: (1) the key functional genes related to N-cycling have seasonal variability in sediments in the BYD Lake; and (2) some environmental factors can play a key role in regulating the N-cycling process."
114,discussion,"4 Discussion It is well known that many N-cycling processes are mediated by N-related microorganisms ( Isobe and Ohte, 2014 ). The nitrification and denitrification functional gene abundance could be an indicator of nitrification and denitrification activities, which has been demonstrated by previous studies reporting a positive correlation between them ( Jiang et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the synergistic effect is manifested in a positive correlation of their gene abundance because nitrification can provide sufficient nitrate for denitrification ( Jiang et al., 2023 ). In the current study, a strong correlation was also observed between the abundance of functional genes associated with denitrification (e.g.,  nirK, nirS,  and  norB ) and nitrification (e.g.,  amoA, amoB  and  hao ) pathway in spring, fall and winter ( p <  0.05). In summer, the supply of nitrate is limited due to higher temperatures and excessive consumption of oxygen by algae and aquatic plants ( Zhou et al., 2021 ), which may be the reason why we did not observe the correlation between functional genes related to nitrification and denitrification processes in summer. The different responses of the N cycling process to external stresses might be driven by the remodeling of the microbial community, which could be strongly affected by changes in physical–chemical properties ( Tan et al., 2022 ). A previous study has shown that denitrification and DNRA rates were mainly regulated by the abundance of their functional genes (e.g.,  nirS, nirK  and  nrfA ), followed by environmental factors (e.g., sediment organic carbon) ( Jiang et al., 2023 ).  Marshall et al. (2021)  also reported a decrease in anammox functional gene abundance in conjunction with the decreasing organic carbon content. Similarly, in the current study, we also found that most of the N-cycling pathways (including denitrification, DNRA, ANRA, and anammox) were significantly correlated with SOM or DOC due to the influence of plant growth and litter in BYD Lake, the contents of SOM and DOC in sediment are higher in summer and fallMoreover, N-cycling functional genes including  norC, nirK, narI,  and hao showed a significant correlation with DOC ( p <  0.05). This could be explained by the fact that organic carbon input can stimulate microbial N-cycling as organic carbon acts as an electron donor for various N-reduction pathways in organotrophic N-reducing reactions, such as denitrification ( Baumann et al., 2022 ). Previous studies have also reported that higher available carbon (DOC) can promote denitrification ( Stewart et al., 2013 ;  Morse et al., 2014 ) due to N-cycling microorganisms can utilize organic carbon for mixed nutrient growth ( Jiang et al., 2023 ). This further illustrates that the denitrification process in the BYD sediment is the dominant process. Furthermore, our result showed that T (°C) significantly correlated with the denitrification pathway (r ≥ 4,  p  = 0.01–0.05,  Figure 2 ) in summer and fall. This also confirms that the nitrogen cycle process is a microbial-dominated process and is therefore more sensitive to temperature. Specifically, a significant correlation was observed between T and  nirK  (r = −0.7),  norC  (r = 0.9),  narl  (r = −0.7) ( p  < 0.05,  Supplementary Figure S6 ). Studies have shown that the abundance of genes related to ANRN and denitrification pathways decreases with increasing temperature ( Yang et al., 2023 ).  Pajares et al. (2017)  also found that  nirK  is negatively related to T, furthermore, the elevated temperature will increase denitrification rates ( Dai et al., 2020 ). This highlights the importance of temperature as one of the main factors influencing the functional genes related to N-cycling in lakes ( Yuan et al., 2023 ). Therefore, the impact of seasonal changes on N-cycling triggering the retention and emission of nitrogen in the lake should be paid more attention by the management department. Previous studies have also reported that antibiotic pollution could alter the N-cycling process ( Wu J. et al., 2022 ). For example, sulfadiazine inhibits functional genes related to denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation in sediments ( Wang M. et al., 2023 ;  Wang X. et al., 2023 ). As well as, nitrifier-denitrification rates were inhibited by sulfamethoxazole ( Chen et al., 2022 ). Remarkably, in the current study, N-cycling pathways significantly correlated with antibiotics. For instance, denitrification exhibited a significant correlation with NOR in spring (r ≥ 4,  p  = 0.01–0.05,  Figure 2 ), and OFL in summer (r ≥ 4,  p  = 0.01–0.05,  Figure 2 ). Nitrification was significantly correlated with SPD (r ≥ 4,  p  = 0.01–0.05,  Figure 2 ). Anammox had a significant correlation with TC in spring and fall, and NOR in fall (r ≥ 4,  p  = 0.01–0.05,  Figure 2 ). Our previous study ( Zhang et al., 2023 ) found that NOR and OFL was the main antibiotics in BYD lake sediments, indicating that more attention should be paid to the effect of antibiotics on the N-cycling in the future. Consequently, more concerns should be given to antibiotics pollution in N-cycling studies in eutrophic water bodies. Given this perspective, DOC or SOM, T and antibiotics (e.g., norfloxacin and ofloxacin) were significantly correlated with N-cycling processes and they might be potentially key factors influencing the seasonal N-cycling processes in lake ecosystems."

120,introduction,"Introduction The last glacial period is characterized by centennial- to millennial-scale climate oscillations known as Dansgaard - Oeschger (D-O) cycles. At least 25 D-O cycles were identified in Greenland ice cores and characterized by warm Greenland interstadials (GI) and cold Greenland stadials (GS) 1 – 3 . Though the timing, duration, and spatial extent of D-O cycles are well-documented, uncertainties exist regarding their triggers and pacing. Proposed causes for D-O cycles include changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and solar and volcanic forcing 4 – 9 . While D-O cycles are well documented for the last glacial period 1 , 10 – 15 , there are only very few terrestrial proxy records which provide unambiguous evidence for their existence during the preceding glacial periods 12 – 14 , 16 – 19 . This knowledge gap limits our ability to evaluate the influence of different glacial boundary conditions on D-O variability, which would contribute to a better understanding of their driving mechanisms. The penultimate glacial period corresponding to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (191-130 kyrs BP) was most likely one of the strongest Quaternary glaciations, with much greater ice sheet extent throughout Eurasia 20 , 21 . Though MIS 6 is not directly covered by Greenland ice core records, a synthetic δ 18 O Greenland record suggests the occurrence of D-O like cycles during the penultimate glacial 22 . Further records are needed to better understand D-O cycles and to characterize their pattern, timing, and spatial extent. Such information can be obtained from speleothems, which are known to be an ideal archive for identifying D-O cycles 15 . However, speleothem-based climate reconstructions covering the penultimate and preceding glacial periods are still rare and most of them do not display a clear D-O pattern in their isotopic profiles 11 , 23 – 29 . At present, D-O cycles have been explicitly identified in tropical and subtropical speleothems from Sanbao Cave 16  and Huagapo Cave 17 , respectively, but additional precisely dated and highly resolved paleoclimate records are urgently needed to verify the synthetic Greenland ice core record and to develop a more detailed stratigraphy for D-O cycles during MIS 6. Here we present an extended Sofular record for MIS 2-4 and parts of MIS 6/7 to show D-O cycles in very close detail. Complementing previous studies 30 , 31 , we present so far unpublished δ 13 C isotope profiles to provide further evidence for a very close atmospheric coupling between the eastern Mediterranean and the North Atlantic during the penultimate glacial period. Because of the very strong atmospheric connection between the North Atlantic region and Northern Türkiye 15 , 30 , 31 , Sofular stalagmites are very well suited to investigate millennial-scale variability for glacial periods preceding MIS 2-4."
121,results,"Results and discussion Study site Sofular Cave (41°25’N, 31°56’E) is located in the North Anatolian mountains in Türkiye, ~10 km inland from the southern Black Sea coast (Fig.  1 ). The cave is within the Lower Cretaceous limestones. Mean annual temperature and total precipitation average ~13.3 °C and ~1,200 mm yr −1 , respectively. Although ~75% of total annual precipitation occurs between September and April, infiltration of rainwater occurs most likely throughout the year. Moisture originates predominantly from the Black Sea and, to a lesser extent, from the Marmara and Mediterranean Sea 30 , 31 . The soil above the cave is of heterogeneous thickness and covered by dense vegetation of deciduous trees (e.g., oaks, elms, and beeches), shrubs, and marginal grasslands. Fig. 1 Map showing Eurasia including the location of Sofular Cave (red star). Black circles mark the location of Lake Van and Black Sea sediment cores GC25-1 and MSM33. The maximum extent of the Eurasian Ice Sheet during the Saalian (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6; ice sheet boundaries redrawn after Svendsen et al. 20 ) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 60  are shown by the blue and red lines, respectively. Arrows indicate potential meltwater pathways during MIS 6. Chronology The chronology of the Sofular record is based on 150  230 Th ages, all of which are in stratigraphic order. Uranium concentrations of ~0.5 ppm and low common thorium result in very precise  230 Th ages for all stalagmites with typical age uncertainties of ~0.5%. The Sofular record covers the last 205,000 years before present (BP = 1950) almost continuously, except for two gaps between 24.1 - 21.6 kyrs BP and 160 - 134 kyrs BP (Figs.  2  and  3 ).

Numbers above the records denote D-O events. Source data are provided in the Source Data file. Sofular isotope profiles The average temporal resolution of the entire Sofular record is around 40 years. Including previous studies 30 , 31 , 8540 stable oxygen (δ 18 O) and carbon (δ 13 C) isotope measurements were performed. Additional high-resolution data were obtained from stalagmites So-4, So-13 and So-57, and we now present the complete Sofular δ 13 C record. δ 18 O and δ 13 C values range from −7.6‰ to −17.8‰ (VPBD) and −2.7‰ to −10.6‰ (VPBD), respectively (Fig.  2 ). Oxygen and carbon isotope profiles of all stalagmites are very similar, with correlation coefficients ( r ) of stalagmites covering MIS 1-4 (So-1, So-2, So-4, So-13) typically ranging from ~0.4 to ~1.0 (determined using  iscam 32 )(Supplementary Fig.  1a, b ). For MIS 6 (So-4 and So-57) correlation coefficients range from ~0.7 to ~1.0 (Supplementary Fig.  1c ). For both MIS 2-4 and MIS 6, isotope profiles show distinct centennial- to millennial-scale variability and D-O like patterns, which are, even on multi-decadal timescales, very similar to those recorded in Greenland ice cores (Fig.  3 ). The strong resemblance between the Sofular and NGRIP isotope records demonstrates the very close and rapid atmospheric coupling between the North Atlantic and Black Sea region 15 , 30 , 33 . D-O related variations of 0.5 to 1.5‰ in speleothem δ 18 O are most likely caused by multiple factors such as air temperature, variations in δ 18 O of the moisture source, seasonality, and amount of precipitation above Sofular Cave 30 , 31 . On orbital time-scales fluctuations in Sofular δ 18 O values track changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of Black Sea surface water through the so-called water vapor source effect 30 , 31 . δ 18 O values of around −8.5 ± 1‰ mark periods when the Black Sea was connected with the Mediterranean Sea when the sea level was higher than the Bosporus sill depth of ~35 meters below current sea level 31 . More negative δ 18 O values are therefore indicative of a Black Sea “Lake” 34  without inflow of saline Mediterranean water. Pronounced negative excursions in δ 18 O of up to −17.8‰, however, indicate the inflow of isotopically depleted meltwater from the Caspian Sea and rivers entering the Black Sea”Lake” 34  (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Thus, the water vapor source effect in combination with variable mixing times of the Black Sea 35  affected D-O related fluctuations in δ 18 O during MIS 2-4 and particularly during MIS 6. This effect is also apparent in Sofular stalagmites So-1 and So-2 δ 18 O profiles which show a suppressed Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas isotopic pattern 31  (Fig.  2 ). In contrast, D-O cycles are more clearly visible in the Sofular δ 13 C isotope profiles indicating a high sensitivity of δ 13 C to D-O climate variability. Millennial-scale δ 13 C fluctuations in Sofular speleothems are similar between the last and penultimate glacial ranging from −5‰ to −10‰. Though So-4 and So-57 δ 13 C profiles show an almost identical isotopic pattern, δ 13 C values of stalagmite So-57 are on average 1.3‰ more positive. This isotopic offset is most likely related to sample-specific effects caused by lower drip rates and stronger fractionation due to CO 2  degassing. In order to reduce sample-specific effects, age uncertainties and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we developed a stacked δ 13 C record of MIS 1-4 and MIS 6 using the program called intra-site correlation age modeling ( iscam ) 32 .  Iscam  was designed to synchronize overlapping time series from the same site within their age uncertainties. D-O cycles in the Sofular δ 13 C stacked record are characterized by high amplitude shifts of up to 6‰ (Fig.  3a ). We suggest that these shifts are primarily caused by temperature- and moisture-related changes in vegetation and soil microbial activity, with higher vegetation density and soil respiration rates associated with warmer and wetter GIs (Fig.  3a ). Our assumption is based on the following lines of evidence. Firstly, a close coupling between climate and soil respiration rates is directly supported by paired δ 13 C and  14 C measurements in stalagmite So-1 36 . The paired measurements reveal a rapid response of soil respiration rates and microbial activity across the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas in stalagmite So-1, with enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) under warmer and wetter climatic conditions 36 . Secondly, soil respiration rate is closely linked to temperature and soil moisture conditions on a range of timescales 37 , 38 , a relationship that is supported by modeling experiments 39  and speleothem records from western Europe 40 – 42 . Thirdly, the Sofular δ 13 C stacked records show an inverse correlation ( r 2 ) of ~0.7 (MIS 2-4) and ~0.5 (MIS 6) with sea surface temperature (SST) records from the Black Sea (gravity core GC25-1 & MSM33) 33 , 43  (Fig.  4 , Supplementary Figs.  3  and  4 ). Such a close coupling between air temperature above Sofular Cave and Black Sea SSTs can be expected as the cave site is only ~10 km inland. Therefore, positive SST shifts of up to 4 °C associated with GIs 33  (Fig.  3 ) would lead to a marked increase in temperature and precipitation above Sofular Cave, thereby promoting a change in the type and density of vegetation 44  and an increase in soil respiration rates due to higher soil microbial activity and faster decomposition of SOM 36 . In contrast, cold-dry climatic conditions would affect vegetation density and type and reduce CO 2  production due to lower microbial activity, and sparser vegetation is expected to result in lower soil  p CO 2 , lower contribution of biogenic carbon, and, consequently, higher stalagmite δ 13 C values. Fig. 4 Correlation between Sofular δ 13 C and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Black Sea. The scatterplots show Sofular δ 13 C values of Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) onsets, midpoints and peaks vs sea surface temperatures (SST) from the Black Sea 33 , 43  during  a  the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2-4 ( n  = 45 and p<<0.01) and  b  Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 ( n  = 9 and p ~ 0.04). Shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence interval. The Sofular stack (Fig.  3a ) exhibits the most positive δ 13 C values of around −3‰ at ~62 kyrs BP, concomitant with a major advance of the Eurasian Ice Sheet (EIS) 45 , 46  and Heinrich event 6. In the Black Sea region, this interval was dominated by steppe pollen taxa 44  and higher ice-rafted debris in Black Sea sediments 47 . Heinrich events H5 – H0 are also well expressed in the Sofular δ 13 C profile, and characterized by marked SST decreases of the Black Sea (Fig.  3a ) and reduced precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean 33 , 47 , 48 . Climate simulations suggest colder and drier conditions induced by a cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomaly modulating the eastward advection of cold air over Eurasia caused by a weakening of the AMOC during Heinrich events and GSs 49 – 52 . D-O cycles during MIS 6 During MIS 6, a D-O like climate variability is apparent in the δ 13 C records of stalagmites So-4 and So-57. Similar to MIS 2-4, D-O cycles during MIS 6 are characterized by abrupt negative shifts of up to 4‰ in δ 13 C (Fig.  3b ) in response to warmer and more humid climatic conditions and higher soil respiration rates, denser vegetation and higher proportions of C3 plant vegetation 36 . Phases of increasing temperature and higher effective moisture are broadly consistent with pollen evidence ( dec. Quercus, Betula, Pinus ) from Lake Van 53  (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). D-O cycles in the Sofular stack mirror those of the synthetic Greenland ice core δ 18 O record 22  (Fig.  3b ), which was tuned to the absolutely-dated Sanbao Cave record 11 , 54 . Radiometrically dated records showing a clear D-O like pattern are currently very rare and their temporal resolution and/or chronological precision are not sufficient to identify D-O cycles 26 , 27 , 55 , 56 . Thus, records that can be used for a detailed comparison to Sofular are rather scarce. Suitable time series are speleothem δ 18 O records from Sanbao Cave 16  in China and Huagapo Cave 17  in Peru (Fig.  3b ). Taking advantage of the precise and absolute chronologies of these stalagmite records, including our Sofular stack, we can gain further information on the pacing and timing of D-O like events during MIS 6. The comparison between the records show age offsets of several centuries for D-O 6.6, 6.8, 6.9 and 6.12 (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Higher age offsets between the records of almost two millennia are observed for D-O 6.7, 6.10, 6.11, 6.13 and 6.14, likely caused by a combination of uncertainties related to the age models and uncertain assignment of D-O events. For the time interval between 200 and 160 kyrs BP, the average pacing of D-O cycles is ~4.16 kyrs in the Sofular stack (Fig.  5b , Supplementary Fig.  6 ), very similar to the pacing of ~4.24 kyrs and ~4.03 kyrs in the Huagapo and Sanbao speleothem records, respectively. All speleothem-based estimates for the D-O pacing are in agreement with a pacing of ~4.00 kyrs in the synthetic Greenland ice core. In contrast, the average D-O pacing recorded by the Sofular stack during MIS 2-4 is ~2.07 kyrs (Fig.  5a , Supplementary Fig.  7 ), and therefore only half as long compared to MIS 6. The Speleothem Interstadial Onset Compilation data set (SIOC19) and Greenland ice cores show an almost identical D-O pacing of ~2.04 kyrs and ~2.09 kyrs respectively (Fig.  5a ). Thus, the absolutely dated Sofular stack record presented here provides additional evidence for a longer pacing of D-O cycles during MIS 6. Since D-O events are closely linked to changes in the strength of AMOC, which in turn is dependent on the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation and sea-ice extent 52 , the longer pacing of D-O cycles is most likely directly related to a different AMOC setting during MIS 6. Benthic foraminifera isotope data from the Portuguese margin suggest a shallower and weaker AMOC cell during MIS 6 than during MIS 3 13 . This is in agreement with longer bipolar seesaw events 57 , greater sea ice cover, and lower amplitude SST variability in the South Atlantic 58 . Furthermore, iceberg discharge into the North Atlantic was muted during the first half of MIS 6 and ‘classic’ Heinrich events are missing 13 , 57 . Overall, there is strong evidence for a weaker AMOC during the penultimate glaciation. AMOC weakening leads to a considerable cooling in the North Atlantic realm and sea-ice advance over the Labrador and Nordic Seas, which in turn increases surface albedo and reduces heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere 52 . As a result of these different mean climatic and glacial boundary conditions during MIS 6, thresholds for triggering D-O cycles were most likely higher and led to less frequent and longer pacing of D-O cycles. However, additional and more detailed reconstructions of AMOC intensity during MIS 6 are urgently needed to prove our hypothesis. Fig. 5 Pacing of Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles in Sofular and comparison of stalagmite and ice core chronologies. Comparison of D-O pacing between:  a  D-O cycles during the last glacial period, recorded in the Greenland ice core NGRIP (data from Rasmussen et al. 3 ), the Sofular stacked record and a Speleothem Interstadial Onset Compilation (SIOC19) data set (data from Corrick et al. 15 ) and  b  D-O cycles of the penultimate glacial period, recorded in the synthetic ice core record 22 , the Sofular stacked record, the Huagapo Cave speleothem record 17  and the Sanbao Cave speleothem record 16 . Numbers within the legends refer to the average pacings of D-O events which are taken into account by black arrows. In conclusion, the stacked Sofular δ 13 C record shows D-O climate variability for the last and penultimate glacial in great detail and thereby provides additional evidence for D-O variability in the synthetic Greenland ice core record. The comparison of absolutely dated speleothem records covering MIS 6, including the Sofular stack, reveals an agreement in both the timing and pacing of D-O cycles. Thus, there is mounting evidence for a significantly longer pacing of D-O cycles during MIS 6 compared to MIS 2-4. This could be related to a generally weaker and shallower AMOC and reduced northward heat transport and significant cooling of the North Atlantic realm, thereby inducing a lower pacing of D-O events during MIS 6."

123,results,"Results The AMOC Impact on the Arctic Amplification. We begin by comparing the changes in surface air temperature over the Arctic (60 o N–90 o N) between observations and the free-AMOC simulation ( Materials and Methods ). Despite decadal variability, both observations and model simulation display a significant trend of rapid surface warming in the Arctic ( Fig. 1 B ). Between 1901 and 2022, observations show a warming trend of 0.17 ± 0.01 °C decade −1  (observational mean trend ± one SD of trends among observations), while the free-AMOC simulation shows a warming trend of 0.27 ± 0.01 °C decade −1  (ensemble mean trend ± one SD of trends among ensembles). The overlap of observations and model results suggests that CCSM4 can generally well simulate the observed Arctic warming. We further examine Arctic surface (2-m) air temperature changes in the two suites of CCSM4 simulations. Between 1981 and 2100, Arctic warming trends are 0.72 ± 0.02 °C decade −1  and 0.85 ± 0.02 °C decade −1  (ensemble mean trend ± one SD of trends among ensembles) for the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations, respectively. Notably, the free-AMOC simulation reveals a slower warming rate compared to the fixed-AMOC simulation. This difference becomes more pronounced after the 2030s and reaches its peak during the last two decades of the century ( Fig. 1 B ). A comparison between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations reveals approximately 2 °C less warming generally across the Arctic during 2081 and 2100 ( Figs. 1 B  and  2  A  and  B ). This reduced warming, or AMOC-induced anomalous cooling, is particularly striking in the North Atlantic, adjacent to the south of Greenland, often referred to as the North Atlantic warming hole ( 36 ) ( Fig. 2 C ). Our findings are further substantiated through the analysis of zonal-averaged surface temperature and Arctic amplification factor (AF) changes ( Fig. 1  C  and  D ). The weakened AMOC decelerates Arctic warming by 1.37 °C and reduces the Arctic AF by 0.36 in terms of the annual and ensemble mean. Seasonally, the AMOC-induced cooling is most prominent during the cold seasons from December to March. Fig. 2.

To better understand the physical processes by which a weakened AMOC influences Arctic amplification, we use radiative kernels ( 40 ) to quantify radiative feedback and partial temperature contributions ( Materials and Methods ) to Arctic amplification. The partial temperature contribution is helpful for comparing the relative strengths of feedbacks; however, it is a diagnostic decomposition of the local energy budget, and the warming attributed to any individual feedback need not be realized. This distinction is due to the interactions between feedbacks and with climate system characteristics such as ocean heat content at seasonal scales ( 41 ), and the use of transient simulations. Meanwhile, because our simulations are identically forced by anthropogenic factors (i.e., greenhouse gases and aerosols), the radiative forcing cannot explain the different surface temperature responses. As a result, we include the forcing-associated warming in the residual rather than calculating it explicitly, noting that the difference in residuals in  Fig. 3 C  is near zero. Among a variety of factors, we find that surface albedo feedback emerges as the main driver of the annual mean Arctic warming, which, on average, explains 3.52 K and 4.12 K of Arctic warming over 2081 to 2100 in the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations, respectively ( Fig. 3  A  and  B ). The surface albedo feedback results from sea ice melting, which decreases surface reflectivity and increases the absorption of solar radiation, thereby warming the surface. Given that feedbacks interact and compensate for one another, while the surface albedo feedback promotes a large radiative response, other processes are crucial in how the surface temperature change manifests, as we will show below. Fig. 3. Partial annual mean surface air temperature changes for the Arctic (60°N–90°N) compared to the tropics (30°S–30°N) from the ( A ) free- and ( B ) fixed-AMOC simulations during 2081 to 2100 compared to 1961 to 1980, and ( C ) AMOC impacts on annual mean temperature changes (free − fixed, A − B). Colored scatters present the partial temperature contributions due to Planck response, the lapse rate, water vapor, shortwave and longwave cloud feedbacks, AET, ocean heat uptake/loss, and the residual term. ( D  and  E ) Same as ( C ) but for AMOC impacts on boreal ( D ) summer (June-July-August; JJA) and ( E ) winter (December-January-February; DJF) temperature changes. Error bars show the one SD of the differences of five ensemble members between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations for all panels. The extent of the impact of surface albedo feedback closely aligns with the reduction in annual mean Arctic sea ice concentration. Despite Arctic sea ice dwindling in response to global warming in both CCSM4 simulations ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1  A  and  B ), the decrease in sea ice cover across the Arctic is 10% less severe for a weakened AMOC than it would be in the case of a fixed AMOC. However, in specific regions adjacent to the Atlantic and central areas between the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea, the lessened sea ice reduction can reach up to 20% ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 C ). The relatively less abated Arctic sea ice, particularly in regions near the Atlantic, is linked to the weakened Atlantic overturning and associated decrease in the northward OHT ( 20 ,  39 ,  42 ) across the Atlantic sector ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). The reduced sea ice loss around the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea, on the other hand, is likely linked to air–sea–ice interactions ( 41 ) as well as a decrease in the northward OHT through the Bering Strait ( 41 ). This is because the weakened AMOC can deepen the Aleutian low during boreal winter via atmospheric teleconnections ( 36 ) and hence modify the ocean circulation and heat transport over the Bering Sea. Compared to the fixed-AMOC case, the slowed AMOC diminishes the increase of the northward OHT through the Bering Strait by 0.01 petawatt (PW) between 2081 and 2100 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). Over the Arctic region, the abated sea ice loss induces approximately 44% (−0.60 K) of the reduced warming, which is primarily attributed to surface albedo feedback ( Fig. 3 C ), particularly evident in areas characterized by relatively pronounced reduction of sea ice loss ( Fig. 2 G  and  SI Appendix , Fig. S1 C ). The AMOC slowdown can also effectively modulate Arctic warming by changing annual mean ocean heat uptake/loss. We find that the weakened AMOC reduces Arctic warming by approximately 34% (−0.47 K) via altering ocean heat uptake/loss over the Arctic Mediterranean ( 43 ), making it the second most substantial contributor to the cooling process ( Fig. 3 C ). To elucidate the detailed oceanic cooling process, we calculate the difference in ocean temperature budgets between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations between 2081 and 2100 ( Materials and Methods ). We find that a weakened AMOC causes a general OHT divergence and, as a result, a cooling tendency of whole-depth water in the subpolar North Atlantic as well as the Atlantic sector of the Arctic, including the Labrador and Greenland Seas ( Fig. 4 A ). This OHT divergence promotes ocean heat uptake via the ocean surface ( Fig. 4 B ), primarily through turbulent heat flux ( 36 ,  44 ,  45 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S8 K ), but it also dominates the ocean temperature budget, resulting in a net cooling of Arctic waters ( Fig. 4 C ), diminished ocean heat storage, and a lessened sea ice loss in these regions ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 C ). To counterbalance the AMOC-induced OHT divergence, the ocean responds by absorbing more heat from the atmosphere, thereby engendering a cooling effect on surface temperature. It merits attention that beyond the Labrador and Greenland Seas, the AMOC slowdown may indirectly affect the local processes ( 17 ) over the Barents, Kara, and Chukchi Seas, where OHT divergence and ocean heat uptake are also visible ( Fig. 4  A  and  B ). Fig. 4. ( A – C ) Annual and ensemble mean ocean temperature tendency differences between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations (free − fixed) during 2081 to 2100 induced by ( A ) OHT convergence/divergence (convergence positive, divergence negative) and ( B ) net surface heat flux across ocean surface (downward positive), as well as ( C ) the net vertically integrated temperature tendency (A plus B). ( D – F ) Annual and ensemble mean differences between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations (free − fixed) during 2081 to 2100 for ( D ) TOA and ( E ) surface energy fluxes (positive downward), and ( F ) AET convergence/divergence (E − D; convergence positive, divergence negative). In all panels, only differences statistically significant at the 95% confidence level are shown. On the other hand, the AMOC-enhanced ocean heat uptake change ( Fig. 4 E ) is much larger in magnitude than the AMOC-induced net TOA radiation change ( Fig. 4 D ), which induces a general convergence of AET over the Arctic, particularly over the North Atlantic warming hole and around the Bering Strait ( Fig. 4 F ). The zonally integrated AET reveals that the weakened AMOC causes an overall net increase in the total AET ( Materials and Methods ) in the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes, owing primarily to an enhanced (stationary plus transient) eddy energy transport component ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). The increase in the northward AET at 60°N amounts to 0.04 PW, meaning that the AMOC-induced AET change enhances rather than reduces Arctic amplification ( Fig. 3 C ). It is also worth noting the opposite AET and OHT changes caused by AMOC slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ), which leads to a much smaller change in the total atmospheric and oceanic energy transports and indicates the Bjerknes compensation ( 19 ,  46 ). The slowed AMOC can also have a significant impact on Arctic amplification via temperature feedback. Specifically, the contributions from vertically uniform temperature change, known as the Planck feedback, are 1.80 K with a weakened AMOC and 2.10 K with a fixed AMOC ( Fig. 3  A  and  B ). The Planck feedback promotes warming of the Arctic because the feedback is weaker (i.e., less stabilizing) in the Arctic than in the tropics; it is calculated as a deviation from its global and annual mean ( Materials and Methods ). Contributions arising from deviations from a vertically uniform temperature change, known as the lapse rate feedback, are 1.70 K for the free- and 2.02 K for the fixed-AMOC simulations ( Fig. 3  A  and  B ). Collectively, a weakened AMOC could result in approximately 43% (−0.61 K) of the cooling effect in the Arctic due to the total temperature feedback. AMOC-induced changes in the Planck response primarily appear as a surface cooling across the Arctic and its neighboring regions. However, a notable exception is the North Atlantic warming hole, where the Planck response contributes to an anomalous surface warming ( Fig. 2 D ). This geographic distinction reveals that the Planck response is weaker over the North Atlantic warming hole in the free-AMOC simulation, leading to a more significant anomalous warming effect than in other regions due to the strikingly colder surface temperatures in this area ( 47 ). In contrast to the free-AMOC simulation, the Planck response is weaker over the central Arctic in the fixed-AMOC simulation. Despite this difference, the temperature changes caused by the Planck response are largely offset by those caused by the lapse rate feedback. In the North Atlantic warming hole and Beaufort/Chukchi Sea regions, the surface cooling due to lapse rate feedback highlights an unevenly distributed vertical temperature profile ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 ). In response to a weakened AMOC, air temperatures show marked cooling in the lower-to-mid troposphere, while the upper troposphere exhibits weaker cooling. In comparison to the aforementioned factors, AMOC-induced changes in cloud feedback (4%; 0.06 K) and water vapor feedback (12%; −0.17 K) contribute less to Arctic amplification. The cloud feedback, in particular, can be further divided into a shortwave (sw) cloud feedback and a longwave (lw) cloud feedback. A weakened AMOC would add approximately 13% (0.18 K) to Arctic warming via sw cloud feedback in comparison to a fixed AMOC, but this effect is largely compensated by the cooling effect from lw cloud feedback ( Fig. 3 C ). Regardless, the rationale for the warming is that less Arctic sea ice is associated with fewer low clouds ( 48 ,  49 ). Thus, as the AMOC decelerates and sea ice loss becomes less pronounced, the cloud fraction diminishes ( SI Appendix , Figs. S1 C  and S4 C ). In particular, fewer low-level clouds ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 C ) reduce the amount of sw radiation that is reflected back into space and hence warm the surface of the Arctic. Additionally, the influences of surface albedo feedback and ocean heat uptake change are inextricably linked on seasonal timescales, such that their relative importance in Arctic amplification may vary by season ( 7 ,  17 ,  41 ,  50 – 53 ). In a warming climate, Arctic surface albedo feedback is especially strong during boreal summer (JJA;  SI Appendix , Fig. S5  A  and  B ), when large sea ice reduction ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1  D  and  E ) leads to more open ocean, allowing more atmospheric heat (primarily solar energy) to enter and be stored in the central Arctic Ocean ( SI Appendix , Fig. S9  A  and  E ). Consequently, ocean heat uptake acts to abate summertime Arctic warming. The stored oceanic heat is released to the atmosphere during boreal winter (DJF), which does not always occur in the same locations as summer solar energy absorption due to horizontal advection of heat in the ocean ( 17 ). Wintertime oceanic heat release is particularly prevalent in the Kara, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas, where significant sea ice loss occurs ( SI Appendix , Fig. S10  D  and  H ). Sea ice loss in these regions opens the ocean, exposing warmer ocean surfaces to colder air and creating a large air–sea temperature contrast. As a result, the ocean releases heat to the atmosphere via turbulent heat flux and drives wintertime Arctic warming ( SI Appendix , Fig. S10  C  and  G ). It merits attention that the North Atlantic warming hole region experiences persistent anomalous ocean heat uptake (or diminished oceanic heat release) throughout all seasons, differing from the seasonal ocean heat uptake and loss in the central Atlantic. The AMOC slowdown abates Arctic warming through surface albedo feedback, particularly during boreal summer ( Fig. 3  D  and  E ), rather than winter. This is because, while the weakened AMOC mitigates Arctic sea ice loss all year round ( 36 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ), the Arctic is dark during boreal winter, nearly eliminating surface albedo feedback ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5  C  and  D ). Additionally, the AMOC slowdown slightly reduces the cooling effect of ocean heat uptake during boreal summer ( Fig. 3 D ), especially over the central Arctic. However, it dramatically weakens the warming effect in boreal winter, which serves as the strongest AMOC-influencing factor on Arctic surface temperature during this season ( Fig. 3 E ). This AMOC effect is achieved through reduced oceanic heat release in the central Arctic and persistent anomalous ocean heat uptake south of Greenland ( SI Appendix , Fig. S10 L )."
124,discussion,"Discussion In summary, we compare CCSM4 free- and fixed-AMOC simulations to determine the impact of a weakened AMOC on Arctic amplification under the RCP8.5 scenario throughout the twenty-first century. We find that the current and projected AMOC slowdown can reduce surface warming over the Arctic. By the end of the century, the strongest AMOC-induced cooling will appear on the Atlantic sector, with temperature changes reaching 5 °C. This cooling phenomenon is primarily linked to a notable slowing in the loss of Arctic sea ice. Surface albedo feedback is identified as the primary contributor to AMOC-induced cooling, accounting for approximately 44% of the cooling. Modifications in ocean heat absorption and temperature feedback are another way that the AMOC affects Arctic amplification. A weakened AMOC, in particular, brings about a general OHT divergence over the Arctic Mediterranean, causing the ocean to absorb more heat from the atmosphere to compensate for the AMOC-induced OHT divergence, resulting in surface temperature cooling. Surface albedo feedback and ocean heat uptake change are inherently linked on seasonal timescales, with their relative importance in Arctic amplification varying by season ( 17 ,  18 ). Note that the surface albedo feedback and ocean heat uptake change compensate one another in both free- and fixed-AMOC global warming simulations ( Fig. 3  A  and  B ), whereas the difference between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations shows that both factors collectively contribute to the reduced Arctic warming ( Fig. 3 C ). The weakened AMOC can also diminish Arctic warming through lapse rate feedback, causing strong cooling from the surface to the lower-to-mid troposphere while leading to relatively weaker cooling in the upper troposphere. Although changes in sw cloud feedback slightly warm the average surface temperature over the Arctic, they contribute to a strong cooling over the North Atlantic warming hole region due to increased low-level cloud fraction from AMOC slowdown. These results shed light on the intricate mechanisms through which the AMOC exerts a substantial influence on Arctic amplification and advance our understanding of the complex dynamics underlying Arctic climate change."
125,materials|methods,"Materials and Methods Observed Surface Temperatures. To examine surface temperature changes in the Arctic since 1901, we utilize three distinct observed surface temperature datasets. These datasets include the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature product version 4 from NASA, derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys, and other sensors ( 54 ,  55 ); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis (NOAAGlobalTemp) that combines long-term sea surface temperature (SST) with land surface temperature datasets, including Extended Reconstructed SST, Global Historical Climatology Network, International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set-Release 3, and International Arctic Buoy Programme ( 56 ); and the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climate Research Unit global surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT5) that is a combination of SST measurements from ships and buoys and near-surface air temperature measurements from weather stations ( 57 ). For all three observations, we analyze the monthly surface temperature data using a regular grid of 2 × 2 for GISTEMP, 5 × 5 for NOAAGlobalTemp, and HadCRUT5. Our examination covers the period from 1901 to 2022. To establish annual mean anomalies, we calculate deviations from the climatological average between 1901 and 1980. CCSM4 Simulations. We utilize a five-member ensemble for the broadly used CCSM4 historical and RCP8.5 (free-AMOC) simulations. We especially focus on the historical period of 1961 to 1980 and RCP8.5 period of 2081 to 2100. Based on the free-AMOC simulation, we conduct a parallel sensitivity (fixed-AMOC) experiment with five ensemble members. The fixed-AMOC experiment is branched from the free-AMOC simulation in year 1980 and driven by the same historical and RCP8.5 forcing agents as the free-AMOC simulation onward except with a small amount of freshwater gradually removed over the region covering the north of 50°N in the North Atlantic and the Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian Seas and then uniformly redistributed to the rest of global oceans (see more details in refs.  36 – 39 ). This freshwater scheme implemented in the fixed-AMOC experiment maintains a near-constant AMOC strength since 1980. Here, the AMOC strength is defined as the maximum of meridional overturning streamfunction below 500 m in the North Atlantic. We used monthly averaged model data for our analysis. Radiative Feedback. We apply the radiative kernel technique ( 58 ,  59 ) to calculate the climate feedback (in units of W m −2  K −1 ) from a TOA perspective, using CAM5 radiative kernels ( 40 ). The surface albedo feedback is calculated as [1] λ alb = Δ R alb Δ T s = K alb × Δ a l b Δ T s . The Planck feedback is calculated as [2] λ plk = Δ R plk Δ T s = K T s × Δ T s + ∫ p 0 p K T a × Δ T s d p Δ T s . The lapse rate feedback is calculated as [3] λ lr = Δ R lr Δ T s = ∫ p 0 p K T a × Δ T a - Δ T s d p Δ T s . The water vapor feedback is calculated as [4] λ wv = Δ R wv Δ T s = ∫ p 0 p K q × Δ ln q d p Δ T s . The sw and lw cloud feedbacks are calculated as [5] λ s w _ c l d = Δ R s w cld Δ T s = Δ CRF sw + K s w q cs - K s w q Δ q + K a cs - K a Δ a + G sw cs - G sw Δ T s , 
 [6] λ l w _ c l d = Δ R l w cld Δ T s = Δ CRF lw + K l w q cs - K l w q Δ q + K T a cs - K T a Δ T a + K T s cs - K T s Δ T s + G lw cs - G lw Δ T s . In Eqs.  1 – 6 ,  p 0  represents the surface pressure level,  p  represents the pressure level of tropopause, Δ R  represents the change in TOA radiation due to individual feedback (subscript denoting each feedback),  K  and  K CS  represent all-sky and clear-sky radiative kernel responses to small perturbations (subscript denoting each perturbation), Δ alb  represents surface albedo change between 2081 to 2100 and 1961 to 1980, Δ T S  represents surface temperature change, [Δ T S ] represents zonally averaged surface temperature change ( 60 ), Δ T a  represents air temperature change,  q  represents specific humidity, Δ CRF  represents the change in cloud radiative forcing where subscripts denote sw and lw, and  G  and  G CS  represent all-sky and clear-sky radiative forcing due to anthropogenic climate change where subscripts denote sw and lw. Partial Temperature Contribution. We use a local energy budget to convert the energetic contributions of radiative feedback and energy transport anomalies for 2081 to 2100 relative to 1961 to 1980 into contributions to near-surface warming in the tropics (30°S–30°N) and Arctic (60°N–90°N), as in previous studies ( 8 ,  11 ,  60 ,  61 ). For each region, the annual mean warming contributions are defined by dividing each term by the global-mean Planck feedback  λ plk ¯  as [7] Δ T s = - λ plk ′ Δ T s λ plk ¯ - ∑ i λ i Δ T s λ plk ¯ - Δ AET λ plk ¯ - Δ OHU λ plk ¯ - Δ R rd λ plk ¯ , where [Δ T S ] is the change in zonal-averaged surface air temperature between 2081 to 2100 and 1961 to 1980.  λ plk ′ = λ plk - λ plk ¯  denotes the difference between the regional, seasonal, and global annual averaged Planck feedback.  Δ AET = Δ R TOA - Δ R sfc , denoting the change in atmospheric energy convergence/divergence,  Δ OHU = Δ R sfc , denoting the change of net surface heat flux, and Δ R rd  is the residual term that includes the radiative forcing under the historical and RCP8.5 scenarios.  - λ plk ′ Δ T s λ plk ¯  represents the partial temperature contribution due to Planck response.  - ∑ i λ i Δ T s λ plk ¯  represents the partial temperature contributions due to the lapse rate, water vapor, albedo, sw, and lw cloud feedbacks.  - Δ AET λ plk ¯  represents the partial temperature contribution due to atmospheric energy convergence/divergence.  - Δ OHU λ plk ¯  represents the partial temperature contribution due to ocean heat uptake/loss.  - Δ R rd λ plk ¯  represents the partial temperature contribution due to the residual term. Ocean Temperature/Heat Budget. We analyze ocean temperature/heat budget, which states that the full-depth integrated ocean temperature tendencies at unit area can be written as [8] tendency tot = tendency shf + tendency OHTC , where  tendency tot  denotes the total vertically integrated temperature tendency,  tendency shf  denotes the temperature tendency induced by surface heat flux, and  tendency OHTC  denotes the temperature tendency due to OHT convergence/divergence ( 39 ). The  tendency OHTC  is computed using the advection and diffusion of heat in the ocean, which involves both the horizontal and vertical transport of heat by ocean circulations. Meridional OHT. We calculate the zonally integrated meridional OHT as [9] OHT = ∫ X W X E ∫ - H 0 ρ 0 C po ∇ ∙ v ¯ o θ + v o * θ + D d z d x , where  X E  and  X W  denote the longitudes of the western and eastern boundaries of ocean basin at certain latitude,  ρ 0  is sea water density,  C po  is the specific heat of sea water,  θ  is potential temperature of sea water, and − H  is ocean depth. ▽,  v ¯ o , and  v o ∗  are three-dimensional gradient operator and velocity, where  v ¯ o  is Eulerian-mean velocity, and  v o ∗  is the sum of mesoscale and submesoscale eddy-induced velocities.  D  denotes diffusion and other subgrid processes. Meridional AET. We calculate the total AET at latitude  ϕ  as the difference between TOA radiative fluxes  R TOA  and net surface heat flux  R sfc , [10] AET = 2 π a 2 ∫ ϕ - π / 2 R TOA - R sfc c o s ϕ ′ d ϕ ′ , where  a  is the radius of the Earth, and [.] represents zonal mean. The global averaged imbalance is removed from the integration to ensure the transport is zero at the poles. We further decompose the total AET into the components induced by mean meridional circulation (MMC) and eddies. The MMC component is calculated from the meridional wind  v a  and the moist static energy  h = c pa T a + L v q + g Z , where  c pa  is the specific heat of air at constant pressure,  T a  is air temperature,  L v  is the latent heat of vaporization of water,  g  is the acceleration of gravity, and  Z  is geopotential height. To prevent errors in cases where mass is not conserved in MMC, we remove the weighted vertical average of moist static energy ( 7 ). We calculate the MMC component as [11] MMC = - 2 π a c o s ϕ g ∫ 0 p s v a ¯ h ∼ d p , where  p s  is surface pressure and  h ∼ = [ h ¯ ] - ∑ p s 0 h ¯ d p / ∑ p s 0 d p . We calculate the eddy component as the difference between the total AET and MMC components, [12] EDDY = AET - MMC . Significance Test. The difference between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations is tested with two-sample Student t-distribution as [13] t = x ¯ - y ¯ s x 2 n + s y 2 n , where  x ¯  and  y ¯  are the ensemble means, and  s x  and  s y  are one SD from free- and fixed-AMOC simulations, respectively.  n  denotes the number of ensemble members for either simulation (five in this study)."

130,introduction,"INTRODUCTION As one of the largest heat reservoirs in the climate system, the global ocean absorbs a large fraction of the excess energy generated by the Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) during transient climate change ( 1 ,  2 ). Now, more than 90% of the excess energy from ongoing anthropogenic warming has accumulated in the ocean ( 3 – 5 ), strongly buffering global warming as well as causing an increase in ocean temperature, ocean heat content, and sea level. Moreover, the lag in the climate response to a forcing is a function of the rate of ocean heat uptake ( 2 ), with changes in that rate affecting the EEI ( 6 ,  7 ). In the past century, the greatest warming from the EEI has occurred in the upper 500 m in the ocean ( 4 ,  5 ,  8 ,  9 ), with relatively weak warming in the deep ocean because of its long response time ( 10 ) and the lingering impact of previous cooling associated with the Little Ice Age ( 11 – 13 ). This response can be expressed as a ratio between changes of global mean ocean temperature (∆GMOT) and global mean sea surface temperature (∆GMSST) or a measure of the ocean heat storage efficiency (HSE), with current HSE (∆GMOT/∆GMSST) << 1 (~0.1). Paleoceanographic observations, however, suggest that ∆GMOT can be comparable to or even larger than ∆GMSST on millennial and longer (near-equilibration) timescales. This implies that the ocean can serve as a far greater reservoir of energy in the climate system than implied by contemporary observations. Deep ocean temperature (DOT) proxies from marine sediment cores ( 14 – 16 ) and GMOT proxies from Antarctic ice cores ( 7 ,  17 ,  18 ) suggest that GMOT increased by ~2.8°C from the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM; ~26 to19 thousand years ago (ka)] to pre-Industrial (PI;  Fig. 1C ), comparable to (slightly smaller than) the concurrent change in GMSST reconstructed from SST proxies of around ~3.0° ± 0.2°C ( Fig. 1B ) ( 19 – 22 ). Recent air-sea disequilibrium studies suggest that the LGM ocean cooling reconstructed from noble gases in ice cores may be biased by −0.38° ± 0.37°C which is highly sensitive to model high-latitude winds [ Fig. 1C , ( 23 )]. Given the good agreement between two estimates for mean LGM DOT cooling relative to PI from marine proxy records [−2.63°C from ( 15 ); −2.82° ± 0.17°C from ( 16 )] and the ice core MOT estimate that neglects air-sea disequilibrium [−2.83° ± 0.5°C from the spline reconstruction of ( 7 )], we suggest that the effects of air-sea disequilibrium may be negligible. In any event, the overall GMOT warming magnitude is comparable to the increase in GMSST, leading to a deglacial ocean HSE of ~0.7 to 0.9, which is much closer to 1 (~1) ( Fig. 1D ) compared to modern HSE. Furthermore, observations show that the HSE exceeds 1 during the millennial-scale deglacial events Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; ~18 to 14.7 ka) and the Younger Dryas (YD; 12.9 to 11.5 ka) ( Fig. 1D ). Fig. 1. Model-data comparison for deglacial ocean temperature evolution. ( A ) Deglacial forcings in iTRACE: June solar insolation (SOLIN) at 45°N (orange), atmospheric CO 2  concentration (green) ( 70 ), and meltwater fluxes (MWF) in the Northern (black) and Southern (gray) hemispheres. ( B ) Deglacial GMSST as deviations from PI in iTRACE (red line; centennial mean) and proxy-based reconstructions (blue) ( 19 ,  20 ) and a reanalysis product (black) ( 31 ). Reconstructions of the LGM GMSST cooling from Tierney  et al.  ( 21 ) without (orange) and with data assimilation (DA) (green, with 95% confidence interval) and from Clark  et al.  ( 22 ) (purple) are also shown. Shading/error bars: 1σ uncertainty. ( C ) Deglacial GMOT as deviations from PI in iTRACE (red line; centennial mean) and our proxy-based global ocean temperature stack (orange line, Materials and Methods) as well as by noble gas–based GMOT reconstructions (blue) ( 7 ) in spline (line) and samples (dots) version. Also shown are DOT reconstructions for the last deglaciation (green squares) ( 15 ) and for the LGM mean (blue and gray triangles) ( 16 ,  23 ). Note that the LGM estimates in (B) and (C) represent averages over the LGM interval. ( D ) Ocean HSE in proxy reconstructions (blue) and in iTRACE (red). HSE is calculated as ∆GMOT/∆GMSST with a threshold of 0.1°C for both ∆GMSST and ∆GMOT (relative to the LGM state). For proxy-based HSE, GMSST is from Shakun  et al.  ( 19 ) and Marcott  et al.  ( 20 ), and GMOT is from Shackleton  et al.  ( 7 ). ppm, parts per million. These observations raise several questions: What mechanisms are responsible for ocean heat uptake/storage and how large can the ocean HSE be? In particular, the mechanisms responsible for the large HSE during the last deglaciation ( Fig. 1D ) are puzzling. Given the large volume of deep and abyssal waters (below 2000 m), the conventional view in paleoceanography is that warming of their source waters in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic ( 17 ,  24 – 26 ) would lead to a large increase in GMOT since the LGM. During the last deglaciation, however, proxy records suggest these source waters, especially those for the Antarctic Bottom water, were largely covered by sea ice in winter ( 27 ,  28 ) when deep water forms, such that their temperatures should have remained near the freezing point (~−1.8°C). We would thus expect a much weaker warming of the deep ocean than the surface ocean during the last deglaciation with an HSE much less than 1. Here, we combine a transient climate simulation from the LGM to mid-Holocene (MH; 6 ka) with new proxy-based DOT reconstructions to show that the deglacial ocean heat storage is enhanced in intermediate-depth waters in response to increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) and retreating ice sheets as well as reductions in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) forced by meltwater. The resulting strong warming at these depths then substantially increases ocean HSE throughout the last deglaciation."
131,results,"RESULTS Enhanced deglacial ocean heat storage by warming of intermediate waters To understand the deglacial ocean HSE, we first examine results from our isotope-enabled TRAnsient Climate Evolution (iTRACE) simulation which was performed using the Community Earth System Model version 1.3 (iCESM1) ( 29 ). The simulation was forced by reconstructed ice sheets, solar insolation associated with orbital configurations (ORB), GHGs, and meltwater fluxes (MWF) (Materials and Methods) ( 30 ). Starting from the LGM, our simulated GMSST and GMOT both increase by ~2.5°C during HS1, plateau during the Bølling-Allerød (14.7 to 12.9 ka), and then increase again by ~1°C during the YD before reaching the relatively stable Holocene state, corresponding to an ocean HSE of ~1 for the LGM-MH transition ( Fig. 1, B to D ). These changes in the timing and magnitude of GMSST and GMOT largely follow proxy reconstructions ( Fig. 1, B and C ) ( 7 ,  16 – 18 ,  19 – 22 ) and a reanalysis product ( 31 ). The comparable deglacial (MH-LGM) changes of GMOT and GMSST (i.e., HSE of ~1) is robust across climate models as shown in another transient deglacial simulation TraCE-21k (Materials and Methods) ( 32 ), a series of time-slice equilibrium simulations for the last deglaciation ( 33 ), and equilibrium simulations in most Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3) models ( 34 ) and in iCESM1, regardless of their differing climate sensitivities (fig. S1 and table S1). Our model results show that the pattern of deglacial warming in the ocean interior is far from uniform ( Fig. 2  and fig. S2A). As expected, we find that the global zonal mean MH-LGM temperature change in the abyss is indeed smaller than GMSST change ( Fig. 2A ) due to source waters being largely covered by sea ice ( Fig. 3A ). The interior warming is instead dominated by a core region of intermediate waters (300 to 1500 m) extending northward across the equator from the Southern Ocean, where the warming is greater than the GMSST warming by up to two times. This intermediate-depth warming occurs primarily in the Indo-Pacific Oceans which account for ~70% of the global ocean volume ( Fig. 2B  and fig. S2B). A secondary core region of warming occurs at intermediate to mid-depths (300 to 3000 m) around the northern subpolar region ( Fig. 2A ) which is caused predominantly by warming in the Atlantic sector ( Fig. 2C ). While cores of warming in the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic reach different depths, these cores are related in that they both represent the depth of penetration of intermediate/deep water masses sourced at the surface in these regions. The overall warming of the global ocean is stronger than GMSST warming in the upper half of the ocean but similar to or weaker than GMSST warming in the lower half of the ocean, with the resulting GMOT warming being comparable to that of GMSST (HSE of ~1;  Fig. 1D ). A similar vertical structure of warming with an even greater amplitude can also be seen at some other times, notably at HS1 (relative to LGM) with a greater warming contribution from the Atlantic sector ( Fig. 2, D to F ), corresponding to an HSE greater than 1 ( Fig. 1D ). Last, this ocean warming pattern of MH-LGM, accompanied by the large HSE, is also robust across most PMIP3 models (fig. S3 and table S1; Materials and Methods). Fig. 2. Simulated and reconstructed deglacial subsurface temperature changes. ( A  to  C ) Normalized zonal mean ocean temperature change between the MH (6.5 to 6 ka mean) and LGM (20 to 19 ka mean) states (T*, divided by MH-LGM GMSST change) in the global ocean (A), Indo-Pacific (B), and Atlantic (C). Contours in (A) show overturning stream function in the MH (interval of 4 Sv). ( D  to  F ) As (A) to (C) but for HS1 (16 to 15 ka mean) minus LGM.

Note that the classification of water depths used in (G) and (H) are approximate since the sites are arranged not only by depth but also by latitude to assess the simulated pattern. Fig. 3. Simulated deglacial surface temperature changes. ( A ) Changes between the MH-LGM in annual mean SAT (green contour, interval of 5°C) and annual mean SST (color shading, °C).

Also shown in (B) and (C) are temperature changes in a reanalysis product (dashed lines) ( 31 ). Although existing global DOT ( 15 ) and GMOT ( 7 ) proxy reconstructions support a large deglacial ocean HSE ( Fig. 1D ), they are unable to constrain the vertical temperature structure simulated in iTRACE ( Fig. 2, A to C ). We addressed this issue by reconstructing deglacial ∆DOT from 119 globally distributed, well-dated benthic δ 18 O (δ 18 O b ) records archived in the Ocean Circulation and Carbon Cycling (OC3) database ( Fig. 2, B and C ) (Materials and Methods) ( 35 ). The site depths provided with the records cover intermediate to abyssal waters. We derived ∆DOT by accounting for changes in the δ 18 O of seawater (δ 18 O sw ) associated with the decrease in global ice volume. Independently derived ∆DOT reconstructions that are available at several of our sites show similar changes as in our reconstructions (fig. S4). We also find that our basin-weighted global mean ∆DOT (∆GMDOT) stack is in good agreement with the noble gas–based ∆GMOT reconstructions ( Fig. 1C ), consistent with a recent assessment of the temperature and land ice seawater contributions to the global δ 18 O b  record (Materials and Methods) ( 7 ). This agreement at local and global scales suggests that any effects of hydrographic changes on δ 18 O sw  were negligible (Materials and Methods). To assess the vertical temperature structure simulated by iTRACE, we constructed regional ∆DOT stacks from sites occurring in the areas where simulated ocean temperatures show lesser, similar, or greater amounts of change than GMSST ( Fig. 2, B and C ). The zonal plots in  Fig. 2  identify the simulated vertical temperature changes between the MH and LGM ( Fig. 2, A to C ) and HS1 and LGM ( Fig. 2, D to F ). Overall, the iTRACE stacks follow the reconstructed deglacial temperature evolution, although temperature variations at intermediate depths caused by AMOC reductions are overestimated in amplitude in the model (fig. S5). In the Atlantic basin, the regional stack showing the greatest warming corresponds to the area of greatest simulated warming, in the intermediate to mid-depths (generally <3000 m and >0°). Here, warming above ∆GMDOT begins at the start of HS1 with the subsequent temperature evolution exhibiting pronounced millennial-scale variability ( Fig. 2H ). The regional stack representing the remaining Atlantic basin north of 30°S is consistent with iTRACE in showing less warming beyond the core region of greatest warming. Our stacks from the Pacific basin similarly support the vertical structure in the iTRACE simulation, with greater warming than ∆GMDOT at intermediate depths (<1500 m), little difference at mid-depths, and less warming than ∆GMDOT in the abyss ( Fig. 2G ). Further support for this vertical temperature structure is suggested from regional δ 18 O b  stacks constructed in ( 36 ), with sites from 1000 to 2000 m depth being consistently lighter (i.e., warmer) than deeper sites (fig. S6). We thus conclude that the data support the iTRACE finding that the large HSE is caused by strong warming in the intermediate-depth waters. Enhanced deglacial HSE by GHGs and ice sheet forcing Here, we show that substantial warming of intermediate-depth waters can be dynamically related to surface warming in response to GHGs and ice sheet forcing. In iTRACE, annual SSTs warm globally from the LGM to the MH except in the polar regions, with the greatest SST warming (~6°C) centered on ~50°S in the southern oceans and ~45°N in the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans ( Fig. 3, A and B ). A similar surface pattern is seen in proxy data ( 37 – 39 ), combined data-model (data assimilation) reanalysis ( Fig. 3, B and C ) ( 31 ,  40 ,  41 ), and PMIP3 model simulations (fig. S7). The deglacial SST warming pattern is forced primarily by increasing GHGs and retreating Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets. This is demonstrated by the strong similarity of the SST warming pattern in iTRACE ( Fig. 3, A and B ) and in the sensitivity experiment forced just by ice sheets, orbital forcing, and GHGs [continental ice sheets (ICE) + ORB + GHG] (Materials and Methods) (fig. S8). Radiative forcing from GHGs causes global surface warming that is characterized by polar amplification toward both poles in surface air temperature (SAT) ( Fig. 3, A and C , and fig. S8, D and F) ( 42 ). However, at high latitudes in both hemispheres, the ocean surface is largely covered by sea ice, especially in the cold season (fig. S9) when deep water masses are formed by deep convection, such that SSTs remain around the freezing point with little change during the deglaciation ( Fig. 3, A and B , and figs. S8 and S9). This leads to peak SST warming in the mid-to-subpolar latitudes, in contrast to the peak SAT warming toward both poles. In the North Atlantic, warming of newly exposed surface waters in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas forms another SST warming peak of 6°C at ~60°N ( Fig. 3, A and B , and figs. S7 to S9). At the same time, the lowered elevation and reduced albedo of retreating NH ice sheets induce surface warming over NH continents which is then advected downstream to the North Atlantic and North Pacific, enhancing peak SST warming at 45°N ( Fig. 3, A and B , and fig. S10, D to F). This response is confirmed by the sensitivity experiment ICE which is forced only by ice sheet change (fig. S10 and Materials and Methods). Peak SST warming at these latitudes is then ventilated into the ocean interior (fig. S8, A to C) mainly by the mean subduction ( 43 ,  44 ), forming the maximum subsurface warming centered in the intermediate waters, primarily in the Antarctic Intermediate Water. The deeper warming in the North Atlantic associated with the mean North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation does not contribute substantially to the GMOT change due to its small volume (fig. S8). Notably, the strong SST warming remains colocated with strong ventilation regions throughout the deglaciation (fig. S11) and highly correlated with heat flux into the ocean in mid-latitude, wind-driven subduction regions, thus enhancing the intermediate ocean heat storage ( 43 ). Even with homogeneous surface warming, as the deep-water formation sites are largely ice covered, the intermediate water masses will enhance the HSE because they represent the main remaining pathway of ventilating the global ocean. Last, our sensitivity experiments show that orbital forcing has only a minor effect on global ocean temperature change during the last deglaciation ( Fig. 4B ). Fig. 4. Simulated and reconstructed deglacial evolution of AMOC and ocean temperature changes. ( A ) AMOC transport simulated in iTRACE (red) and implied in observed  231 Pa/ 230 Th from Bermuda Rise sediments (black) ( 46 ). ( B ) GMSST (dotted line) and GMOT (solid line) change (°C, relative to the LGM state) in iTRACE (ICE + ORB + GHG + MWF) and the other three factorized-forcing sensitivity experiments. ( C ) As (B) but for ocean HSE. HSE is calculated as ∆GMOT/∆GMSST with a threshold of 0.1°C for both ∆GMSST and ∆GMOT (both relative to the LGM state). Enhanced deglacial HSE by AMOC weakening Although we find substantial warming of intermediate waters by surface warming associated with GHGs and ice sheet forcing, our sensitivity experiments demonstrate that reaching an ocean HSE of ≥1 throughout the early deglaciation requires additional subsurface warming that is caused by weakening of the AMOC in response to meltwater forcing ( Fig. 4 ). Paleoceanographic proxies and modeling studies suggest that meltwater forcing from NH ice sheets impeded NADW formation during HS1 and the YD, causing a reduction in the AMOC ( Fig. 4A ;  32 ,  45 ,  46 ). In response to the weakened AMOC, the northward heat transport was reduced, forming the SST bipolar seesaw pattern of NH cooling and SH warming ( Fig. 3, D to F , and figs. S12A and S13A) ( 19 ,  32 ,  47 – 52 ). This SST pattern does not change GMSSTs substantially because the NH SST response nearly cancels the opposite SH SST response, as shown by the small increase in GMSST during HS1 and the YD that accompanied an AMOC reduction (~0.5°C; comparing iTRACE with ICE + ORB + GHG) ( Fig. 4, A and B ). Furthermore, the small GMSST change caused by the AMOC reduction quickly disappears after the end of the meltwater forcing, as seen in GMSSTs being nearly the same after 10 ka in the experiments with (iTRACE) and without (ICE + ORB + GHG) meltwater forcing, such that there is little net effect of meltwater forcing on GMSST in the MH ( Fig. 4B ). In contrast to this GMSST response, a reduction of the AMOC generates a longer-term subsurface warming in both hemispheres. For example, during HS1, the reduced North Atlantic deep convection reduces the vertical mixing between colder surface and warmer subsurface waters, resulting in a cooling in the North Atlantic surface but a warming in the subsurface, which is a robust feature in reconstructions ( 50 – 52 ) and model simulations ( 32 ,  53 ,  54 ). The warming signal propagates southward along the Deep Western Boundary Current into the South Atlantic in hundreds of years, before leaking northward into other basins via the Southern Ocean ( 55 ). This leads to strong subsurface warming that extends to mid-depths over much of the global ocean that persists throughout HS1 ( Figs. 2, D to F , and  4B  and figs. S12 and S13) ( 55 ). The strong subsurface warming may have also warmed abyssal waters through circulation and mixing processes (figs. S12E and S13E). In iTRACE, the weakening AMOC throughout HS1 contributes 2°C warming to GMOT, while the other combined forcings contribute another 0.5°C warming ( Fig. 4B ). A similar AMOC-related GMOT warming also occurs during the YD but with a smaller magnitude due to its shorter duration ( Fig. 4, A and B ). As such, during the early deglaciation, nearly 50% (1.8°C) of the total simulated GMOT increase (3.4°C) is contributed by the AMOC reduction ( Fig. 4B ). By comparison, the HSE in the ICE + ORB + GHG experiment increases monotonically from ~0.2 during HS1 to ~0.9 during the MH ( Fig. 4C ), reflecting a weaker ocean interior warming from the LGM to MH than in iTRACE ( Fig. 2, A to C , versus fig. S8, A to C). Given its small effect on GMSST but strong and long-term effect on GMOT, a decreased AMOC is thus highly effective in enhancing the HSE during the entire deglaciation, with particularly large increases during HS1 and the YD ( Figs. 1D  and  4C ). Moreover, in iTRACE, the heat accumulated in the global ocean by the AMOC reduction lasts for >4000 years after the termination of major meltwater forcing ( Fig. 1A ), with a notable residual of 0.5°C in ∆GMOT persisting until the MH ( Fig. 4B )."
132,discussion,"DISCUSSION Our iTRACE simulations and new proxy reconstructions of ∆DOT demonstrate that the deglacial ocean HSE was substantially enhanced by subsurface warming at intermediate depths through the effects of increasing GHGs and retreating ice sheets on surface warming as well as by a weakening of the AMOC in response to meltwater forcing. We emphasize several implications of these results to our understanding of changes in MOT. First, we note that the warming in the Indo-Pacific Ocean around 2000 m is closest to the global mean value (fig. S2B), suggesting that reconstructions of past ∆DOT from similar locations would closely monitor ∆GMOT. Second, our results showing that millennial-scale AMOC variability and its lingering effect on ocean warming substantially enhanced ocean HSE to >1 suggest that persistent AMOC variability throughout a glacial cycle would do the same, whereas reduced variability would cause HSE to be <1. Third, our analyses suggest that different patterns of surface warming associated with different timescales may cause a substantially different ocean HSE. For example, maximum ocean heat uptake today is occurring at mid-latitudes ( 5 ), but under the short-term anthropogenic forcing, the dominant large-scale surface warming is found in subtropical latitudes ( 43 ,  56 ), which dominates the GMSST change given the large surface area of the subtropical ocean. Because transmission of this subtropical warming to depth is limited by the shallow subtropical cell and can only warm to depths <500 m, it has damped ocean heat uptake efficiency ( 43 ) and thus contributed little to enhancing HSE at this early stage, leading to an HSE of <<1 (fig. S14). On millennial and longer (near-equilibration) timescales such as during the last deglaciation, if we assume that areas of strong surface warming remained colocated with globally dominant ventilation regions in mid- to subpolar latitudes like in iTRACE, then we should expect ventilation of the thicker intermediate-depth waters to enhance HSE. As a result, the ocean will sequester more heat from the atmosphere, potentially slowing the rate of atmospheric warming. Our study therefore suggests that the pattern effect not only influences climate sensitivity through atmospheric feedbacks ( 57 ) but also influences ocean heat uptake/storage and its efficiency which can substantially modulate transient climate change ( 58 ) and the Earth’s energy budget ( 59 ). In the future, if global warming continues as in the case of the longer-term (centennial to millennial timescale) warming investigated by Rugenstein  et al.  ( 10 ), the HSE could be further enhanced (fig. S14) as the strong surface warming extends further poleward to subpolar latitudes where winter sea ice coverage will be substantially reduced."
133,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Proxy ∆DOT records We reconstructed deglacial ∆DOT from 119 globally distributed, well-dated benthic δ 18 O (δ 18 O b ) records. We selected 108 of these records from the 287 records that are archived in the OC3 database ( 35 ) based on their resolution and  14 C age control. We also used the following δ 18 O b  records that are not in the OC3 database: ENAM93-21 ( 60 ), EW9302-24GGC ( 61 ), EW9302-25GGC ( 61 ), EW9302-26GGC ( 61 ), EW9302-2JPC ( 50 ), MD95-2010 ( 62 ), RAPID-10-1P ( 62 ), U1308 ( 62 ), KNR166-2-26JPC ( 63 ), KNR197-3-46CDH ( 63 ), and M35003-4 ( 64 ). The average resolution of the 119 records is 520 ± 290 years, with 80 records having a resolution <600 years, and we interpolated all data to a 500-year resolution to reflect the average resolution of the data. Age models of all records used here are based on calibrated  14 C ages as opposed to some records in the database with age models derived by alignment to the LR04 δ 18 O b  stack. For most records, where the age models of records are based on several  14 C calibration schemes, we used the one based on the most recent calibration. For the following cores, we used the earlier Jonkers age model in the OC3 database as it was more consistent with other constraints: ODP-162-984, GIK23415_9, and SO213-2-82-1. Benthic δ 18 O records (δ 18 O b ) reflect some combination of the temperature of foraminifera calcification (δ 18 O T ) and the δ 18 O of seawater (δ 18 O sw ), which in turn reflects global land ice volume and salinity. We derived δ 18 O T  by subtracting changes in δ 18 O sw  associated with the decrease in global ice volume from δ 18 O b  and assessed possible additional salinity contributions by comparison to independently derived temperature reconstructions (see below). We used the LGM constraints of a 1‰ increase in δ 18 O sw  as established by pore water measurements in deep-sea cores ( 65 ) and a sea-level lowering of −134 m ( 66 ) to derive the relationship 0.0075‰ m −1  and applied it to a modeled sea-level reconstruction for the last 21 kyr ( 66 ). The uncertainties on these constraints are small, and so we do not propagate them into our results as they would not affect our conclusions. We then converted the resulting δ 18 O T  to temperature (∆DOT) using the calibration from Marchitto  et al.  ( 67 ) for  Cibicidoides  ( n  = 118) and  Uvigerina  ( n  = 1): T  = [0.245–SQRT (0.045461 + 0.0044 δ 18 O T )]/0.0022. The ∆DOT time series was then normalized to 20 ka. We calculated the uncertainty on individual site records through a Monte Carlo simulation by using the average uncertainty (300 years) of the calibrated age models at each time interval (0 to 20 ka at 500-year resolution). We generated 1000 age models for each site by randomly adding or subtracting a Gaussian distribution of 300 years to each time interval and then created 1000 temperature records using the 1000 random age models. We then took the average and SD (1σ) of the 1000 temperature records to calculate the Monte Carlo version of our temperature record. To assess the vertical temperature structure simulated by iTRACE, we constructed regional ∆DOT stacks from sites occurring in the areas where simulated ocean temperatures show lesser, similar, or greater amounts of change than GMSST ( Fig. 2, B to F ). We used the jackknife procedure to recalculate each regional stack 1000 times after randomly removing 50% of the records in each iteration, with the SD of the resulting stacks being taken as the 1σ age uncertainty. We applied an analytical uncertainty of 0.04‰ to each stack, converted to temperature using 0.25 ‰ °C −1  ( 68 ), resulting in an uncertainty of 0.16°C. Similarly, we applied a δ 18 Osw error of 0.1‰ ( 65 ) to each stack corresponding to a 0.4°C uncertainty. We summed these uncertainties in quadrature to derive the total uncertainty on each regional stack. We also calculated regional ∆DOT stacks and their uncertainties (as described above) for the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (there are no data from the Southern Ocean), weighted each by the respective volume of their ocean basins and normalized relative to the total ocean volume (26 and 74%, respectively) (fig. S2B), and then stacked them to generate the ∆GMDOT stack. Similarly, to generate the global stack uncertainty, we weighted the jackknife regional uncertainties for each regional stack and added these in quadrature to the δ 18 O b  analytical error of 0.16°C and the δ 18 Osw of porewater error of 0.4°C to derive the uncertainty on the entire stack. We find that independently derived ∆DOT reconstructions that are available at several of our sites show similar changes as in our reconstructions (fig. S4). Given our inferred contribution of δ 18 O sw  from global ice sheets, this agreement suggests a negligible contribution from local salinity changes at these sites. We also find that our basin-weighted ∆GMDOT stack is in good agreement with the noble gas–based ∆GMOT reconstructions ( Fig. 1C ). Shackleton  et al.  ( 7 ) converted the noble gas–based ∆GMOT reconstructions to δ 18 O T  and estimated the δ 18 O sw  component from land ice as Δδ 18 O ice volume  = δ 18 O ice /(D/ΔSL − 1), where δ 18 O ice  is their assumed mean ice sheet δ 18 O (−30 ± 2‰), D is the modern mean ocean depth, and ΔSL is the global sea-level change from Lambeck  et al.  ( 66 ). When applied to the last deglaciation, Δδ 18 O ice volume  is 1.02‰ at 20 ka or the same as the pore water reconstruction ( 65 ) used here. Summing their δ 18 O T  and Δδ 18 O reconstructions gave a δ 18 O record (predicted) that is the same, within uncertainty, as the LR04 δ 18 O b  record (observed) from 0 to 20 ka. The agreement of our independently derived global δ 18 O T  and δ 18 O sw  reconstructions with those in Shackleton  et al.  ( 7 ) thus indicates that any additional contribution from salinity changes at the global scale is negligible. Model and simulations iTRACE is a transient simulation of global climate and water isotopes during the last deglaciation ( 30 ) conducted with iCESM1 ( 29 ). The resolution of atmosphere and land surface is a nominal 2° (1.9° in latitude and 2.5° in longitude) with 30 vertical levels in the atmosphere; the resolution of the ocean and sea ice is a nominal 1° with 60 vertical levels in the ocean. Starting from the LGM (20 ka), four forcing factors, namely, the ICE, solar insolation associated with ORB, GHG, and MWF, were applied additively to simulate the deglacial climate change. Continental ice sheet configuration following the ICE-6G reconstruction ( 69 ) was modified every 1000 year during the simulation. GHG concentrations (CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O) were prescribed based on ice core reconstructions ( 70 ). MWF was applied on the basis of sea-level reconstructions, largely following the scheme used in TraCE-21k ( 32 ). Assuming linearity of the responses, the difference between different pairs of the factorized-forcing simulations can be used to estimate the impact of each individual forcing approximately. For example, (ICE + ORB + GHG + MWT) − (ICE + ORB + GHG) isolates the effects of meltwater forcing (fig. S13). The set of iTRACE simulations have been shown to be able to reproduce many major features of the observed change of global climate and water masses during the early deglaciation (from 20 to 11 ka) ( 30 ,  55 ,  71 ). Here, we used the model output of 20 to 6 ka, which is now available. Besides iTRACE, another transient simulation TraCE-21k, the predecessor of iTRACE ( 32 ,  72 ), and multiple equilibrium model simulations are also investigated. TraCE-21k was performed with a lower-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Similar to iTRACE, TraCE-21k is also forced by deglacial changes in ice sheets, solar insolation, GHGs, and MWF and captures many important features of deglacial climate in its all forcing experiment ( 19 ,  32 ). More details of TraCE-21k simulation can be found in ( 72 ). For equilibrium simulations, we use “PI,” “MH,” and “LGM” simulations performed with iCESM1 and seven PMIP3 models ( 34 ). LongRunMIP simulations ( 10 ) are also investigated to show the long-term ocean HSE under future anthropogenic warming. Calculation of GMOT, GMSST, and AMOC intensity For model simulations, the three-dimensional ocean temperature fields are interpolated from their corresponding horizontal grids to 1° rectilinear latitude-longitude grids. The GMOT is calculated as the volume-weighted average over the entire ocean. GMSST is calculated as the area-weighted average over the ocean surface. Both GMOT and GMSST calculations use all ocean cells available including open sea cells and those covered by sea ice. AMOC intensity is defined as the maximum overturning stream function below 300 m over the section of 20° to 50°N in the Atlantic. Further model-data comparison A further temperature-salinity diagram comparison of sites from Adkins  et al.  ( 73 ) indicates that our iTRACE model faithfully reproduces the homogeneous glacial deep ocean temperature that around freezing point and larger deglacial warming (>4°C) in the deep Atlantic than in the deep Pacific and Southern Ocean (<2.5°C), similar to iTRACE ( Fig. 2, B and C ) and TraCE-21k ( 74 ). There are some model-data discrepancies. Compared with observations, the evolution of the simulated GMSST experiences sharper peaks and troughs that are related to strong AMOC variability ( Figs. 1B  and  4A ). This high-frequency surface temperature variability, however, has little imprint in the broad global ocean temperature change, as indicated by the consistent GMOTs in iTRACE and observations. For GMSST records, the absence of these sharp peaks and troughs can be caused, partly, by the low temporal resolution and chronology uncertainty. For PMIP3 models, we note that there are differences in the detailed ocean warming pattern, especially in the North Atlantic (fig. S3). This can be related to model differences in simulating the deep convection and the AMOC transport. Specifically, AMOC strength (relative to present day) at the LGM is highly uncertain among PMIP models ( 75 ,  76 ) which will influence the temperature response at the LGM. However, as the North Atlantic only occupies a small fraction in volume, such difference makes only little differences to GMOT change."

			 Introduction 
			 The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports vast amounts of energy to the northern high latitudes, playing a pivotal role in modulating the global climate 1 – 3 . Increasing lines of evidence indicate that the AMOC is declining over the modern climate record 4 – 7 , although debates persist 8 – 10 . Furthermore, numerical model simulations consistently project a slowdown or even collapse of the AMOC as a response to increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the 21st century, as summarized by the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) 11 . 
			 However, GHGs are not the only external factor influencing AMOC strength, and anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) have also been found to play an important role (Supplementary Fig.  1a ) 12 – 18 . Compared to the globally well-mixed GHGs, AAs are highly variable in space and time due to their short residence time in the atmosphere. In contrast to the monotonically increasing GHGs since the industrial revolution, there is a two-stage temporal evolution of the global mean AAs (Supplementary Fig.  1b ): prior to the late 1980s, the global mean AAs shows a monotonic increase due to ramping aerosol emissions from both the eastern and western hemispheres; after the early 1990s it remains stable due to a reversal of the emission trend in Europe and North America (an effect of the Clean Air Act). By contrast, the AAs emission over South and East Asia continues to increase. 
			 A growing number of literature recognizes the role of AAs in AMOC variations over the past century 12 – 18 . In particular, a multi-model of single-forcing simulations, known as the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) 19 , reveals a two-stage evolution of the AAs-induced AMOC change 15 : a monotonic steady strengthening before the mid-1990s and a rapid weakening thereafter (Supplementary Fig.  1a ). Since AAs are known to be an important radiative forcing that cools the global climate and drives an increase in the surface water density over the North Atlantic 18 , 20 , 21 , the AAs-induced AMOC decay in recent decades is presumably attributed to the decreased AAs emission over the adjacent North America and Europe 13 , 14 , 21 , 22 . In contrast, the increased AAs over the eastern hemisphere are anticipated to have a cooling effect, hypothetically strengthening the AMOC 17 . However, owing to their inhomogeneous spatial distributions 23 – 25 , changes in Asian AAs result in dynamic impacts on large-scale atmospheric circulations and have far-reaching effects on remote regions. A recent study, in particular, has demonstrated that increased Asian AAs can shift the westerly jet equatorward in the northern hemipshere 26 . However, the influence of the increased Asian AAs on the AMOC and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we find that far-field AAs over Asia weaken the AMOC despite local radiative cooling.

				 As discussed above, aerosol optical depth evolution is marked by a clear spatial contrast with a positive trend over the eastern hemisphere and a negative trend over the western hemisphere (Fig.  1a ), known as the zonal shift pattern of AAs emission 17 , 27 . To investigate the climatic effects of changes in eastern and western AAs changes, we perform idealized radiative perturbation experiments 17 , 28 , 29  using a widely adopted fully-coupled climate model—the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) (see “CESM1 model” in Methods), known for its ability to represent the main physical processes involved in AMOC variability 3 , 30 – 32 . Prior to the perturbation runs, we first integrate a 500-yr control (CTRL) by forcing the CESM1 with GHGs, AAs, and solar insolation fixed at the year 2000 levels. To mimic the radiative effect of the aerosol forcing, we separately reduce solar insolation by 10% over East Asia and South Asia (red box in Fig.  1a ) and North America and Europe (blue boxes in Fig.  1a ), hereafter referred to as EAST and WEST simulations, respectively. Assuming linearity, the sign of the response in WEST is reversed to mimic the radiative heating effect of the aerosol decrease after the 1980s. The annual-mean net radiative forcing amounts to ~30  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The model simulated AMOC index in  b ,  d  is obtained as the maximum of streamfunction between latitudes 25° N–75° N and between depths of 500 and 2000 m. The radiative cooling resulting from increased Asian AAs paradoxically drives an AMOC slowdown. 
				 According to paleoclimate proxy records and climate models, the AMOC exhibits decadal to multi-decadal variability 33 – 36 . To ensure that the simulated changes are not the result of internal variability, a total of ten 100-yr ensemble members are generated for each of the CTRL, EAST, and WEST experiments branching out from year 350 of CTRL, where each member is realized by adding a small random perturbation to the initial surface temperature in each realization. Since we focus on how increased Asian AAs and the associated radiative cooling affect the AMOC through exciting atmospheric teleconnections during the transient response stage, the main analyses shown in this study are based on the difference between years 1–40 of the ensemble perturbed runs and the corresponding 40 years of the ensemble CTRL. In addition, we provide an overview of the ensemble responses during the slow response phase averaged over years 51–100 in Supplementary Fig.  2 , and the consistency between the results averaged over the first 40 years and the last 50 years suggests a short response timescale of the AMOC to changes in AAs. 
			 
			 
				 Increased Asian aerosols weaken the AMOC 
				 It is somewhat surprising to see that the aerosol-induced cooling over Asia leads to a significant slowdown of the AMOC (Fig.  1b ). This slowdown includes a rapid decrease of ~2.7 Sv (1 Sv= \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

This result demonstrates that the simulated decline of the AMOC is a robust climate response and not related to internal climate variability. Regarding the temporal evolution of the AMOC response in the WEST (Fig.  1d ), as expected, the AMOC is weakened by ~1.4 Sv in the first four decades due to the warming effect of reduced AAs, and remains relatively stable around this value thereafter. Note that the magnitudes of both the transient and long-term responses of the AMOC in WEST are smaller than those in EAST, suggesting that the remote Asian forcing exerts an even stronger influence on the AMOC than the adjacent forcing over North America and Europe. 
				 The transient AMOC responses in density space (see “AMOC in density space” in Methods) in both EAST and WEST exhibit strikingly similar spatial patterns (Fig.  1 c,  e ). The reduction occurs in the lower limb of AMOC, between 36.80 and 37.00  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Our model experiments suggest that the simulated acceleration in AMOC weakening after the 1990s is likely a combined result of AAs changes in both the eastern and western hemispheres. While the radiative heating caused by aerosol reduction over North America and Europe weakening the AMOC is not surprising, the mechanism behind the AMOC slowdown induced by remote radiative cooling over Asia remains puzzling. Furthermore, the remote forcing appears to have an even stronger influence on the AMOC than the adjacent forcing surrounding the North Atlantic. Next, we will delve into the mechanisms behind the AMOC slowdown in EAST. 
			 
			 
				 Circumglobal teleconnection excited by increased Asian Aerosols 
				 The impact of Asian AAs-induced radiative cooling on the AMOC is conducted by exciting stationary Rossby wave patterns. Initially, the cooling effect leads to the suppression of local convection and the development of upper-level convergence over broad regions in India and China (Fig.  2a ), inducing quasi-stationary atmospheric planetary wave trains propagating poleward and eastward (Fig.  2b ), manifested as an equatorward shift of the westerly jet in the northern mid-latitudes (Fig.  2d ). The associated streamfunction anomalies predominantly exhibit zonal wavenumber 4-5, characterized by a few prominent centers over the Tibetan Plateau, North Pacific, North America, and western Europe, which are aligned within the waveguide of the westerly jet stream. This anomalous pattern of atmospheric circulation mainly occurs within the jet stream waveguide, resembling the well-known circumglobal teleconnection 37 , 38 . In this case, however, the centers for East Asia and the Indian regions are merged due to the idealized configuration of the radiative forcing, covering western, central, and eastern Asia. The circumglobal response triggered by the reduction in Asian AAs persists throughout the year (Supplementary Fig.  3a–d ), with its peak intensity occurring in summer, likely the result of the stronger convective feedback to external radiative forcing and hence a stronger diabatic wave source during the active Asian Monsoon season (i.e., summer) than winter (Supplementary Fig.  3e ).

The increased Asian AAs weaken the westerlies over the subpolar North Atlantic by exciting circumglobal stationary Rossby waves in the mid-latitudes. 
				 The temporal evolution of streamfunction anomalies along the mean path of the stationary wave shows that the teleconnection response emerges within a few months and stabilizes in the first few years (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). This suggests a relatively short timescale for the northern hemisphere atmospheric circulation to respond to changes in Asian AAs. On this time scale, the oceanic feedback to the atmospheric circulation is expected to have a secondary influence. The response of the atmospheric circulation is largely barotropic. Over the subpolar North Atlantic, the induced sea level pressure response is characterized by a year-round meridional dipole (Fig.  2c , colors and Supplementary Fig.  5 ), resembling the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Notably, there are positive pressure anomalies over Iceland and negative anomalies in lower latitudes. These sea level pressure anomalies correspond to a weakening and equatorward shift of the prevailing westerlies located to the south of Greenland (Fig.  2c , vectors). The equatorward shift of the westerly jet over the North Atlantic since the 1980s has been observed and simulated 23 , 39 , and a recent study has pinpointed the primary role of increased Asian AAs in driving this shift in purposefully designed experiments 26 , thus corroborating our findings. The next natural question is: How do these changes in atmospheric circulation weaken the AMOC? 
			 
			 
				 Suppressed westerly winds hinder the deep water formation 
				 Atmospheric circulation changes over the North Atlantic (especially North Atlantic Oscillation-related changes) have been proven important in transforming upper ocean waters into the densest class of the North Atlantic Deep Water 40 – 43 . To investigate the regional surface ocean drivers responsible for the reduced transport of lower limb waters (Fig.  1c ), we conduct a winter-time surface water mass transformation (WMT) analysis (see “Water mass transformation” in Methods). Climatologically, the partitioning of the total WMT during winter into different regions varies significantly across different density classes (Fig.  3a ). In particular, in the higher density range (>36.80  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

These climatological results agree well with previous modeling studies 44 , 45 . Although the contribution of the Labrador Sea to the mean deep convection may be overestimated in climate models 46 , recent studies suggested that long-term changes in the AMOC are still dominated by changes in deep convection in the Labrador Sea 45 , 47 .

				 To investigate the driving mechanism behind the WMT reduction, we analyze the response of surface density flux in different basins, which measures the changes in surface buoyancy due to heat and freshwater exchanges between the atmosphere and the ocean (see “Water mass transformation” in Methods) 48 . The reduced WMT almost entirely resulted from the suppressed heat loss in the surface Labrador Sea (Fig.  3c , also see Supplementary Fig.  6  for the negligible haline contribution), resulting in a more buoyant surface ocean that hinders the transformation of lighter upper waters into denser waters. By quantifying the thermally-driven WMT anomaly associated with different surface heat flux components, we find that the WMT reduction is mainly driven by reduced turbulent heat loss (also see Supplementary Fig.  7a-b  for their spatial patterns). Both latent and sensible heat fluxes contribute to the reduction in the Labrador Sea, with the former contributing  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				 The reduced turbulent heat flux over the Labrador Sea is primarily driven by the suppressed westerlies over the subpolar North Atlantic. The total turbulent heat flux changes (11.5  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				\begin{document}$$W{m}^{-2}$$\end{document} W m − 2 ) can be linked to changes in SST, surface wind speed, surface relative humidity, and air-sea temperature difference (see “Turbulent flux decomposition” in Methods). The largest contribution arises from the reduction in the air-sea temperature difference (7.8  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				\begin{document}$$W{m}^{-2}$$\end{document} W m − 2 ; Fig.  3d , second blue and yellow bars), which in turn can be attributed to the weakened surface westerlies south of Greenland (Fig.  2c ). Specifically, the suppressed surface wind reduces the transport of cold air from the upstream North American continent to the deep convection site, generating an anomalously warmer boundary air than the surface ocean, and thus inducing an anomalously zonal warm temperature advection over a substantial region of the Labrador Sea (Supplementary Fig.  7c–f ). Moreover, the reduction in wind speed also acts to warm the surface ocean by suppressing heat loss from latent and sensible heat fluxes (2.9  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				\begin{document}$$W{m}^{-2}$$\end{document} W m − 2 ; Fig.  3d , third blue and yellow bars). Therefore, the suppressed westerlies lead to a decrease in both air-sea temperature difference and surface wind speed, collectively hindering turbulent heat loss and impeding the deep water formation in the Labrador Sea (Fig.  4 ). Fig. 4 Schematic of the weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) due to increased anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) in Asia. Highlighted are the responses in the surface, upper troposphere, and ocean in EAST. Increased AAs emissions over South and East Asia (purple shading) reduce the solar insolation and suppress local convection (red arrows), igniting a circumglobal Rossby wave train (blue shading and black arrows) propagating eastward and poleward and an equatorward shift of jet stream (gray arrows). The barotropic atmospheric circulation changes generate a negative North Atlantic Oscillation-like sea level pressure anomaly in the subpolar North Atlantic (orange high pressure center and blue low pressure center), suppressing the prevailing westerlies south of Greenland (light blue arrows). Through reducing air-sea temperature difference and wind speed, the wind changes inject anomalous turbulent heat into the surface Labrador Sea (red arrows), inhibiting the production of dense water masses that make up the southward flowing limb of the AMOC, and thus resulting in a weaker and shallower AMOC (blue shading in the ocean). 
				 The rate of AMOC weakening slows down substantially as time progresses into the slow response stage (Fig.  1b ). Given that the AMOC is responsible for most of the heat transport in the Atlantic basin, its weakening results in reduced poleward oceanic heat transport (Supplementary Fig.  8a ). As a result, anomalously cold water (Supplementary Fig.  8b ) propagates downstream along the cyclonic subpolar gyre, eventually reaching the Labrador Sea. This process acts as a negative feedback, balancing the surface heat gain in the Labrador Sea and preventing further reduction of deep water formation. Consequently, this self-limited process helps slow down the weakening of the AMOC. 
			 
			 
				 Additional multi-model evidence confirming the Asian AAs-AMOC link 
				 The above responses in atmospheric teleconnection and surface-forced WMT identified for weakening the AMOC are behaviors expected from fundamental physical principles, but the results are based solely on the CESM1 model. It remains to be seen whether the main conclusion holds in different model settings. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive analysis including multi-model results and large-ensemble simulations to test the robustness of our findings. 
				 We use simulations from 10 models participating in the Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) 49 , which is a subset of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) dedicated to understanding the fast responses of the atmosphere to aerosol changes (see “CMIP6 and CESM2-SF-LE simulations” in Methods). We make use of two sets of AerChemMIP simulations, piClim-control and piClim-SO2, each spanning 30 years with fixed climatological mean SST and sea ice conditions corresponding to the pre-industrial levels. The only difference between these two sets of simulations is the emissions of anthropogenic aerosol precursors of SO 2 : while piClim-control employs preindustrial emissions fixed at 1850 levels, piClim-SO2 adopts emissions fixed at 2014 levels. Notably, due to the implementation of the Clean Air Act in Europe and North America, SO 2  emissions in the western hemisphere have already decreased significantly by 2014, making Asian emissions the predominant forcing in the piClim-SO2 simulations (Supplementary Fig.  9a , contours). Therefore, this 2014 sulfate forcing operates as a comparable agent to that used in our EAST simulations (Fig.  1a ), albeit being more concentrated in East Asia. 
				 To assess the transient responses of atmospheric circulation to Asian AAs, we calculate the difference between the piClim-SO2 ensemble and the piClim-control ensemble for years 1–30. Consistently, the AerChemMIP simulations show a similar atmospheric response pattern compared to our EAST simulations (Supplementary Fig.  9a , colors), especially the circumglobal teleconnection structure in the northern midlatitudes. The anomalous low-pressure centers of the teleconnection patterns in the AerChemMIP simulations are slightly shifted compared to those in our EAST simulations (Fig.  2b ), due possibly to the differences in the distribution of aerosol forcing. Nevertheless, the equatorward shift of the westerly jet and the negative NAO-like response are evident (Supplementary Fig.  9b ), accompanied by suppressed westerlies over the Labrador Sea. These agreements between the results of AerChemMIP and our CESM1 simulations provide support for the findings from our CESM1 simulations, adding confidence in the robustness of the atmospheric teleconnections excited by increased Asian AAs. However, the response of the AMOC is elusive in the AerChemMIP setting due to the absence of an active ocean model. 
				 Recognizing the limitations of AerChemMIP and the incapability of distinguishing the effects of aerosol changes between the eastern and western hemispheres in DAMIP experiments, we turn to the CESM2 Single Forcing Large Ensemble (CESM2-SF-LE). This ensemble extends its 15-member AAs-only simulations to the year 2050 under the shared socioeconomic pathways 3-7.0 scenario, referred to as SSP370-AAs simulations. In this scenario, Asian AAs emissions are projected to continue to increase in the future, while AAs in the western hemisphere show little change as they have already decreased to low levels (Supplementary Fig.  10b , contours). Consequently, the increased Asian AAs and the associated radiative cooling emerge as a dominant forcing during the period 2015 to 2050. This provides an analog to our EAST case (Fig.  1a ) and adds some model diversity to our analysis. 
				 Consistent with our EAST case, the SSP370-AAs simulations also show a circumglobal teleconnection structure and a negative NAO-like trend in the atmospheric circulation (Supplementary Fig.  10b–d ). In addition, the weakened westerlies over the Labrador Sea lead to a reduction in heat loss through changes in turbulent fluxes, ultimately resulting in a weakening of the AMOC. In particular, the AMOC weakening also exhibits two distinct timescales (Supplementary Fig.  10a ): an initial rapid decline followed by a relatively slower rate of change. Such an alignment of these results suggests that the relationship between Asian AAs and the AMOC is not unique to CESM1, lending more support to our conclusion that the increased Asian AAs can weaken the AMOC.

			 Discussion 
			 In this work, we find that the increased Asian AAs, despite causing a radiative cooling, drive a weakening of the AMOC. This finding is corroborated by the analysis of AerChemMIP and CESM2-SF-LE experiments with similar AA forcings. The pathway of this effect of Asian AAs starts with suppressed convection over South and East Asia, which excites a Rossby wave train propagating eastward and poleward. The barotropic atmospheric circulation anomaly generates a negative North Atlantic Oscillation-like response and suppresses westerly winds south of Greenland, which hinders the transformation of upper ocean waters in the Labrador Sea via turbulent heat fluxes and ultimately leads to the slowdown of the AMOC. A recent study 17  employing a similar experimental setting has reported a contrasting result that increased Asian AAs could enhance the AMOC. The forcing in their experiment is placed over Siberia, and the induced cooling is potentially advected downstream to the subpolar North Atlantic by the mean westerlies, resulting in surface ocean cooling and thus AMOC strengthening. By contrast, in our study, the aerosol forcing located at lower latitudes affects the AMOC by inducing a circumglobal Rossby wave train. The contrasting result underscores high sensitivity to the location of the forcing 29 . Our discovery of a link between increased Asian AAs and a weakened AMOC suggests that the combined effects of increased AAs in Asia and decreased AAs in North America and West Europe, which represent the most consequential changes in aerosol emissions over the past few decades, conspire to contribute to the slowdown of the AMOC, with the decreased Asian AAs having a larger effect.

140,introduction,"Introduction The last glacial period (71–11.7 thousand years ago, ka) shows pronounced millennial-scale (~1–10 kyr) variability in ocean circulation and global climate, widely identified in Greenland ice cores 1 , speleothems records 2 , and marine sediment cores 3 – 5 . In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the counterparts to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) abrupt warmings (so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger; DO events) are known as the Antarctic Isotope Maxima (AIM) and exhibit more gradual, smaller-amplitude changes 6 , 7 . For this glacial millennial-scale climate variability, the concept of a bipolar seesaw was established, describing a thermal asynchrony between both hemispheres related to the dynamics of the global ocean overturning circulation 8 – 10 . Beyond the last glacial cycle and the stratigraphic range covered by Greenland ice cores, sediment records documenting millennial-scale climatic changes across several glacial cycles are mostly restricted to the NH 2 , 5 , 11 – 15 , in comparison to only a few SH records 16 , 17 . The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), located in the Southern Ocean between 40° and 60°S is the largest current system on Earth 18 . It is driven by atmospheric forcing 19  including the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) 20 , bathymetry, and ocean density gradients originating from surface, intermediate and deep ocean temperature and salinity changes 19 . Connecting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins, the ACC interlinks the various shallow to deeper southern water masses 18 , 19 , thereby regulating the exchange with the global deep ocean 19 , 20 . The ACC is a crucial component in the global carbon budget 18  and exerts a major influence on the global uptake of anthropogenic heat and carbon dioxide 21 . The major bathymetric constriction of the ACC occurs at the Drake Passage (DP). Complementing the so-called warm-water route that connects the Indian and Atlantic oceans (i.e., Agulhas leakage), the cold-water route connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through the DP. Over the last glacial period, substantial millennial-scale fluctuations in DP throughflow 22  and in the Agulhas leakage 23 , as well as Southern Ocean warming 24 , 25  have been suggested as possible triggers of DO events, through regulating the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Therefore, it is crucial to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of millennial-scale dynamics in the Southern Ocean in order to assess its role within the climate system. Except for Antarctic ice core records 17 , longer paleorecords with millennial-scale resolution covering multiple glacial cycles are not yet available from the SH. Consequently, our knowledge about the presence and recurrence of such SH millennial-scale variability in earlier parts of the Earth’s Quaternary history is limited. Here, we present high-resolution sedimentological and geochemical records obtained from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1542 (52°42.29ʹS, 75°35.77ʹ W; 1,101 m water depth, Fig.  1 ) 26 . The site is located ~30 nautical miles off the Chilean coast within the central part of the Cape Horn Current (CHC), which flows along the Chilean continental margin towards the DP 27 – 29 . The CHC originates from the bifurcation of subantarctic water masses of the South Pacific Current (SPC) approaching the Chilean coast around ~45°S 28 , 29  (Fig.  1 , Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The CHC is ∼100–150-km wide, flows along the Chilean margin southward parallel to the Northern Boundary (NB 30 ) of the ACC, and merges with the main ACC flow close to Cape Horn 27 , 29  (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The southern CHC is considered as part of the ACC system 27 , whereas the northern section is partly influenced by lower latitude forcings 27 , 31 . Fig. 1 Regional modern ocean hydrography and location of cores discussed in the study. Map of the Drake Passage region with mean annual sea surface temperature from the World Ocean Atlas (based on 2005–2017 average observations) 75 . Yellow dots mark sediment core locations and the red dot indicates the location of the main record introduced in this study. MD07-3128 is located at the same location as Site U1542. White transparent arrows are schematic representations of major surface currents; the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the South Pacific Current (SPC), the Cape Horn Current (CHC), the Humboldt Current (HC), and the Malvinas Current (MC). Dashed lines represent altimetry-derived ACC fronts 30 ; Northern Boundary (NB), Subantarctic Front (SAF), Polar Front (PF), and Southern ACC front (SACCF). Maps were created in Ocean Data View 76 . The ~250-m-long composite record covers the past 790 kyr with an average sedimentation rate of ~30 cm/kyr (see methods for details on the age model). During glacial periods, enhanced hinterland discharge contributed to an increased supply of terrigenous sediment, resulting in a bulk accumulation rate of up to five times higher compared to interglacial periods, consistent with earlier records from the region 26 , 32 . We focus on reconstructions of sea surface temperature (SST) using alkenone palaeothermometry 14 , 32 – 35  and near bottom current strength based on the X-ray fluorescence core scanner data (zirconium to rubidium ratio; Zr/Rb) calibrated with sortable silt data 4 , 22 , 36 , 37 . Both SST and current strength reconstructions have been successfully applied in that region 4 , 22 , 33 , 37 . Our study extends the existing sediment records from the nearby previous piston core MD07-3128 that reach back to ~60 ka 4 , 26 , 33 . Together, these records allow to explore orbital and millennial-scale climate variability of the CHC at the entrance of the DP across the Late Pleistocene in unprecedented detail."
141,results,"Results and discussion SST and current strength reconstructions at the southern Chilean margin We obtained alkenone-based SSTs from 929 samples at an average temporal resolution of ~700 years (Fig.  2c ). Holocene SSTs reach up to ~11.5 °C during the early Holocene, and gradually decrease to ~9.6 °C during the late Holocene. This is ~1.5 °C above the modern mean annual SST attributed to a likely seasonal bias of the alkenone-derived SSTs at the southern Chilean margin 38 . Over the past 790 kyr, the reconstructed SST at Site U1542 range from ~3 °C during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; sensu lato 18–28 ka), Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7 d (~275 ka), MIS 11b (~390 ka) to more than 12 °C during MIS 5e, MIS 7e and MIS 9e (Fig.  2 ). The mean glacial to interglacial (G/IG) temperature difference at glacial terminations is ~6 °C from 0 to 430 ka and ~4 °C before 430 ka. The transitions into glacial periods are marked by strong and abrupt coolings ranging from ~3 to ~8 °C. We observe persistent and high-amplitude SST variability of ~1–3 °C on millennial timescales during glacial periods across all eight glacial periods recorded at Site U1542.

Timing and nomenclature of Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) follow Lisiecki and Raymo 77  and glacial periods are blue shaded. MBT corresponds to the Mid-Brunhes Transition 55 . To assess the relationship between our SST record and the strength of the CHC, we reconstructed the near-bottom current speed using an extension of the classical sortable silt proxy 36 , which includes the fine sand fraction (sortable silt/fine sand or SSFS 22 , see methods and Supplementary Fig.  4 ). The calculated flow speeds depend on the sensitivity of the grain size to the bottom-current flow speed which may partly depend on local conditions such as bathymetry and seafloor morphology. Site U1542 is located on the upper continental slope within small-scale sediment drift 26  and documents a sedimentary sequence consisting mostly of siliciclastic sediments. Ice-rafted debris (IRD) supply has been reported at the site (core MD07-3128) for the last glacial period 33  when the western Patagonian ice sheet (PIS) extended to the continental shelf in southern Chile 39 , 40 . High siliciclastic sediment accumulation rates at Site U1542 dilute the IRD supply and thus do not substantially affect the SSFS 41 . This is supported by grain size analyses highlighting the absence of correlation and therefore independent fluctuations between the mean SSFS and the size-fraction commonly mainly dominated by IRD (Supplementary Fig.  4e ). Supplementary Fig.  4b  shows that mean SSFS and the weight percentage of the SSFS component are positively correlated, providing strong evidence for primarily current-controlled grain size changes within the silt-fine sand fraction 42 . Downslope processes may also exert some influence on fine grain size distributions during peak glacials intervals, when finer grain sizes might be influenced by glaciofluvial sediment supply from the proximal PIS (Supplementary Fig.  4f ). We use the discrete SSFS measurements from grain-size analyses for calibrating the XRF-based Zr/Rb count ratio in order to obtain high-resolution CHC strength records. The excellent correlation between SS and Zr/Rb ( R 2  = 0.80) indicates that both are reliable indicators of bottom current speed at the southern Chilean margin 4  and the DP (Supplementary Fig.  4a ). Our current strength reconstruction shows high values during the Holocene, interglacial MIS 5, 7, 9, 11, and 15 with mean SSFS values of ~50 µm, corresponding to a mean current velocities of ~16.5 cm/s (Supplementary Fig.  4i ) 41 . Maximum velocities of ~20 cm/s occur during peak interglacials and correspond to 120% of the interglacial mean (Fig.  2b ). MIS 13 and MIS 17 show weaker bottom currents of ~42 cm/s (80%, Fig.  2b ). CHC strength was significantly reduced during glacial (<10 cm/s, translating to ~50–60% weaker flow compared to the mean interglacials (Fig.  2b ). This reduction is similar to previous estimates in the Chilean margin 4  and in the central DP at the Polar Front during the last glacial period 22 , and in the central South Pacific 43  (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). However, less reduction is observed at the Pacific entrance of the DP based on deep ocean site PS97/093 (6–16% reduction, Fig.  2a ) 37 . Similar to the SST changes, the Site U1542 CHC strength reconstruction exhibits pronounced millennial-scale variability with amplitudes of ~2 to 6 cm/s, that persists across all glacial stages. Altogether, our SST and CHC strength reconstructions underline the exceptional palaeoceanographic sensitivity of the Chilean margin and provide a unique opportunity to explore in detail millennial-scale changes of the SH during G/IG cycles. Sensitivity of the eastern South Pacific to orbital and millennial-scale climate variability The SST record at Site U1542 shows dominant spectral power at the eccentricity (100-kyr) band. Additionally, small amplitude spectral peaks occur at the obliquity (41-kyr) and precessional (23-19-kyr) bands (Fig.  2g ). Though overall spectral power at the common orbital cyclicities is similar in both the Site U1542 SST record and the Antarctic EPICA Dome C ice core (EDC) temperature record, a direct comparison of the records reveals substantial differences. For example, the U1542 SST record shows prolonged warming trends throughout MIS 6 (~2 °C between early glaciation to termination), MIS 10 (~2 °C), and MIS 12 (~1 °C), which are not documented in the EDC record. Comparable trends are likewise evident in the core PS75/034-2 SST record 34  and in several other subantarctic SST records 16 , 44 , 45  (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). However, the U1542 SST variations show overall warmer temperatures (~2–3 °C) and higher amplitude glacial-interglacial changes (2–5 °C compared to 4–6 °C) than recorded at site PS75/034 (located outside the CHC ~ 200 nautical miles offshore U1542) (Fig.  2c, d ; Supplementary Fig.  6 ) 34 . These patterns reflect the warmer SSTs in the CHC and its larger variability in the past. Also occurring at site GeoB3327 (~43°S) in the Eastern South Pacific 34 , the common warming trend observed during several glacial stages in the subantarctic Southern Ocean is closely aligned with the 100-kyr amplitude modulation of precessional variations at low latitudes, implying that these trends are a direct response to low-latitude insolation forcing by eccentricity 34 , 46  (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Changes in reconstructed CHC strength and SST at Site U1542 covary on G/IG timescales during the last 790 kyr (Fig.  2b, c ). Increased CHC strength parallels warm SST during interglacial periods, while reduced flow speeds occur during glacial periods with colder SST. The overall direction of CHC strength changes across G/IG is similar to the reconstructed ACC variations in the central DP (core PS97/085-3 22 ), at the Pacific entrance of the DP (core PS97/093-2 37 ), and in the Central South Pacific (IODP Sites U1540/U1541 43 ). These similarities show that large-scale ACC changes accompany the G/IG variations of the CHC suggesting common forcings. Overall, interglacial maxima in our records stand-out more prominently and initiate more abruptly from the overall glacial background compared to deep-ocean sites. These patterns are most likely related to thresholds in the CHC response to G/IG climate changes, involving e.g., sea-level and the extent of the PIS. Site U1542 is presently located in the central CHC. Recent remote sensing-based oceanographic studies define the CHC as poleward flowing from ~50°S towards Cape Horn, where it merges with the Pacific ACC 28 , 29 , 31 . While the comparatively weak northern part of the CHC is mainly driven by pressure gradients through sea-level changes from oceanic waves propagating from the low latitudes, the stronger southern CHC is intimately linked to deep-ocean processes including ACC eddy activity 31 . It has been suggested that sediment records (i.e., sortable silt) generally correspond to the total water transport including wind-driven, barotropic, and eddy-induced transport 41 , 43 . However, based on the proxy data, it is impossible to distinguish the modern oceanographic processes in more detail on longer geological time scales. The above-average CHC strength during various interglacials indicates enhanced influence of the overall stronger Pacific ACC 43  on Site U1542. Additionally, low latitude forcings (e.g., Coastally-Trapped Waves propagated from the equator 31 ), might have been enhanced during strong interglacials. However, their influence on the bottom water current strength would be minor as the modern northern CHC is much weaker than the more ACC-influenced, stronger southern section. Conversely, we interpret the weaker glacial CHC as indicative of a generally weaker ACC system in the Pacific sector 43  and, at the same time less impact of low-latitude forcings. Today the CHC reveals pronounced seasonal changes 29 . During austral fall/winter, the southward meridional transport as characteristic for the CHC, extends several degrees latitude further north and retreats southward during austral spring/summer. These large seasonal changes are connected to the seasonal migration of the South Pacific Gyre and are today related to the Southern Annular Mode 47  and thus the SWW. On paleoceanographic time-scales, these seasonal changes imply that a northward extension of subantarctic ACC waters probably connected to a stronger SPC, which would be consistent with a northward migration of the Chilean bifurcation during cold periods. Conversely, relatively warm periods would be characterized by a poleward shift of the ACC, SPC and westerly wind circulation. These analogs would serve both for orbital-scale (G/IG) as well as shorter millennial-scale variations discussed in this paper. Glacial trends, however, diverge during MIS 2 and 8, showing long-term cooling coinciding with CHC current strengthening. This strengthening might relate to regional changes within the CHC, as the glacial trends were neither observed in the DP 22 , 37  nor in the central South Pacific 43  (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). At present, the core of the CHC is located close to the shelf break 27 , but could have been shifted slightly offshore due to the PIS reaching the continental slope during the last glacial period 39 . Moreover, a lower sea level likely also deflected the CHC further offshore, thus enhancing its strength at Site U1542 but not at the deep ACC sites. Notably, these long-term changes do not influence millennial-scale, but only orbital-scale variability and trends. The relationship between the reconstructed SST and CHC strength extends also to shorter timescales, for example for several major AIM (1, 4, 8, and 12) during the last glacial period, suggesting a connection between both orbital and millennial timescales (Fig.  3e, f ). Our CHC strength record mirrors the current record from sediment core PS97/085-3 22  for the last glacial (Fig.  3d ). This suggests that the CHC strength closely resembles (Fig.  3d, e ), the northern subantarctic ACC entering the DP on millennial-scales. In the DP, geostrophic current velocities are highest in the vicinity of the Subantarctic and Polar Front 48 , and latitudinal shifts of the fronts are linked to temperature changes 19 . This supports the idea that a reduction in the strength of the overall DP throughflow is linked to the northward shift of the Southern Ocean frontal system during glacial times 4 , 22 , 37 . Furthermore, Wu et al. 22  found a correspondence between millennial-scale maxima in the DP throughflow strength and major winter sea-ice retreat in the Scotia Sea. This potential link is consistent with our records, as both SST and CHC strength show similar orbital-scale variability as the sea-salt sodium (ssNa) record from the EDC ice core (Supplementary Fig.  7 ), a proxy for sea-ice extent and atmospheric circulation changes 49 . The sea-ice retreat is coupled to a strengthening and southward shift of the SWW, acting as a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies millennial-scale strengthening of the CHC flow speed 20 , 22 .

High millennial-scale variability is also recorded in in two SST records from the Chilean margin further north, core MR16-09PC03 (~45°S) and ODP Site 1233 (~41°S) (Fig.  3 ) 32 , 40 . Like our Site U1542 SST record, suborbital SST changes range from ~2 to 3 °C during the last glacial period, showing consistent timing and amplitude. Located north of Site U1542, ODP Site 1233 and core MR16-09PC03 suggest a stronger northward deflection of the SPC and ACC into the Humboldt Current system (i.e., the South Pacific Gyre) during cold periods, resulting in substantial millennial-scale variability. Taken together, these results support large-scale changes in the northward extent of the ACC and SPC, involving atmospheric variations of the SWW as important drivers for millennial-scale variations at Site U1542 4 . 790,000 years of Southern Hemisphere millennial-scale variability We used a threshold detection approach to distinguish the occurrence of climatic events on the SST and CHC strength records at Site U1542 (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). A SH event is defined in our record by an abrupt CHC strengthening (108 events identified in total) or SST warming (103 events) (see method, Supplementary Fig.  8 ). We classified each event by defining two categories based on the distribution of their amplitudes (Supplementary Fig.  8g, h, i ). We identified 66 major SST events characterized by a warming exceeding 1.6 °C and 51 major CHC strengthening events displaying a strengthening greater than 3.6 cm/s (corresponding to 24% of interglacial value, see Method, Supplementary Fig.  8 ). Not all strengthening events in the CHC are necessarily associated with an SST warming event, as SST events tend to occur only with the stronger CHC events. This partly different behavior of the bottom currents and SST within the CHC might be due to varying millennial-scale sensitivities and thresholds for SST and CHC strength changes. While both the SST and the current strength within the CHC are related to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation changes (as discussed for the G/IG variations), their individual response to ACC changes and low latitude forcings might vary. For example, SST changes might be more strongly linked to the advection of lower latitude water masses 28 , whereas the bottom water strength changes at our site are more strongly influenced by the ACC. Although the amplitude of associated warming and strengthening events appear to be independent of each other (Supplementary Fig.  9 ), the identification of a millennial-scale event in both SST and CHC strength records, particularly for major events, serves as a robust indicator of climate dynamics that can be related to both oceanic and atmospheric circulation. For instance, during the last glacial period, we observe a major increase of flow strength (increasing from 50% to 80% of the interglacial mean) co-occurring with a temperature rise of ~2 to 3 °C toward several major AIM events (i.e., AIM 4, 8, 12, and 17). We found 57 (46 related to millennial-scale events) events monitoring a CHC acceleration concomitant with SST warming within a timeframe shorter than 2 kyr. Millennial-scale SST and CHC strength events at Site U1542 often occur in the absolute SST range from ~4 to 6 °C and 35 to 55 % of interglacial CHC strength (Supplementary Fig.  9b, c ), corresponding to intermediate glacial periods (Fig.  2 ) 17 . This suggests that the CHC exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to climate during an intermediate climate state (i.e., transitional periods leading to full glacial conditions) or that events are larger during these periods, consistent with findings from NH records 5 , 11 , 13 , 15 . Several studies have suggested that a prolonged intermediate climate state, such as MIS 3, provides favorable conditions for high amplitude DO-type variability 13 , 50 . During full glacial boundary conditions (e.g., LGM), NH records suggest a relatively stable climate with reduced millennial-scale variability 5 . For both SST and CHC strength records, the frequency of millennial-scale events recorded at Site U1542 seems to follow a stochastic pattern, lacking any discernible cyclic behavior (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). The recurrence of the millennial-scale warming events slightly increases after the Mid-Brunhes Transition (MBT) 51  (Supplementary Fig.  9d, e ), likely due to an increase of glacial period duration. This implies that the magnitude of millennial-scale events, particularly SST events, changes with background climate and that the MBT affects climate variability from orbital to millennial timescales. In contrast, the amplitude of millennial-scale events is smaller during warmer periods, consistent with the relative stability observed during extended interglacial periods in the Northern Hemisphere 5 , 13 , 15 . A persistent interhemispheric teleconnection Over the last glacial period, SST records from the eastern South Pacific (ESP) region have been shown to reveal an “Antarctic timing” of millennial-scale temperature patterns 33 , 52 , 53 , i.e., the SST pattern follows the Antarctic temperature reconstruction known from Antarctic ice cores. Millennial-scale climate events at Site U1542 are found to be contemporaneous with several AIM events 7  (Fig.  3 ). Additionally, our SST and CHC strength records is consistent in timing and amplitude with a Southwest Pacific Mg/Ca SST record resolving millennial-scale changes and spanning the past three glacial cycles (Fig.  5f ; Supplementary Fig.  12 ) 16 . This suggests that the SST changes in both records represent surface changes of the wider subantarctic Southern Ocean. In addition, the timing of our millennial-scale climate events coincides with that recorded in DP sediment core PS97/085-3 22  over the last glacial period (Fig.  3d ). This record further reveals that the ACC accelerated during Antarctic warming events, in parallel with the weakening of the AMOC during Heinrich Stadials 9  in the NH, as indicated by high  231 Pa/ 230 Th ratios 54  (Fig.  3c ). According to the bipolar seesaw concept 8 , NH stadial events are expected to be associated with SST warming in the SH, and ACC strengthening events as observed during the last glacial period 22  (Fig.  3b ). These comparisons over the more recent G/IG cycles suggests that our U1542 records are consistent with the interhemispheric timing predicted by the bipolar seesaw. To robustly assess interhemispheric connections across the past 790 kyr, we identified cooling events at Site U1385 (located at the Iberian margin in the North Atlantic) 13 , a high-resolution record spanning the last million years. The planktic δ 18 O signal from Site U1385 primarily reflects surface temperature conditions and is an indicator of NH millennial-scale surface water changes. By applying the same thresholding approach used for Site U1542, we identified 110 NH cooling stadial events (69 major events) at Site U1385 over the past 800 kyr, consistent with the findings of Hodell et al. 13 . We subsequently compared amplitude and number of events per glacial cycle between the records to mitigate age model uncertainties. The interhemispheric comparison reveals similarities between both records in the amplitude and number of events per glacial cycle (Fig.  4 ). For instance, the average amplitude of events recorded during MIS 8 and MIS 9 (243–337 ka,) shows the highest values, gradually decreasing during the last two glacial cycles. These similarities are less evident for the older glacial cycles. For instance, during MIS 12 and 13, the average CHC strength amplitude is higher than in the NH record. likely because of the prominent CHC event at 490 kyr. The number of events per 10 kyr period for each glacial cycle (Fig.  4b ) is also similar for both records. This includes the number of cooling events in the NH being strongly correlated with the number of CHC strengthening events for the last 621 kyr, while it shows a moderate correlation with the number of SST warming events. The interhemispheric disparity in several cycles likely arises from the enhanced local sensitivity, notably influenced by the presence of the PIS that reached the continental shelf edge at glacial maxima 39 . During the LGM, records from the Chilean margin and DP depict higher amplitude millennial-scale events (Fig.  3d–h ) compared to NH records (Fig.  3a–c ). In both sediment records from Site U1542 and U1385, we observe an intensification of amplitudes and recurrence times of millennial-scale events after the MBT (Fig.  4 ). This suggests that the MBT, induced by changes in insolation 55 , not only amplified the G/IG signal 51  but also influenced the climate on the millennial timescale. Fig. 4 The amplitude and number of millennial-scale events for each glacial cycle. Comparing all events within a single glacial cycle reduces the impact of age model uncertainties between the two locations, as glacial terminations are marked abrupt and distinct patterns, making them more reliable indicators (original data are shown in background).  a  Average amplitude of stadial events at Site U1385 (orange), sea surface temperature (SST) warming events (purple), and Cape Horn Current (CHC) strengthening events (blue) at Site U1542 for each glacial cycle, highlighting a correlation between the amplitude in one hemisphere and that in the other. A high variability observed in one hemisphere during a glacial period often corresponds to high variability in the other hemisphere.  b  Number of events per 10 kyr for each glacial period. For example, during the penultimate glacial cycle (130–243 ka), there was an average of 1.5 CHC events, 1.5 SST warming events, and 1.5 cooling events in the northern hemisphere per 10 kyr. An interhemispheric correlation between the average amplitude ( c ,  d ) and the number ( e ,  f ) of events for each glacial cycles shows that glacial cycles with higher event frequencies or amplitude in one hemisphere tend to have similarly high frequencies or amplitude in the other hemisphere, as shown in ( c – f ). Number on the figures  c – f  refers to the red number in ( a ) and ( b ) indicating the glacial cycle. At Site U1385, a notable out-of-phase relationship between benthic and planktic oxygen isotopes has been documented, representing a southern signal in deep waters versus a northern signal in surface waters within a single record 56 . This out-of-phase pattern aligns with Antarctic and Greenland climate records, respectively, and illustrates the bipolar seesaw mechanism, extended over the mid-to-late Pleistocene 13 , 56 . We find millennial-scale features of SST and CHC strength at Site U1542 matching the North Atlantic benthic δ 18 O record, within age model uncertainties (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). For instance, during the penultimate glacial period, SST and CHC strength millennial-scale climate events at Site U1542 are in phase with benthic δ 18 O fluctuations observed in the Iberian margin sediment core (referred to as AIM6i to AIM6vi, between 180 and 155 ka, Supplementary Fig.  12a ) 56 , themselves synchronous with AIM events 56 . Expanding upon these observations, we find that several major surface warming and CHC strengthening episodes recorded at Site U1542 can be associated with negative benthic δ 13 C incursions in the North Atlantic at Site U1308 (Fig.  5b , Supplementary Fig.  12 ), and/or increased IRD concentrations at ODP 983 (Fig.  5a , Supplementary Fig.  12 ): both parameters associated with a reduced AMOC during these events 11 , 12 . This suggests that these important variations of DP throughflow that have been linked to AMOC instability over the last glacial cycle 22 , persisted over the past 800 kyr. Furthermore, this one-to-one relationship reinforces previous findings highlighting strong interhemispheric climate linkages on orbital and millennial time scales 25 , 57 .

In addition to these oceanic mechanisms for interhemispheric climate linkages related to the bipolar seesaw, atmospheric teleconnections have been proposed to operate, at least for the last glacial cycle. For example, strong millennial-scale SST warming during Heinrich event 1 at Site 1233 has been linked to southward displacements and/or strengthening of the SWW induced by a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone 58 . This atmospheric interhemispheric teleconnection would plausibly affect both SSTs and CHC strength, as the CHC is also connected to the migration of the South Pacific Gyre. Studies of anthropogenic climate change using both models and observations detect an acceleration of averaged zonal flow on the northern flank of the ACC and identify anthropogenic ocean warming as the dominant driver 59 . Moreover, considering the widely anticipated weakening of the AMOC in response to anthropogenic warming 60 , 61 , state-of-the-art climate models seem to reinforce the idea of the teleconnection between Southern Ocean conditions and circulation in the North Atlantic. Although occurring on a shorter time scale, this corroborates the fundamental physical relationship between SST, CHC/ACC strength, and ocean circulation that form the baseline of this study. Role of ACC in CO 2  exchanges The Southern Ocean modulates the exchange of CO 2  between the deep sea and the atmosphere 19 , 20 . The latitudinal shifts of the SWW exert control over the balance between the biological carbon pump, which sequesters carbon into the deep ocean through the sinking of biological carbon from the surface ocean 62 , 63  and the release of CO 2  from ventilation of deep water upwelling in response to surface ocean stratification 60 , 64 , 65 . The mechanistic relationship between surface ocean conditions and atmospheric CO 2  changes is closely tied to shifts in the SWW, a major driver of CO 2  upwelling 64 , as well as ACC strength 4 , 22 . To evaluate the role of ACC strength variability in driving atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) variability, we compare the rate of atmospheric CO 2  changes smoothed over a 2-kyr-period (Fig.  6 ) 11  with our current strength reconstruction that mirrors both orbital- (Fig.  2a, b ) and millennial-scale (Fig.  3d, e , Supplementary Fig.  5 ) changes in the northern, subantarctic CHC/ACC entering the DP. We found 57 atmospheric CO 2  release events, in the same order as major CHC strengthening events (51). Millennial-scale CHC strengthening events range from 24% to 50% (Fig.  6a ), while strengthening related to glacial terminations reaches 70%. Similarly, atmospheric CO 2  release events range from 5 ppmv to ~35 ppmv (Fig.  6b ), while atmospheric CO 2  release related to glacial terminations reaches 80 ppmv. Glacial terminations present higher CO 2  rise compared to millennial-scale events, likely because other processes than CHC/ACC changes affect CO 2  rise during glacial terminations. Although taking into account of age model uncertainties, we associated 31 (10 related to glacial terminations) atmospheric CO 2  release events with CHC strengthening events occurring within the moving 7-kyr windows (Fig.  6c , Supplementary Fig.  11 ), suggesting that the relative changes in flow strength appear to be positively correlated to the amplitude of CO 2  variations (Fig.  6c ).

Light red area indicates millennial-scale window. Ahn and Brook 66  and more recently Barker et al. 11  have observed a relative shoaling in the North Atlantic deep-water formation as well as an increase in IRD deposits in the North Atlantic during phases of rising CO 2  (Fig.  5a ). An AMOC disturbance induces a change in the meridional heat transport resulting in heat being retained in the Southern Hemisphere, which can then melt sea-ice 65  and/or cause a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone 67 . This can result in a strengthening and southward displacement of the SWW, enhancing ACC strength, decreasing Southern Ocean stratification, promoting ventilation, and consequently, increasing atmospheric CO 2  levels. The similarities between CO 2  changes and CHC strength confirm and extend the role of the ACC fluctuations in enhancing the exchange between surface and deeper water in the Southern Ocean and the corresponding release of CO 2 64 , 65 , 67 . During each glacial inception, a reduction in SWW wind-driven upwelling, marked by the abrupt drop in the CHC strength record (up to 70% reduction during Inception 6, 3, 2, and 1; Fig.  6a ) may have reduced the exchange of water from the deep ocean to the surface, thus contributing to the storage of carbon in the deep ocean and the reduction of atmospheric CO 2 62 . Other mechanisms, such as dust-borne iron fertilization 68 , and SST and salinity changes 69  also contributed to the continuing and more gradual drawdown of CO 2  (Supplementary Fig.  11c ) throughout the glacial stage by enhancing the efficiency of the global ocean’s physical and biological pump 62 , 70 . In conclusion, Site U1542, located underneath the palaeoceanographically sensitive CHC, provides unprecedented insights into the millennial-scale CHC variability over the past 790 kyr in the ESP. Coupled CHC strength and SST changes provide compelling evidence that millennial-scale variability previously documented for the last glacial cycle persisted for the last eight glacial cycles. In line with evidence from other Southern Ocean records, this variability is representative of the broader SH. A comparison with NH records indicates that the interhemispheric dynamics observed during the last glacial period have persisted over the Pleistocene. Periods of climate instability in one hemisphere align with those in the other hemisphere, imply that the expected impact of DP throughflow changes on the Atlantic circulation characteristic for the most recent glacial cycle extends to the past 800 kyr. The CHC strength record supports the significant role played by the ACC in promoting inter-basin water mass exchange in the Southern Ocean can influence atmospheric CO 2  levels. Notably, these findings align with contemporary observations of a warming and accelerated Southern Ocean 71  in conjunction with AMOC weakening 72  under anthropogenic forcing of the climate."

143,introduction,"Introduction The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is the Atlantic component of the global ocean conveyor belt, a large-scale ocean circulation system that carries heat, salt, carbon, and other biogeochemical elements along its paths 1 , 2 . Thus, the AMOC is a crucial component of the global heat, salt, nutrients and carbon balances affecting the associated regional climate, sea-level, and marine ecosystems 3 – 9 . For instance, the AMOC-related carbon sinking in the high-latitude North Atlantic accounts for a significant portion of the anthropogenic carbon inventory of the global ocean 10 – 12 ; thus, the amount of anthropogenic carbon sequestered by the ocean is closely tied to the strength of the AMOC 13 – 16 . The climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), when combined together, display a slow increase in the AMOC during the historical period until around the mid-1980s primarily due to increased anthropogenic aerosol loading, and a decline afterward due to increased CO 2  and reduced aerosol loading 17 – 19 . The decline in CMIP6 models from 1985 to 2014 amounts to about −2.3 Sv 17 . In reference to the observed mean value of 16.7 Sv at 26.5°N (between January 2005 and December 2021) 20 – 22 , it represents a 14% decrease per 30 years, which is within the range of the projected rate of weakening during 2015 − 2100 (i.e., 6 ~ 8 Sv or 13 ~ 17% per 30 years) 23 . Hence, the historical AMOC evolution during the past several decades may provide invaluable insights into the projected future weakening of the AMOC. The observed AMOC at 26.5°N was relatively strong in 2005 (19.2 Sv) but decreased rapidly in 2009 (14.6 Sv) and 2010 (14.9 Sv). After 2010, however, it gradually recovered 20 – 22  until it peaked in 2018 (18.0 Sv) and then weakened again until 2021 (15.3 Sv), showing virtually no trend during 2011-21 (−0.1 Sv per decade). Although an overall decreasing trend is found for the entire observational period (−1.1 Sv per decade during 2005-21), the linear trend is sensitive to the relatively strong AMOC values in the initial years. For instance, removing the first two years, the linear trend during 2007-21 becomes only −0.2 Sv per decade. Consistently, the time-mean AMOC at 26.5°N in the first 10 years (2005-14) is reduced by only −0.2 Sv in the latter 7 years (2015-21), thus displaying a strong resilience at the interdecadal time scale. A recent update of the submarine cable measurement record of the Florida Current transport, a critical component of the AMOC, further reduces the weakening trend of the annual mean AMOC during 2005-21 by about 40% (i.e., from −1.1 Sv per decade to −0.6 Sv per decade) 24 . Although there is no long-term continuous observational record of the AMOC prior to April 2004, several studies based on a hydrographic data-constrained model, a high-resolution ocean reanalysis, and multiple ocean models forced by reanalysis surface flux fields suggested an interdecadal swing of the historical AMOC similar to that in CMIP6 models 25 – 30 . However, those studies concluded that the historical AMOC swing was predominantly modulated by natural interdecadal climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), although several proxy-based studies suggested a longer-term, thus presumably anthropogenic, weakening of the AMOC since the mid- or late-19th century 31 – 34 . As such, currently there is no strong consensus regarding the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic drivers in the past AMOC changes 35 . For that reason, it is quite uncertain when the projected weakening of the AMOC will emerge, or if it has already emerged, and can be detected. Here, we use a suite of climate and ocean model simulations along with direct observational data to attribute the interdecadal variation of the historical AMOC since the mid-1950s to the externally forced signal (i.e., largely anthropogenic forcings but also includes solar and volcanic forcings) and natural signal. Specifically, the RAPID/Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array/Western Boundary Time Series (RAPID) moored array 22  and 10 surface-forced ocean model simulations participating in the Ocean Model Intercomparison Project Phase-2 (OMIP2 27 , Supplementary Table  1 ) are analyzed to derive the historical AMOC; two sets of large ensemble climate model simulations, based on the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) 36 , and the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (SPEAR) 37 , and 20 CMIP6 model simulations (Supplementary Tables  2  and  3 ) are analyzed to derive the externally forced signal; and the difference between the historical and externally forced AMOC components is analyzed to estimate the natural signal (Methods). After separating the natural signal from the externally forced one, we further examine if the time evolution of the natural AMOC is a physically consistent response to its main driver - interdecadal NAO variability 38 – 45 . Finally, we discuss the potential decadal predictability of the natural AMOC component at 26.5°N and the expected range of the AMOC at 26.5°N during the next several years."
144,results,"Results Interdecadal variations of the AMOC components at 26.5°N Figure  1a  shows the decadally averaged time series of the AMOC anomalies at 26.5°N from the decade centered in 1960 (i.e., 1955-64) to the decade centered in 2050 (i.e., 2045-54), derived from CESM2 (green), OMIP2 (blue) and RAPID (magenta). To allow a better visual comparison of the three interdecadal AMOC time series, the time-averaged RAPID AMOC transport value of 16.7 Sv is removed from each time series (Methods). The AMOC values derived from OMIP2 and RAPID are referred to as the total component, and those from the ensemble mean of CESM2 as the externally forced component. The differences between the two (i.e., total - externally forced) are referred to as the residual component (orange bars in Fig.  1a ), which would represent natural variability provided OMIP2 and CESM2 yield realistic levels of the total and externally forced AMOC components, respectively. It should be noted that the relative strengths of the three AMOC components are sensitive to the AMOC adjustments (i.e., bias corrections) in OMIP2 and CESM2 (Methods); thus, our analysis is for the most part based on the rate of interdecadal change in the AMOC (Fig.  1b ) since it is not affected by the adjustments in OMIP2 and CESM2. Hereafter, the decade centered in a particular year is simply denoted as the centered year (e.g., the period of 1985–94 is denoted as 1990). Fig. 1 Interdecadal time series of the AMOC and its rate of change at 26.5°N. a  Decade-averaged time series of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) anomalies at 26.5°N ( ψ max  -  ψ o ) from the decade centered in 1960 to the decade centered in 2050, derived from OMIP2 (blue), CESM2 (green) and RAPID (magenta). The time-averaged RAPID AMOC transport value of 16.7 Sv ( ψ o ) (Methods) is removed from each time series. The AMOC values derived from OMIP2 and RAPID are referred to as the total component, those from the ensemble mean of CESM2 the externally forced component, and the differences between them (i.e., total - externally forced) the residual component (orange). The error bars in ( a ) indicate the 95% limits of the adjusted CESM2 ensemble spread (“Methods”), meaning that about 95% of the adjusted 80 ensembles reside within the error bars.  b  Same as ( a ) except that the rate of interdecadal AMOC change is shown. Red dashed lines in ( a ) and ( b ) indicate the period during which the total AMOC values are derived from RAPID only. The units are  Sv  (10 6 
 m 3 sec −1 ) for the AMOC, and  Sv  per decade for the rate of AMOC changes. As shown in Fig.  1a , the total and externally forced AMOC components show a similar interdecadal swing with an increase from 1960 to 1990 and a decrease from 2000 to 2020. This suggests that the interdecadal variation in the AMOC from 1960 to 2020 represents a response to the external forcing. However, the total AMOC peaks in 2000, whereas the externally forced AMOC component peaks in 1980-90. Additionally, the internal variability in the CESM2 ensembles (i.e., error bars in Fig.  1a , Methods) is much larger than the externally forced signals; thus, the interdecadal AMOC swing from 1960 to 2020 could also be of natural origin 46 – 48 . Indeed, the total increase from 1960 to 1990 is much greater than the externally forced increase during that period, whereas the total decrease from 2000 to 2020 is much weaker than the externally forced decrease during that period (Fig.  1a, b ). Thus, the residual component is strongly negative prior to 1990 and positive afterward (Fig.  1a ). More specifically, the residual component contributes +1.1 Sv to the total increase between 1960 and 1990. Thus, the total increase in the AMOC from 1960 to 1990 ( + 2.2 Sv) can be partitioned into a + 1.1 Sv increase (50%) in the externally forced component and a + 1.1 Sv increase (50%) in the residual component (Fig.  1b ). It appears that the external forcing plays a major role in increasing the AMOC from 1960 to 1980 (Fig.  1b ). However, a steep increase in the residual component from 1980 to 1990 ( + 1.6 Sv) is almost completely responsible for the AMOC increase during that period (Fig.  1b ). After reaching its peak in 1980–90, the externally forced component starts decreasing. From 1990 to 2000, it decreases by −0.6 Sv. However, the total AMOC continues to increase moderately by +0.4 Sv due to a large increase in the residual component ( + 1.0 Sv). Thus, the external forcing is not the primary driver of the AMOC increase from 1980 to 2000 in agreement with previous studies 49 , 50 . As indicated in Fig.  1 a and  b , the decrease in the externally forced AMOC component from 2000 to 2020 (i.e., due to increased CO 2  and reduced aerosol loading) is −2.6 Sv. This is mitigated by a + 1.0 Sv increase in the residual component, yielding a −1.6 Sv decrease in the total. Although this is somewhat small (i.e., a 10% of the total), it is important to note that the external forcing is the sole driver of the AMOC slowdown from 2000 to 2020. This result is in disagreement with the conventional argument that the reduction of the AMOC after its peak in 2000 is largely due to the concurrent weakening of the NAO 25 – 30 . In contrast to that argument, the residual component remains positive and continues to increase overall after 1990, despite a small decrease from 2000 to 2010, and thus largely mitigates the externally forced weakening of the AMOC after 1990 (Fig.  1a, b ). The mitigating effect of the residual component becomes quite strong during the recent period from 2010 to 2020 ( + 1.1 Sv); thus, the externally forced weakening of the AMOC (−1.3 Sv) is nearly compensated for during that period (Fig.  1b ). The interdecadal variation of the externally forced AMOC component derived from CESM2 is largely consistent with that derived from CMIP6 and SPEAR (Fig.  2 ). However, several differences are noteworthy. For instance, the rate of weakening in the externally forced component (after 1990) is generally smaller in CMIP6 compared to that of CESM2 and SPEAR although the inter-model spread is very large among the 20 CMIP6 models used in this study (i.e., error bars in Fig.  2a , Methods). In particular, the rate of interdecadal weakening in the externally forced component from 2000 to 2010 is smallest in CMIP6 (−0.8 Sv), slightly larger in SPEAR (−0.9 Sv) and largest in CESM2 (−1.3 Sv). Accordingly, the residual AMOC component decreases from 2000 to 2010 by −0.6 Sv if CMIP6 is used to represent the externally forced component, −0.5 Sv if SPEAR is used, and only −0.1 Sv if CESM2 is used. Thus, the residual component plays an active role in the weakening of the AMOC from 2000 to 2010 (−1.4 Sv) if either CMIP6 or SPEAR is used to represent the externally forced component. See Supplementary Notes  1 – 2  and Supplementary Figs.  1 – 5  for more discussion on the sensitivity in attributing interdecadal AMOC variations to model resolution in OMIP2 and CMIP6 models. Fig. 2 Interdecadal time series of the AMOC and its rate of change at 26.5°N based on CMIP6 and SPEAR. a ,  b  Same as Fig.  1a, b  but the externally forced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) component is derived from CMIP6.  c ,  d  Same as Fig.  1a, b  but the externally forced AMOC component is derived from SPEAR. The error bars in ( a ) indicate the 95% limits of the CMIP6 multi-model spread (Methods), meaning that about 95% of the 20 CMIP6 models reside within the error bars. Similarly, the error bars in ( c ) indicate the 95% limits of the SPEAR ensemble spread (Methods), meaning that about 95% of the adjusted 30 SPEAR ensembles reside within the error bars. In summary, our analysis suggests that the increase in the AMOC at 26.5°N from 1980 to 2000 is mainly driven by an increase in the residual component while the external forcing suppresses the increase in the AMOC from 1990 to 2000. In contrast, the slowdown of the AMOC at 26.5°N from 2000 to 2010 is primarily driven by the external forcing and possibly augmented by the residual component. From 2010 to 2020, however, a large increase in the residual component nearly compensates for the externally forced weakening of the AMOC. In the next section, we examine if the interdecadal variation of the residual AMOC component can be ratified as a physically consistent response to its main driver - interdecadal NAO variability 38 – 45 . Interdecadal variation of the residual AMOC component The residual component represents not only natural variability of the AMOC, but also deficiencies in the climate and surface-forced ocean models used involving, for instance, the lack of land-ice melting, and the insufficient model resolution for boundary currents, deep water formation, and mesoscale eddies 51 . Therefore, in this section, we investigate if the residual component reasonably represents natural variability despite potential contaminations arising from deficiencies in the climate and surface-forced ocean models used. If we assume that the residual component reflects natural variability to a reasonable degree, Fig.  1 a and b suggest that natural variability keeps the AMOC in a relatively weakened state from 1960 to 1980 and then produces a steep increase from 1980 to 1990 in tandem with the external forcing during 1960-80. Then, it works against the external forcing to mitigate the slowdown of the AMOC from 1990 to 2020. As such, the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N increases greatly from 1980 to 2020 ( + 3.6 Sv). Figure  1b  further shows that the increase occurs mainly during three interdecadal periods from 1980 to 1990 ( + 1.6 Sv), from 1990 to 2000 ( + 1.0 Sv), and from 2010 to 2020 ( + 1.1 Sv). As shown in Fig.  2 , if either CMIP6 or SPEAR is used to represent the externally forced component, the corresponding transports of the residual AMOC component show similar interdecadal variations. Given the well-known physical relationship between the NAO-induced surface buoyancy flux, deep convection in the subpolar North Atlantic, and the AMOC 38 – 45 , we examine if the interdecadal increases in the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N during the 1980s, 1990s and 2010s (Figs.  1 b,  2 b and d) can be explained as a physically consistent response to interdecadal NAO variability. As indicated in Fig.  3a , a strong negative December-May NAO prevailed from 1960 to 1970. After a pause (i.e., a neutral NAO) in 1980, it switched to a strong positive NAO in 1990, and then weakened to a neutral NAO in 2000 and 2010. This was followed by the development of another strong positive NAO in 2020 (Methods, Supplementary Note  3 , and Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Fig. 3 Relationship between the NAO and residual AMOC component. a  Decade-averaged time series of the December-May North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, gray), the time-integrated NAO (red), and the residual Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) component at 26.5°N (orange). The NAO time series is derived from ERA5. The time integrated NAO is computed by accumulating the time series of the December-May NAO from 1970.  b – g  The responses of the residual AMOC component to (case-1) a negative NAO for the first 10 years ( b ) followed by a neutral NAO for the latter 10 years ( c ), to (case-2) a neutral NAO for the first 10 years ( d ) followed by a positive NAO for the latter 10 years ( e ), and to (case-3) a positive NAO for the first 10 years ( f ) followed by a neutral NAO for the latter 10 years ( g ). The gray dashed lines in ( b – g ) indicate the latitude of 26.5°N. The composite analysis is carried out based on CESM2. The NAO and time-integrated NAO indices are normalized by the corresponding standard deviation, and thus are unitless. The units for the residual AMOC component are  Sv  (10 6 
 m 3 sec −1 ). The development of a strong positive NAO in 1990 from a neutral NAO in 1980 aligns well with the large increase in the residual AMOC component from 1980 to 1990. Similarly, the development of another strong positive NAO in 2020 from a neutral NAO in 2010 (i.e., 2005-14) matches well with the large increase in the residual AMOC component from 2010 to 2020. However, no such direct relationship between the NAO and residual AMOC component is found in other interdecadal periods. For instance, the strong negative NAO in 1960 and 1970 turned into a neutral NAO in 1980, but the residual AMOC component remains strongly negative in 1980. Additionally, the strong positive NAO in 1990 turned into a neutral NAO phase in 2000. However, the residual AMOC component persists and even increases from 1990 to 2000. Thus, it appears that when a strong NAO develops and continues for a decade, it provides sufficient momentum and duration for the AMOC to spin up during that decade. Furthermore, if the strong NAO recedes into a neutral NAO in the next decade, the NAO-driven residual AMOC component tends to persist and even intensify throughout the neutral phase that follows. These results are by and large consistent with the NAO leading the AMOC at 26.5°N by 3 − 15 years in the majority of climate and surface-forced ocean models 41 , 43 , 44 . Thus, at interdecadal time scales, the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N may be roughly regarded as a time-integrated response to the NAO (see Fig.  3a ) as proposed in previous studies 52 – 55 . More specifically, the NAO-driven surface buoyancy flux is integrated into ocean density changes in the subpolar North Atlantic producing a meridional ocean density gradient anomaly between the subpolar and subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. The NAO-driven surface buoyancy flux continues to drive the anomalous density gradient until the NAO turns into a neutral phase. Thus, the anomalous ocean density gradient increases until a strong NAO turns into a neutral phase, and then remains at that amplitude while the neutral NAO condition continues. The anomalous meridional density gradient in turn should drive the residual AMOC component via dynamic ocean adjustment processes with a time delay. Thus, the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N can be described as a delayed ocean dynamic adjustment to the time-integrated NAO (hereafter, a time-integrated & delayed response to the NAO). However, if the neutral NAO continues for an extended period, the anomalous density gradient should be eventually dissipated by the anomalous meridional heat and salt transports by the residual AMOC component; thus, the residual AMOC component should also be dissipated, but it may take much longer than a decade for that to happen. To validate the above rationale, we use the December-May NAO and the residual AMOC component derived from the 80-member CESM2 ensembles to carry out a composite analysis. First, the NAO index time series is computed and averaged for each decade from 1850 to 2020 for the entire 80 ensembles to derive a total of 1360 decadal NAO index samples (Methods). These samples are then sorted to identify positive NAO (upper-terciles), neutral NAO (mid-terciles) and negative NAO cases (lower-terciles). The first composite is under a negative NAO during the first decade followed by a neutral NAO during the subsequent decade (case-1). The second composite is under a neutral NAO during the first decade followed by a positive NAO in the subsequent decade (case-2). The third composite is under a positive NAO phase during the first decade followed by a neutral NAO during the subsequent decade (case-3). As shown in Fig.  3b–g , if a negative NAO develops and persists for a decade, the residual AMOC component decreases during that decade (case-1). Similarly, if a positive NAO develops and continues for a decade, the residual AMOC component increases during that decade (case-3). If the negative or positive NAO recedes into a neutral NAO during the subsequent decade, the NAO-driven residual AMOC component largely persists in the subtropical North Atlantic throughout the neutral phase that follows, and even intensifies in some latitudes (cases-1 and −3). Lastly, if a neutral NAO persists for a decade followed by a positive NAO for the subsequent decade, the residual AMOC component increases during the latter decade (case-2). Thus, the composite analysis supports the relationship between the NAO and the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N shown in Fig.  3a  and thus the rationale that at interdecadal time scale the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N can be regarded as a time-integrated & delayed response to the NAO. It is worthwhile to note that the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N decreases from 2000 to 2010 (Figs.  1 b,  2 b &  2d ) although the extent of the decrease depends on the climate model used to represent the externally forced component. This decrease appears to be a dissipation of the elevated residual AMOC component in response to the prolonged near-neutral NAO condition during 2000 and 2010 (Fig.  3a ). An important point to note from the case-1 and case-3 is that while the residual AMOC component remains strong in the subtropical region during the neutral NAO period in the latter decade, it tends to dissipate in the subpolar region during that period. This result is in agreement with previous modeling studies 40 , 43 , and suggests that the residual AMOC component in the subpolar region responds much more quickly and directly to the NAO-driven deep convection anomalies compared to the residual AMOC component in the subtropical region. See Supplementary Fig.  7  for the responses of the residual AMOC component to the nine different possible cases of interdecadal NAO variability. To summarize, we show in Fig.  4  the sea level pressure anomalies in December-May for each decade from 1960 to 2020 derived from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis-5 (ERA5) 56  and the implied interdecadal changes (i.e., the difference between the first and subsequent decades) in the residual AMOC component derived from the composite analysis. The development of a strong positive NAO in 1990 from a neutral NAO in 1980 increases the residual AMOC component from 1980 to 1990, and the development of another strong positive NAO in 2020 from a neutral NAO in 2010 (i.e., 2005-14) increases the residual AMOC component from 2010 to 2020, consistent with case-2. The strong negative NAO in 1960 and 1970 turned into a neutral NAO in 1980, but the residual AMOC component remains negative and slightly decreases further in 1980 in the subtropical North Atlantic, consistent with case-1. Lastly, the strong positive NAO in 1990 turned into a neutral NAO in 2000, but the residual AMOC component remains positive and increases in the subtropical North Atlantic between 1990 and 2000, consistent with case-3. Fig. 4 Interdecadal sea level pressure anomalies and the implied rates of change in the residual AMOC component. a ,  b ,  d – g  Sea level pressure anomalies in December-May for each decade from 1955-64 to 2015-22 derived from ERA5 and  c ,  h – j  the implied rates of interdecadal change (i.e., the difference between the first 10 years and the latter 10 years) in the residual Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) component (shades) derived from the composite analysis. The contours in ( c, h–j ) indicate the time averaged total AMOC derived from CESM2. The gray dashed lines in ( c ,  h – j ) indicate the latitude of 26.5°N. The units are  hPa  for sea level pressure anomalies, and  Sv  (10 6 
 m 3 sec −1 ) per decade for the rate of interdecadal change in the residual AMOC component. Potential decadal predictability of the residual AMOC component The externally forced AMOC weakening is projected to continue in the next decade and beyond throughout the rest of the 21st century 23 . Between 2020 and 2030, for instance, the AMOC at 26.5°N is expected to weaken by −0.8 Sv according to CESM2 (Fig.  1 a,  b ). Therefore, in reference to the observed value of the AMOC during 2015-21 (i.e., 16.6 Sv), the expected mean value of the AMOC at 26.5°N in 2030 is 15.8 Sv assuming that the residual AMOC component in 2020 remains the same in the next decade. A similar value of 15.9 Sv is projected from both CMIP6 and SPEAR. However, based on the composite analysis and previous studies 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 , the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N may stay elevated or even further increase during the next decade as a time-integrated & delayed response to the strong positive NAO in 2020. Thus, we explore in this section the potential decadal predictability of the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N. We first explore the lead-lag correlations between the December-May NAO index and the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N derived from all 80-member CESM2 ensembles. As shown in Fig.  5a , the correlations tend to be maximized when the NAO leads the residual AMOC component by 0 ~ 15 years. For some ensemble members, the maximum correlations are quite high exceeding the 95% confidence level. However, when all 80 ensemble members are merged together (green line), the maximum correlation drops below the 95% confidence level, in agreement with an earlier study based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models 44 . Therefore, despite the positive correlation between the NAO and residual AMOC component, the time history of NAO is not a reliable predictor of the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N in CESM2 (see Supplementary Fig.  8 ). A consistent result is found when either 22 CMIP6 models under the preindustrial scenario (Supplementary Table  3 ) or 30 ensemble members of SPEAR are used to compute the lead-lag correlations between the December-May NAO index and the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N (Fig.  5b,c ). This result is surprising given the critical role of the NAO in the interdecadal AMOC variation in OMIP2 44 . A previous study pointed out that the NAO simulated in fully coupled models tends to display weaker-than-observed interdecadal variations, and thus its influence on interdecadal AMOC variations may be underestimated 42 . Fig. 5 Lead-lag correlations of the NAO and the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N and autocorrelations of the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N. a – c  Lead-lag correlations between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the residual Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) component at 26.5°N, and ( d – f ) the autocorrelations of the residual AMOC component derived from ( a ,  d ) CESM2, ( b ,  e ) CMIP6 and ( c ,  f ) SPEAR. The green lines in ( a – f ) indicate the ensemble-averaged correlation values. The orange lines in ( a – f ) indicate the ensemble spread (i.e., standard deviation). Thick horizontal lines in ( a – f ) indicate the 95% confidence intervals (based on a Student- t  test) and zero correlations. The degree of freedom for the Student- t  test is determined by the number of decades since the NAO and AMOC indices are smoothed by performing a 10-year running-average prior to the correlation analysis to focus on interdecadal time scale.  g – i  The residual AMOC component values at 26.5°N averaged for each decade are plotted against the residual AMOC component values for the corresponding next 1-5 years, derived from ( g ) CESM2, ( h ) CMIP6 and ( i ) SPEAR. The green lines in ( g – i ) indicate the mean slopes of the residual AMOC component between a past decade and the next 1–5 years. The pair of orange lines in ( g – i ) indicate the 95% limits of the regressed residual AMOC component values. The red vertical lines in ( g – i ) indicate the residual AMOC component values at 26.5°N averaged for the period of 2015-21. The numerical values at the four corners of ( g – i ) indicate the number of dots within each of the four quadrants. The units for the residual AMOC component are  Sv  (10 6 
 m 3 sec −1 ). We next explore if the history of the residual AMOC component serves as a potential predictor for the future evolution of the residual AMOC component. Figure  5d  shows the autocorrelations of the residual AMOC component derived from the CESM2 ensembles. When all 80 ensemble members are merged together (green line), the autocorrelation, which has the zero-crossing at the time lead-lag of around 30-year, is statistically significant above the 95% confidence level at the time lead-lag of 13-year and shorter. Additionally, for the majority of the ensemble members (i.e., 71 out of 80), the autocorrelation values are above the 95% confidence level at the time lead-lag of 10-year, suggesting that the history of the residual AMOC component is a potential source for predicting the future residual AMOC component. This result is not very surprising since the time histories of the NAO and other drivers of the residual AMOC component are implicitly integrated into the residual AMOC component of the past. Additionally, the initialization of the AMOC has been shown to be a useful source of decadal predictability of, if there are any, potential internal oscillations 57 . A similar result is found from the 22 CMIP6 preindustrial runs (Fig.  5e ). However, the autocorrelation from the 30-ensemble SPEAR, which has the zero-crossing at the time lead-lag of around 10-year, is significant only for the subsequent 1-6 years (Fig.  5f ). Based on the above result, the values of the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N averaged for each decade from 1850 to 2020 are plotted against the values of the residual AMOC component for the corresponding subsequent 1-5 years (Fig.  5g ). For instance, the residual AMOC component averaged for 2005-14 is plotted against the residual AMOC component averaged for 2015-19. As expected, the residual AMOC component during a past decade appears to be useful for predicting the residual AMOC component in the subsequent 1-5 years. The mean slope is about 0.8. This means that if the residual AMOC component value of +2.2 Sv for 2015-21 is used (Fig.  1a ), the expected value of the residual AMOC component during 2022-26 is about +1.7 ± 1.1 Sv, yielding a reduction of −0.5 ± 1.1 Sv. According to CMIP6, the residual AMOC component is reduced from +1.3 Sv in 2015-21 to +1.0 ± 1.1 Sv in 2022-25 (Fig.  5h ), yielding a reduction of −0.3 ± 1.1 Sv. Similarly, according to SPEAR, the residual AMOC component is reduced from +1.9 Sv to +1.0 ± 1.3 Sv (Fig.  5i ), yielding a reduction of −0.9 ± 1.3 Sv. Therefore, we can conclude based on the above analysis that the highly elevated state of the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N in 2020 is unlikely to dissipate away during the next several years. See Supplementary Table  4  for more details. The autocorrelation-based estimates should not be used as an actual decadal prediction tool because there are skillful decadal dynamic forecast systems with realistic initializations of the ocean 58 – 60 . Nevertheless, the global annual-to-decadal climate synthesis report issued by the World Meteorological Organization 61  predicted that the total AMOC around 30°N in 2023–27 is likely to be near or slightly below the recently observed values, largely in agreement with our conclusion."
145,discussion,"Discussion In an effort to attribute the interdecadal AMOC evolution during the historical period to the anthropogenic and natural signals, we analyze a suite of climate and surface-forced ocean model simulations along with direct observational data. As summarized in Fig.  6  (see also Supplementary Figs.  9  and  10 ), the weakening of the AMOC since 2000, which is evident from the surface-forced ocean model simulations, is primarily driven by the external forcing (i.e., increased CO 2  and reduced aerosol loading) and is partly compensated by an increase in the natural component. Focusing on the recent period of direct observations, the AMOC remains nearly unchanged from 2010 to 2020 because the externally forced component and the natural component largely compensate for each other. Further analysis indicates that the natural AMOC component increases mainly during three interdecadal periods from 1980 to 1990, from 1990 to 2000, and from 2010 to 2020 in response to the development of strong positive NAO in 1990, its time-integrated & delayed impact in 2000, and the development of another strong positive NAO in 2020, respectively. Lastly, we show that the highly elevated residual AMOC component at 26.5°N in 2020 is unlikely to dissipate away during the next several years. Fig. 6 The rates of interdecadal change in the AMOC components. The rates of interdecadal change (shades) in ( a – d ) the residual, ( e – h ) externally forced, and ( i – l)  total Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) components  d ,  h ,  l  from 1975-84 to 1985-94,  c ,  g ,  k  from 1985-94 to 1995-2004,  b ,  f ,  j  from 1995-2004 to 2005-14, and  a ,  e ,  i  from 2005-14 to 2015-21, derived from OMIP2 and the ensemble-mean CESM2. The contours indicate the time averaged total AMOC derived by averaging that of OMIP2 and CESM2. The residual AMOC component for 2015-21 is obtained by regressing the residual AMOC component on the index of the residual AMOC component at 26.5°N. The units are  Sv  (10 6 
 m 3 sec −1 ) per decade. There remain many outstanding questions that require further investigations. For instance, it is not explored in this study through what processes or pathways the external forcing drives the weakening of the AMOC since 2000. Previous studies point to several such pathways, including reduced ocean-to-air turbulent heat fluxes over the Greenland and Iceland Seas due to rapidly rising air temperatures 62 , a potential impact of retreating sea-ice cover along the regional boundary currents in the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas 63 , and a spreading of Arctic freshwater through Fram and David Straits 64 , 65 . A freshening of the Labrador Sea after the mid-1990s due to enhanced melting of Greenland’s ice sheet has been also suggested as another pathway through which external forcing could drive the weakening of the AMOC 66 , although this process is missing in the climate and ocean models used in this study. Thus, it is important to further investigate if and to what extent the above-listed pathways of external forcing influence the anthropogenic weakening of the AMOC in climate and ocean models. As discussed and shown in our analysis, natural interdecadal AMOC variability appears to be predominantly driven by the NAO. However, in the climate models analyzed in this study, only a small portion of the interdecadal AMOC variance can be explained by the NAO (Fig.  5a–c ). Although this may be due to deficiencies in those models 42 , it is important to note that the NAO is not the only factor contributing to natural interdecadal AMOC variability. It is also possible that unforced internal ocean processes may also influence interdecadal AMOC variability 67 – 73 . Indeed, a hydrographic-data constrained model reconstruction of the AMOC 30  shows somewhat different interdecadal AMOC evolution from that in OMIP2. Thus, further research is needed to identify the role of climate modes of variability other than the NAO, such as East Atlantic Pattern 74 , 75 , in natural interdecadal AMOC variability, and to better understand unforced internal AMOC variability and its interaction with the NAO-forced interdecadal AMOC variability. Several key limitations in this study should be discussed. First of all, the main conclusions in this study heavily rely on OMIP2 and the climate models used (i.e., CESM2, CMIP6 and SPEAR), but these models have limitations stemming from the lack of land-ice melting, and the insufficient model resolution for representing boundary currents, deep water formation, and mesoscale eddies. Additionally, OMIP2 and the climate models used simulate somewhat different mean states of the AMOC during the historical period considered (Methods and Supplementary Tables  1 – 3 ). This and other inconsistencies between OMIP2 and the climate models used and the biases in those models make it challenging to further investigate physical processes involving the natural and externally forced interdecadal evolutions of the AMOC. Another important limitation of this study is that the historical AMOC field derived from OMIP2 is not the actual observation, but a proxy that cannot be easily validated since there is no direct continuous observation prior to April 2004. For instance, previous modeling studies do not agree on the interdecadal evolution of the AMOC in response to the excessive deep convection in the Labrador Sea in the 1990s 26 , 27 , 29 . It is also worthwhile to point out that the impact of anthropogenic aerosol on the AMOC is relatively unclear because of a large uncertainty in representing the indirect aerosol effect (i.e., aerosol-cloud radiative forcing) in climate models 17 , 76 . As such, a large uncertainty still remains in the time series of the AMOC derived from OMIP2 and the externally forced AMOC component derived from the climate models used 17 . Due to the above-listed limitations, the conclusions presented in this study should be taken with caution. There are some other limitations that can be addressed by additional modeling and analysis studies. In particular, it is implicitly assumed in this study that the externally forced and natural AMOC components are linearly separable and thus independent from each other. This is valid only because the externally forced AMOC component used in this study is the ensemble-mean AMOC field derived from many model realizations or multi-models, and thus is predetermined. However, in reality, the external forcing and natural atmosphere-ocean-ice variability interact with each other both linearly and nonlinearly. It is also important to point out that the composite analysis derived from the CESM2 ensembles does not account for the actual amplitude of the residual AMOC component or the NAO-induced surface buoyancy flux; thus, not all aspects of the residual AMOC component and its decadal variation can be readily explained by the composite analysis. To address these limitations, we recommend three sets of specially designed ensemble ocean or fully coupled model experiments, with the first set forced with the observed NAO variability only, the second set with external forcing only, and the third set with both observed NAO variability and external forcing, similar to those described in ref.  40 . Such experiments, carried out preferably using multiple high-resolution models, may allow us to address additional outstanding questions involving natural and externally forced ocean processes and the potential interactions between the two. Lastly, it is worthwhile to briefly discuss a potential collapse of the AMOC suggested in several recent studies 77 – 79 . While such a cascade mechanism triggered by a substantial freshening in the subpolar North Atlantic is well founded by a sound theory 80 , the current state-of-the-art climate models including those analyzed in this study do not show a complete shutdown of the AMOC during the 21st century 23 . However, it should be noted that future freshening of the North Atlantic due to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and land-based glaciers and ice caps in the Arctic circle is not adequately represented in those models. Thus, it is important to continue improving climate models by incorporating realistic scenarios of the Greenland ice sheet melting to address this low likelihood-high impact possibility. Additionally, to further advance our capability to detect and attribute the historical AMOC and to predict the future AMOC, it is vital to continue monitoring the AMOC at multiple latitudes, advance our understanding of the relevant physical processes, and improve climate models and reconstructions of the historical AMOC."

147,intro,"Introduction The Piacenzian/Gelasian transition (P/G transition; ~2.6 Ma) has long been acknowledged as a crucial period in the recent evolution of Earth’s climate, as it marks the beginning of a global cooling that peaked with the definitive onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG; “Icehouse period” in [ 1 ]) in the early Gelasian. Following a long interval of weak climate variability known as the “warm Pliocene”, referred to by many as a potential near-future analogue (i.e., [ 2 ]), the P/G transition developed through multiple cooling phases between ca. 2.8 and 2.4 Ma (namely, from MIS G1 to MIS 96), the aftermaths of which have been demonstrated to vary regionally. The establishment of large ice caps in the Northern Hemisphere is well documented in the North Atlantic marine sedimentary record, where the periodic deposition of Ice Rafted Detritus (IRD) was first detected at around 2.7 Ma [ 3 ]. The event is also marked by massive accumulation of loess in China since ca. 2.6 Ma, severe cooling in Northwestern Europe at around 2.5 Ma, and the influx of sub-Antarctic mollusks in New Zealand at ca. 2.4 Ma [ 4 ]. In the Mediterranean area, significant cooling events are reported to have occurred close to the base of the Gelasian Stage, at around 2.6 Ma [ 1 ,  5 ]. The NHG beginning is epitomized in δ 18 O records globally by a triplet of severe glacial periods (i.e., MIS 100 –MIS 98 –MIS 96; [ 6 ]), which provide a conspicuous marker for the event [ 7 ,  8 ]. In recent years the central Mediterranean region, particularly the Monte San Nicola area (MSN hereafter; Sicily, Southern Italy), where the GSSP of the Gelasian was established [ 9 ], has become the focus of integrated stratigraphic studies aimed at reconstructing the climatic and environmental responses of the central Mediterranean to the NHG onset and intensification [ 5 ,  10 – 13 ]. In addition to the expected orbitally-driven glacial-interglacial variability, ongoing investigations reveal a spectrally complex mixture of prominent cycles in the suborbital (i.e., millennial) time domain. So far, the short-term variability was only recognized based on the benthic record, initially for the MIS 100 glacial [ 11 ] and, more recently, for the interval between ca. 2632 and 2498 ka [ 13 ]. Here, we present the first high-resolution record of alkenone-derived SSTs and δ 18 O of  G .  ruber  from a complete sedimentary sequence on the “Mandorlo” section of [ 12 ], located in the Western sector of MSN, providing evidence of the major climatic and environmental changes that occurred across the Piacenzian-Gelasian boundary."
148,materials|methods,"Materials and methods The area of interest is in the Western sector of the Monte San Nicola badland area, located in Southern Sicily, ca. 10 km north of the coastal town of Gela ( Fig 1 ). The site offers a wide exposure of the upper Piacenzian to lower Calabrian stratigraphy, which consists of a ca. 80 m thick stack of open-marine muds [ 12 ]. Four individual clusters of Mediterranean Precession Related Sapropels (MPRS) are present, these being clusters O–A (ca. 3 to 2.6 Ma), and B–C (ca. 2.3 to 1.6 Ma; [ 14 – 16 ], which also allow for long-distance correlations. 10.1371/journal.pone.0310684.g001 Fig 1 Geographical and geological context.

The thin orange line marks the Piacenzian/Gelasian boundary (Plio/Pleistocene as well). Modified from [ 13 ]. For this work, we employed the sample set previously studied by [ 13 ], which was collected in the lower part of the “Mandorlo” section of [ 12 ]. The section, located close to the profile studied by 11], has been demonstrated to be more suitable and reliable for paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic investigations than the historical “Type” section, where the Gelasian GSSP was established [ 9 ,  17 ], which is poorly exposed and faulted in the interval above the Piacenzian/Gelasian boundary [ 12 ]. We analyzed a total of 200 samples collected with a steady sampling resolution of 5 cm along a 10 m-long profile by pinpointing the top of sapropel A5 (the so-called “Nicola bed”, marking the base of the Gelasian Stage) as our reference zero level. We extended our investigation downward to the top of sapropel A4 (-3 m, 2632 ka [ 13 ]) and upward to +7 m, reaching just above the dark clayey layer associated to i-cycle 242 (2498 ka [ 13 ]). The age model used here is that previously presented in [ 13 ], which was assessed by linear interpolation among 9 tie-points provided by distinctive peaks in the δ 18 O record of  Uvigerina  spp. and/or sapropel layers (A2 –A5 [ 13 ]). Based on the estimated sediment accumulation rate of ca. 7 cm/kyr across this stratigraphic interval [ 13 ], our SST record is likely to allow for a temporal resolution of ca. 0.7 kyr, suitable to investigating the suborbital climate variability. C 37  alkenones analysis and calibration Alkenones are long-chain lipid compounds produced by coccolithophorid algae [ 18 ] that, in the Pleistocene, are believed to be mainly represented by  G .  oceanica  and  G .  caribbeanica  [ 19 ,  20 ]. They are synthesized with different unsaturation degrees based on local environmental conditions, being C 37:3  and C 37:4  typical of cold waters, and C 37:2  abundant in warmer waters [ 21 ]. SST estimates can be obtained by means of a simple calibration equation [ 22 ]. For this study, alkenones were extracted following the standard procedure described by [ 23 ] based on [ 24 ], as described in  S1 Text . Analyses were performed at the Bio-Geochemistry laboratory of the Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) of Lisbon, using a SCION 435 Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Septum Programmable Injector (SPI) and a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). The analytical error is expected to generate an uncertainty in the SST estimates on the order of ±0.5°C and data replicability is extremely high, as the duplicate analysis of 20 random samples throughout the section yielded a negligible dispersion of the analytical results. Among the numerous equations that are used to derive U K’ 37  SST estimates [ 22 ,  25 – 29 ], we opted for that of Müller [ 22 ]  ( C 37 : 2 C 37 : 2 + C 37 : 3 ) . because: 1) it is currently the most widely employed, thus best assessed, calibration method; 2) temperature estimates obtained using Müller’s equation proved to fit the measured SSTs in the modern Mediterranean basin [ 30 – 32 ]; 3) it allows for a direct comparison between our record and those previously reconstructed for the central Mediterranean [ 5 ], likewise based on Müller’s equation; 4) estimates obtained by means of Müller’s calibration are intermediate between those provided by [ 28 ,  29 ]. Oxygen stable isotopes analysis For δ 18 O analyses, 8 to 10 specimens of the planktic foraminifer  G .  ruber  were hand-picked from the 250–350 μm size fraction and subjected to a cleaning treatment protocol [ 33 ] in order to remove any contaminant, such as clay or organic remains. Foraminifer tests were then crushed in glass vials, soaked in hydrogen peroxide (3%) for 30 minutes then soaked in acetone within an ultrasound bath for 30–60 seconds; finally, they were dried in oven at 50°C for 12 hours. All isotopic analyses were carried out at the isotopic ratio mass spectrometer laboratory of the Department of Geosciences of the University of Padova by means of a Thermo Scientific Delta V Advantage mass spectrometer equipped with an automated continuous flow Gas Bench II device. Sample acidification was performed at 70°C. Every 30 samples, an internal standard for quality control (Monzoni marble with δ 18 O values = -10.44 and δ 13 C values = 0.68) was measured; a second standard for calibration (Carrara marble with δ 18 O values = -1.15 and δ 13 C values = 2.58) was measured every 7 samples or less. The external error, derived by repeated measures of a quality control standard, is better than 0.10 ‰ for δ 18 O values. The isotopic results are expressed as permil (‰) on the VPDB scale. Spectral analysis The analysis of non-stationary (frequency changes with time) and non-linear signals was performed on the SST record. Spectrum and wavelet images were produced both for the SSTs raw signal and for each of its identified relevant components (i.e., wave function), as well as for the planktic δ 18 O record (see  S2 Text ). This approach was conducted by applying the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm (EEMD) by [ 34 ], which consists of an adaptive noise-assisted data analysis method, based on the assumption that any complicated signal can be decomposed into a finite, often small, number of components, also known as “Intrinsic Mode Functions” (IMFs) [ 35 ]. The decomposition technique represents a powerful method to study the different processes behind a given time series data and separates short time scale events (signal components) from a general trend, thus allowing for the recognition of signals in the sub-Milankovian time domain that are otherwise obscured by the dominant Milankovitch periodicity (e.g., obliquity). Each IMF represents an embedded characteristic simple oscillation on a separated timescale. IMF components were analyzed with “REDFIT” [ 36 ] and wavelet transform (wt).

149,conclusions,"Results and discussion High-resolution SST evolution across the P/G boundary SST estimates for the “Mandorlo” section are plotted in  Fig 2 . The mean U K’ 37  value in our record is 0.91, and alkenone-derived SSTs range between 19.8°C and 28.2°C. Long-term patterns in our record ( Fig 2E ) are in keeping with the oscillations documented for both the local and global benthic δ 18 O curves ( Fig 2A and 2B , respectively), suggesting that regional SSTs across the interval of relevance were mainly driven by orbital obliquity. Between ca. 2632 ka (late MIS G2 interglacial) and ca. 2532 ka (late MIS 101 interglacial), SST values remained high (25°C to 28°C) with minor oscillations only ( Fig 2E ). The sole relevant exceptions are documented at ca. 2570 ka (early MIS 102 glacial), when temperatures decreased to ca. 23°C, and ca. 2540 ka (inception of MIS 100), when after a 6–7°C drop the central Mediterranean SSTs reached as low as 19–20°C. The latter event persisted for approximately 22 kyr and was characterized by a strong climatic instability, as demonstrated by six sub-millennial excursions in the SST record ( Fig 2E ). Synchronous, consistent oscillations are also documented in the local benthic δ 18 O record ( Fig 2B ; [ 11 ,  13 ]). 10.1371/journal.pone.0310684.g002 Fig 2 Paleoclimatic records for the “Mandorlo” section.

Long-term (orbital) SST variability The alkenone-derived SST record reconstructed for the “Mandorlo” section oscillate in keeping with the obliquity-driven glacial-interglacial variability, as described by the local benthic δ 18 O record ([ 13 ];  Fig 2B ). As expected, glacial and interglacial periods correspond to lower and higher SSTs, respectively ( Fig 2 ). SST oscillations in the older part of our record (MIS G2 to early MIS 103;  Fig 2E ) are weak, suggesting that central Mediterranean temperatures barely responded to the Late Piacenzian glacial-interglacial variability. In correspondence with sapropel A5 (the “Nicola bed”) in MIS 103, temperatures attain a prominent maximum (~28°C) that persist up to ca. 2576 ka ( Fig 2E ). SSTs fall to ~23°C during the overlying MIS 102, which offers the first evidence of severe cooling in our record. Correlation with the SST reconstruction of [ 5 ] up to this stratigraphic level is not straightforward ( Fig 2 ), possibly due to the different data resolution and age models (see  S3 Text  for discussion). Temperatures rose rapidly by 2–5°C at the beginning of interglacial MIS 101, followed by a ~14 kyr-long warm period (2554–2540 ka) with SSTs persistently close to 27°C, despite two weak cooling events before reaching the climate optimum at 2548 ka. The inception of MIS 100, commonly referred to as the NHG beginning [ 8 ], is marked by a severe drop in SSTs. For the first time in our record, Mediterranean surface temperatures fall below the 23°C threshold with a minimum of 19.8°C at ca. 2521 ka. Our SST record reveals that the long MIS 100 glaciation was characterized by an exceptional high-frequency climate variability, as testified by [ 11 ], similar to that documented for the last glacial period (MIS 2; [ 41 ,  42 ]). The termination of MIS 100 is marked by a stepwise increase in regional temperatures, culminating in the reestablishment of SSTs in the order of 27°C at the beginning of interglacial MIS 99 (ca. 2506–2497 ka). Spectral analysis performed on the SST raw signal data ( Fig 3 ) unraveled the pervasive presence of a strong component with a ca. 47 kyr periodicity, thus suggesting—as previously noted by [ 5 ]—that the orbital obliquity forcing played a predominant role in driving the SST changes since the beginning of the Gelasian. This conclusion is further validated by the Wavelet record generated on the raw signal ( Fig 3 ), showing that periodicities in the 32–40 kyr time domain became dominant beginning at ca. 2590 ka. 10.1371/journal.pone.0310684.g003 Fig 3 Spectral and wavelet analysis of the raw alkenone-derived SST signal.

Multi-proxy approach to sea surface conditions The planktic δ 18 O record for  G .  ruber  ( Fig 2C ) shows an array of pronounced oscillations that can be interpreted as a geochemical signature of the regional environmental and climatic variability. In agreement with the benthic δ 18 O record of  Uvigerina  spp., higher planktic δ 18 O values characterize glacial MIS 104 and MIS 100. Still, oscillations in the δ 18 O record of  G .  ruber  proves to be largely independent of those documented in both the benthic δ 18 O and SST records ( Fig 2 ). Records reconstructed for the central Mediterranean region (e.g., [ 43 ] and references within) prove that the isotopic record for  G .  ruber  is predominantly affected by local hydrological conditions, such as the evaporation/precipitation ratio and freshwater budgets, which primarily respond to orbital precession (see Spectral analysis in  S2 Text ). Specifically, peaks of lower values in our δ 18 O G . ruber  record correspond to sapropel layers A5, A4/5 and A4, which formed under conditions of increased stratification of the water column in response to periods of massive precession-driven freshwater runoff [ 16 ,  44 ]. Our record confirms that the δ 18 O G .  ruber  evolution in the Central Mediterranean is mainly shaped by precession-related changes in surface salinity, rather than glacioeustasy [ 45 ]. SST fluctuations at the suborbital scale Superimposed on the dominant orbitally-driven climate variability, the SST record presented here contains high-frequency oscillations that are generally more pronounced during glacial intervals ( Fig 2A and 2E ). In contrast with the overall temperature stability of the Late Pliocene and early Gelasian, several major oscillations in the SST record are found within the MIS 100 glacial (Figs  2E  and  4A ). This pattern is believed to mark the beginning of a strong millennial-scale climate instability across the Early Pleistocene glacial periods [ 46 ]. Spectral analyses revealed the presence of two main suborbital periodicities centered on the 10–6 kyr (IMF3 component) and 8–4 kyr (IMF2) band periodicities (Figs  5  and  6 ). In particular, the 10.9 kyr periodicity appears slightly more prominent than the 8.5 kyr, while the 5 kyr peak stands out as the most prominent within the 8–4 kyr band ( Fig 6 ). Wavelet analyses computed for the IMF3 component confirm the persistence of a strong 10–6 kyr (~8 kyr) periodicity within the SST record ( Fig 5 ).  Fig 6  presents the signal power in the 8–4 kyr band (~5 kyr), showing similarities with the wavelet for the benthic δ 18 O record [ 13 ]. Both the SST and δ 18 O records show a prominent peak in the ~5 kyr band during MIS 100 that, to a lesser extent, is also well documented within glacial MIS 104 and MIS 102. In particular, the 5 kyr signal is best expressed within the MIS 104 –G1 interval for both the benthic and planktic δ 18 O records ( Fig 4B and 4C ), while it is centered on glacial MIS 104, MIS 102 and MIS 100 for the SST record ( Fig 6 ). Evidence of a suborbital (millennial) climate variability with a 5–8 kyr periodicity at MSN, fully comparable to that recognized in the benthic δ 13 C and δ 18 O records of [ 13 ], was first reported by [ 11 ] for the interval straddling MIS 100 in a section adjacent to the “Mandorlo” section of [ 12 ] ( Fig 4 ). More recently, an 8-kyr periodicity was also discovered in the coccolithophorid dataset from the same “Mandorlo” section [ 47 ], further emphasizing that this suborbital periodicity is a pervasive signal at MSN. 10.1371/journal.pone.0310684.g004 Fig 4 Climate variability at the suborbital scale.

Bottom right: wavelet analysis showing that said periodicities occur throughout but become stronger during the glacial stages, especially in MIS 100 (the signal power scale is reported on the far right: red = stronger, blue = weaker). Top: the SST IMF2 component spectrum. Periodicities in the 8–5 kyr band have been previously detected in various paleoclimatic records for the Last Glacial Maximum both in high-latitude regions of the Atlantic Ocean [ 48 ], mid-latitude areas of the Pacific [ 49 ], and low-latitude sectors of the Mediterranean Sea [ 11 ,  50 ,  51 ]. [ 49 ] unraveled a periodicity of ~8 kyr in the alkenone-derived SST record of the Okhotsk Sea over the past 120 kyr, which was correlated to the dynamics of the Pacific Climate Index (PCI). [ 51 ] report on comparable cyclicities (~5 and 8 kyr) over the last 50 kyr. They consist in abundance fluctuations of  N .  pachyderma  (SST proxy) and steppe pollen (aridity proxy) in the Western Mediterranean [ 52 ], which are interpreted as correlative to Henrich Events in the North Atlantic, and oscillations in the  n - hexacosanol/n-nonacosane  (AP) index (proxy of deep-water ventilation; [ 50 ]), tracking the Greenland PCI index (i.e., changes in the intensity of the high-latitude atmospheric circulation). [ 50 ,  51 ] explained the occurrence of suborbital signals in the Mediterranean across the last glacial period as the regional response to changes in the strength of the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) upon the NHG intensification. Previous works interpreted the high-frequency climatic events identified in the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene as analogues of the Late Pleistocene Dansgaard-Oeschger events and the Holocene Bond cycles [ 53 ]. More specifically, [ 54 ] demonstrated that the Henrich-like events found in Site U1313 (North Atlantic) between 960 and 320 ka correlate with episodes of ice calving from the Laurentide Ice Sheet and icesheet accretion (i.e., NHG intensification) at the end of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. A similar mechanism was invoked by [ 11 ] for explaining the high-frequency oscillations found in the benthic δ 18 O record of MIS 100 at MSN, as later confirmed by North Atlantic sedimentary records ([ 3 ,  55 ];  Fig 4E and 4B . Finally, the record of  Florisphaera profunda  at MSN by [ 47 ] shows numerous oscillations within MIS 100 that are in phase with both the record of IRD deposition in the North Atlantic and the “stadial” episodes found in the SST record presented here. Orbital variations may impact suborbital changes through rapid processes, such as sea ice dynamics, as well as through slower changes in ice sheet volume and, consequently, eustasy [ 46 ]. Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene glaciations were characterized by decreasing temperatures and increasing productivity in surface waters of the North Atlantic [ 56 ], suggesting that the North Atlantic Current (NAC) weakened and the Artic Front (AC) underwent a southward migration. During periods of intensified NHG, the NAC was likely subjected to predominant east-west flows, with limited meridional heat transport and cooling at higher latitudes. The overgrowth and destabilization of continental ice caps in the Northern Hemisphere promoted periods of massive iceberg rafting and amplification of the climate variability at the millennial (suborbital) time scale, which we deem responsible for the short-term palaeotemperature fluctuations observed at MSN. Global Circulation Models for the last glacial periods suggest that events of AMOC slowdown/shutdown would promote cooling throughout the whole Northern Hemisphere [ 57 ,  58 ], including the Mediterranean basin, while the Polar Circulation Index would strengthen the atmospheric circulation over the region [ 50 ,  51 ,  59 ]. Accordingly, the AMOC can be identified as an effective mechanism for suborbital climate regulation at the hemispheric scale, even in the earliest stages of NHG. Short-term cooling/warming events (“Millennial Climate Variability” in [ 46 ]) may be the result of multiple interactions of internal/external forcing, such as direct effects of insolation, increase/decrease in continental ice volume, changes in sea level and, consequently, rapid changes in the AMOC strength [ 60 ]. Still, suborbital climatic oscillations recognized in Atlantic records such as the IODP Sites U1313 (North Atlantic; [ 61 ,  62 ]) and U1385 (Iberian margin; [ 63 ,  64 ]), have been interpreted as the response to different source mechanisms than those discussed above. In fact, millennial-scale climate instability in mid-latitude regions might have been promoted by precession-related insolation changes in low-latitude areas echoing/resonating back as harmonics of the main ~21 kyr signal (second and fourth harmonics, respectively; in our case, ~10.9 and ~5 kyr), in keeping with the periodicities found at MSN. Considering the available information, both the models discussed above are believable, and further independent data will be necessary to settle the matter."
150,conclusions,"Conclusions The ~134 kyr long paleoclimate records presented here allowed reconstructing the first high-resolution paleotemperature record across the Piacenzian-Gelasian boundary for the central Mediterranean region. By comparison to the local benthic δ 18 O record, it was established that the main oscillations documented in our SST record reflect the obliquity-driven glacial-interglacial climate variability that is known to dominate throughout the interval of relevance. In addition, spectral analyses enabled the identification of suborbital oscillations, among which two (namely, ~5 and ~8 kyr) were detected in many paleoclimatic records for both the Mediterranean and the open ocean [ 49 ,  51 ,  54 ,  60 ]. The interval corresponding to the MIS 100 glaciation is characterized by an unprecedented collapse in Mediterranean SSTs and a strong climatic instability within. Here, a prominent signal was detected of SST fluctuations in the ~5 kyr time domain, which may either reflect the dynamics of the North Atlantic in response to the periodic overgrowth and destabilization of Arctic icecaps, with temporary disruption of the AMOC, or the regional response to precession-driven subtropical processes. The available data cannot provide a conclusive response to the matter, and further research will be necessary to elucidate the very origins of the suborbital cycles that are documented to occur across the Early Pleistocene interval."

152,introduction,"INTRODUCTION The change in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) stands as a pivotal tipping element of Earth system, substantially influencing global climate by redistributing vast amounts of energy ( 1 – 5 ). The shutdown of this circulation has been associated with past abrupt climate changes [e.g., as evident in paleoclimate records ( 6 ,  7 ), such as playing crucial role in driving glacial-interglacial transitions ( 8 – 10 )]. Continuous monitoring indicates a current decline in AMOC strength in the North Atlantic, although the interpretation of this trend is subject to debate due to natural climate variability ( 11 – 13 ). Nonetheless, some contemporary proxies support the argument of the AMOC weakening, suggesting that its current intensity is the lowest in the past few hundred years ( 12 ,  14 ). Amid anthropogenic warming, advanced climate models project a continued AMOC weakening throughout the 21st century ( 15 ), yet an abrupt collapse within this timeframe seems unlikely, as per the findings of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) ( 16 ). Nevertheless, the potential for an AMOC collapse remains beyond this century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise ( 17 ). Climate impacts induced by an AMOC slowdown have been widely explored through numerical experiments ( 2 ,  3 ,  17 – 19 ). These experiments, known as water-hosing experiments, involve the introduction of additional freshwater fluxes uniformly distributed over deep water formation regions to artificially weaken the AMOC in climate models ( 20 – 23 ). The subpolar North Atlantic is a common region for conducting water-hosing experiments due to its role as a deep water formation region for the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), a crucial component of the AMOC. Results from water-hosing experiments over the North Atlantic consistently indicate that a shutdown or weakening of the AMOC leads to large-scale climate impacts, including a cooling across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), an expansion of Arctic sea ice, and a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). However, the homogeneity and heterogeneity of regional climate responses to an AMOC slowdown remain unclear, yet they are crucial for a better understanding of paleoclimatic records and the assessment of regional societal impacts. Emerging research on the potential attribution of AMOC slowdown provides a scientific basis for conducting numerical water-hosing experiments. The location and transport patterns of input freshwater fluxes may lead to different climatic responses ( 21 ,  22 ,  24 ,  25 ). Several factors have been proposed as potential freshwater sources for the future decline of the AMOC, including the reduction of Arctic sea ice ( 26 ) and melting land ice sheets around Greenland ( 27 ). The concurrent decline of Arctic sea ice and AMOC variations may conceal a two-way interaction between these processes, as suggested in ( 28 ). Arctic sea ice loss can weaken the AMOC after a multi-decadal delay, primarily through the downstream propagation of positive buoyancy anomalies to the subpolar North Atlantic ( 29 ). Conversely, an AMOC weakening can expand Arctic sea ice cover within several years by reducing northward heat transport. This interaction could operate independently of anthropogenic forcing, as an AMOC slowdown can mitigate Arctic sea ice loss and delay the onset of summer ice-free conditions in a warming climate ( 3 ). However, the role of land ice melting is still uncertain. Many climate models predict a weakened AMOC even without fully considering freshwater fluxes from melting land ice ( 2 ,  30 ). From the perspective of paleoclimate records, the influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic is believed to be a key driver of the most abrupt historical changes in the AMOC ( 6 ,  25 ,  31 ). However, identifying the crucial regions where an increase in freshwater fluxes leads to the substantial decline in the AMOC is still a topic of ongoing discussion and lacks consensus based on both observations and climate models ( 24 ,  31 – 34 ). In addition, current climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show different abilities to capture and project AMOC strength, leading to considerable uncertainties between the models. All in all, identifying key regions that drive AMOC variability could enhance climate models by improving regional resolution and accounting for the associated physical and dynamical processes. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art global climate model, the Alfred Wegener Institute Climate Model (AWI-CM3) ( 35 ), to reexamine the sensitivity of the AMOC to various water-hosing regions in the North Atlantic. This investigation is motivated by recent observations emphasizing the importance of the Irminger Sea in influencing AMOC dynamics ( 34 ,  36 ). We explore both the homogeneous and heterogeneous climate impacts associated with an AMOC slowdown across different water-hosing regions."
153,results,"RESULTS AMOC in control simulations Figure 1A  presents the simulated AMOC in the pre-industrial control (PI-CTR) experiments for each ensemble member and the ensemble mean. The AMOC strength is measured by the annual maximum of the overturning stream function below 500 m in the North Atlantic at 26.5°N. The ensemble time-mean AMOC strength and one SD (σ) is approximately 15.5 ± 0.5 Sverdrups (Sv) throughout the 200 model years. Comparing the pre-industrial simulations with other climate models, our simulated AMOC strength aligns with the range reported across various climate models ( 23 ,  37 ,  38 ), yet this value is slightly below what recent observational studies suggest ( 39 ). Fig. 1. Characteristics of AMOC and poleward heat transport in control simulations. ( A ) Annual-mean time series of AMOC strength (maximum in depth at 26.5°N) across all control experiment ensemble members, alongside the ensemble mean. The blue line represents the reference period, covering model years 40 to 99 (60 years). The gray dashed line denotes the ensemble-time mean of the simulated AMOC strength over the 200 years, with shading indicating SDs (darker for ±1σ, lighter for ±2σ). Ensemble mean of ( B ) the annual mean AMOC stream functions (Sverdrups) and ( C ) mixed layer depth (m) in boreal winter [December, January, and February (DJF)] during the reference period in the control simulation. ( D ) Meridional heat transport during the reference period; shading indicates the ensemble spread as measured by the ±1σ. Notably, the ensemble mean AMOC strength shows a minor upward trend, increasing by 0.2 Sv per century ( P  < 0.01), likely due to temperature drift in the ocean model ( 35 ). Interannual fluctuations among the three ensemble members mostly fall within 2σ of the long-term ensemble time mean. For our analysis, we set the reference period from year 40 to 99, where the AMOC strength averages around 15.4 ± 0.5 Sv. There is also a modest increasing trend approximately 0.1 Sv per century ( P  < 0.01). Testing different reference periods yielded consistent outcomes, confirming the robustness of our choice. Therefore, subsequent discussions of control simulations and differences are based on the defined reference period. Figure 1B  presents the AMOC stream function within the Atlantic/Arctic sector over the reference period, displaying a realistic modern-day overturning circulation ( 2 ). This includes northward transport in the upper 1000 m, on average, with water sinking in the high-latitude North Atlantic before returning southward in a flow between 1000 and 3000 m ( 23 ). The winter season [December, January, and February (DJF)] mixed layer depth, depicted in  Fig. 1C , identifies critical regions of deep water formation in the North Atlantic ( 40 ). These areas are essential for the formation of the NADW, contributing to the returning southwards flow of the AMOC. AWI-CM3 simulations pinpoint major NADW formation sites including the Labrador Sea, the Irminger Sea, southern Greenland, and the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian seas, with the deepest mixed layer depths observed in the Labrador Sea (reaching approximately 3200 m). These depths present a bias from observational data, as highlighted in ( 41 ), although biases in the Nordic Seas and Irminger Sea are notably less pronounced. We further explore oceanic meridional heat transport (MHT), as illustrated in  Fig. 1D . Oceanic heat primarily dominates in the deep tropics and is transported toward higher latitudes, a well-documented characteristic shown in both observational data and climate model analyses ( 42 ,  43 ). Further decomposing the MHT across various basins reveals that, in deep tropics, heat transports from the Indo-Pacific Ocean generally dominates in both hemispheres. Here, the Indo-Pacific’s contribution is more substantial in the Southern Hemisphere [SH; 1.8 petawatt (PW)] compared to the NH (0.9 PW). The MHT within the Atlantic demonstrates overall northward heat transport across the two hemispheres largely facilitated by the AMOC, aligning with its circulation patterns depicted in  Fig. 1B . While the Atlantic substantially affects global MHT in the tropics, it also plays a pivotal role in MHT from mid-latitudes to high latitudes (∼75°N) within the NH. We estimate the Atlantic heat transport at 26.5°N to be around 0.81 ± 0.005 PW, falling short of the observed 1.33 ± 0.4 PW ( 44 ). Despite the challenges posed by global warming and the tendency for a low bias in AMOC simulations, our control simulation provides a credible estimation of the oceanic MHT associated with AMOC. Furthermore, our findings regarding oceanic MHT at both global and basin-specific scales display consistency across different ensemble members. Responses of AMOC in perturbed simulations In response to freshwater perturbations across four designated input regions ( Fig. 2  and Materials and Methods), we note a consistent pattern of initial AMOC strength reduction followed by a recovery phase in all experimental setups (text S1 and figs. S1 and S2). During the period influenced by freshwater, the AMOC strength diminishes to varying degrees, indicating that changes in AMOC variations depend on the freshwater input regions. It is essential to note that these responses are transient and have not reached a state of equilibrium, as expected due to the slow adjustment of the deep ocean ( 45 ). The recovery of AMOC strength, occurring about 50 years after ceasing freshwater injections, corresponds closely with the length of the perturbation period (fig. S1). The recovered AMOC (model year 100 to 200) can either reach the controlled strength or slightly surpass it, possibly due to the overshoot effect (text S1 and fig. S2). In this study, we mainly focus on the transient response of the weakening and recovering AMOC with different sensitive freshwater-perturbed regions during the initial 100 model years. Fig. 2. Four regions for water-hosing experiments and changes in wintertime mixed layer depth. The specified regions are delineated as contours and detailed in table S1: ( A ) Irminger basin (HIM), ( B ) Labrador Sea (HLB), ( C ) Nordic Seas (HNS), and ( D ) North-East Atlantic (HNA). Colored shading illustrates the changes in the wintertime mixed layer depths, indicating as the ensemble mean of the differences observed between the strongest decline period of AMOC and the control experiments. Cross-hatched areas indicate that the regional changes reach statistical significance at the 99% confidence level using a two-sided Student’s  t  test. Analysis of the anomalies in AMOC strength across different experiments reveal a reduction of 20 to 40% at the end of the freshwater perturbations compared to the control simulations ( Fig. 3A ). The largest decline in AMOC appears in the Hosing-Irminger (HIM) experiment, where the Irminger basin is hosed, while the minimal response is found in the Hosing-NorthEast-Atlantic (HNA), where freshwater is injected over the North-East Atlantic. The weakening of AMOC strength appears to occur at a similar pace in the Hosing-Labrador (HLB) and Hosing-Nordic (HNS), where freshwater fluxes are perturbed over the Labrador Sea and Nordic Seas, respectively. In agreement with previous research ( 24 ,  31 ), our results demonstrate that changes in AMOC intensity are generally larger when freshwater is injected directly over the deep water formation regions ( Fig. 1C ). In addition, our findings contribute fresh insights, corroborating observational data that the Irminger basin exhibits a heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in AMOC strength ( 34 ,  36 ). Observations in ( 36 ) noted that colder waters from the Labrador Sea, advected eastward by the subpolar gyre circulation closely controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation, play a crucial role in driving the overturning dynamics within the Irminger basin. Fig. 3. Variations in AMOC strength and poleward heat transport across water-hosing experiments. ( A ) Left panel shows the ensemble mean of AMOC intensity anomalies relative to the reference period. The black dotted line denotes the averaged of all the anomalies over the first 100 model years across all the water-hosing experiments, with gray shadings indicating the SD (darker for ±1σ, lighter for ±2σ). Blue horizontal lines mark the levels of AMOC weakening relative to the reference period. Light blue shading defines the strongest decline period, during which AMOC strength reduces by up to 2σ (approximately 30%) in HIM experiment. The right panel presents probability density functions of AMOC strength during the strongest decline period among different water-hosing experiments. ( B ) Anomalies in the meridional ocean heat transport averaging the strongest decline period of AMOC. ( C ) Hovmöller diagram of the annual mean temperature difference averaged in 0 to 4000-m ocean depth in the Indian Ocean basin relative to the reference period. The vertical red dashed lines indicate the section corresponding to the strongest decline period of AMOC. To further investigate the climate response to a weakened AMOC, we define a period with the strongest decline in AMOC strength. This involves averaging AMOC strength anomalies across all water-hosing experiments over the initial 100 model years ( Fig. 3A ), resulting in an average anomaly of approximately −1.95 ± 1.28 Sv. We define the “strongest decline period” as the span in which the reduction of AMOC intensity falls below −2 σ, observed in experiment where the AMOC shows maximum responsiveness to freshwater perturbation. This critical period is determined to be from the years 29 to 61 (indicated by light blue shading in  Fig. 3A ). We note that the AMOC recovery phase begins after a lag of approximately 5 years following the cessation of freshwater hosing (year 50), which may be linked to the delayed responses between subpolar and subtropical AMOC variations via interior pathways and coastal Kelvin waves ( 46 ). Our subsequent analyses primarily focus on comparing climate responses during this period of the strongest AMOC weakening with the reference period across all water-hosing experiments. During the period of the strongest AMOC decline, the difference in AMOC strength between the HIM and others is statistically significant (right panel in  Fig. 3A ;  P  < 0.01). While the decline in AMOC strength between the HLB and HNS is not statistically significant, the HLB tends to experience more years of extreme AMOC weakening, and the HNS shows a slightly greater overall decline, as indicated by their average values. The relatively smaller AMOC decline in HNA is also significantly different from other experiments ( P  < 0.01). All perturbed experiments result in a significant ( P  < 0.01) reduction in AMOC strength compared to the reference control experiments. In examining the structure of the AMOC cells, all experiments demonstrate a general weakening of the entire AMOC cell and a slight intensification of the bottom reversed cell (fig. S3). A notable observation is the shallowing of the upper AMOC cell, particularly in HIM, where the maximum stream function reduces to approximately 12 to 14 Sv at around 40°N (fig. S3A), marking a decrease of about 4 to 5 Sv. Reduced the North Atlantic deep water formation The weakening of the upper AMOC cell is further evidenced by changes in wintertime mixed layer depth ( Fig. 2 ). The largest decrease in the mixed layer depth is most clear for HIM over the Labrador Sea ( Fig. 2A ), where the climatological maximum mixed layer depth is located ( Fig. 1C ). This reduction leads to shallower deep water formation, correlating with the weakening of the AMOC. Echoing a similar model configuration, Sidorenko  et al.  ( 47 ) highlighted that deep convection in the North Atlantic predominantly occurs in the eastern sectors of the subpolar gyre or further north. This accounts for the greater efficacy of freshwater additions over the Irminger basin in decelerating the AMOC compared to direct injections into the Labrador Sea. In the other experiments, significant shoaling of the mixed layer depth is observed ( Fig. 2, B to D ), with the least pronounced reduction found in HNA ( Fig. 2D ). For HNS, the added freshwater effectively eliminates the mixed layer depth site over the Nordic Seas present in the control simulation ( Fig. 1C ). Notably, the suppression of the convection sites is compensated by a generally increase in mixed layer depth across the subtropical North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The response of the AMOC to freshwater perturbations depends not only on the original location of deep water formation regions but also on the routes through which the hosing water circulates ( 24 ). Reorganization of seasonal atmospheric circulation and changes in surface wind patterns can play crucial roles in redistributing freshwater, thereby affecting the mixed layer depth across different regions. For HIM, a significant increase in mean sea level pressure over the northern high latitudes, along with a noticeable reduction in surface westerlies south of Greenland, is observed ( Fig. 4 ). Instead, this pattern is characterized by enhanced northeasterly winds, particularly in DJF, which directs freshwater from the Irminger Basin toward the Labrador Sea, contributing to the significant decline in mixed layer depth there ( Fig. 2A ). This is consistent with a recent modeling study Zhu and Cheng ( 48 ), which suggests the strong vulnerability of the Labrador Sea to external forcing, likely due to the weak ocean stratification in that region. For HLB, intensified mean sea level pressure is observed, especially over the subpolar gyre region ( Fig. 4, C and D ), facilitating stronger southwesterlies that help transport freshwater to the southern Irminger basin ( Fig. 2B ), leading to a significant shoaling of the mixed layer. In HNS and HNA, changes in atmospheric circulation and wind patterns fail to effectively channel freshwater toward key areas of deep water formation, resulting in limited impacts on AMOC strength ( Fig. 4, E to H ). Fig. 4. Responses of global climate to the weakened AMOC across water-hosing experiments. Shown for ( A  and  B ) HIM, ( C  and  D ) HLB, ( E  and  F ) HNS, and ( G  and  H ) HNA. The variables are displayed as the difference between the ensemble mean of each water-hosing experiment during the strongest decline period of the AMOC and the control experiment for boreal summer [June, July, and August (JJA)] and DJF. Color shadings represent the mean sea level (MSL) pressure, and blue arrows indicate wind vectors at 850 hPa. Cross-hatched areas denote statistically significant differences based on a Student’s  t  test at the 99% significance level for MSL. The contours indicate the sea ice extent, with cyan lines for the control experiment and magenta lines for the water-hosing experiment. The sea ice edge is defined as a sea-ice thickness greater than 0.05 m. Although our simulations suggest that the Labrador Sea is more vulnerable than the Irminger Basin ( Fig. 2A ), direct freshwater input into this region appears less effective at driving an AMOC slowdown. Beyond the wind patterns responses, this discrepancy may arise from the differing contributions of water masses to AMOC formation in these two subpolar regions. Observations indicate that deep water formation in the Labrador Sea may not prominently influence AMOC variability in the subpolar basin ( 49 ). Analysis of AMOC within a density framework, which measures its changes due to variations in surface water mass transformations, suggests that the conversion of northward warm and salty waters into southward colder and fresher deep waters in the Irminger and Iceland basins plays a major role in subpolar AMOC variability. This finding is further supported by recent modeling studies ( 34 ,  50 ). Notably, using the same ocean model [Finite-Volume Sea ice Ocean Model (FESOM)] as in our study, Sidorenko  et al.  ( 50 ) suggested that the waters contributing to the upper limb of the AMOC, where its maximum is located, are primarily formed in the Irminger Sea, with the Labrador Sea contributing to a lesser extent. Conversely, waters from the Labrador Sea largely determine the lower part of the AMOC mid-depth cell, part of which contributes to the recirculation cell. Our findings highlight that the Irminger Basin is particularly effective to freshwater forcings that weaken the AMOC, while the North-East Atlantic demonstrates a lesser degree of sensitivity than other sites of deep water formation regions. The Labrador and Nordic Seas, while similarly sensitive to freshwater disturbances, exhibit distinct mechanisms leading to AMOC weakening. In the Labrador Sea, the reduction in AMOC strength appears to stem from both the shallowing of the mixed layer depth and alterations in atmospheric circulation and wind patterns. Conversely, in the Nordic Seas, the primary factor is the total halt of convection processes. Suppressed and compensated MHT Throughout all water-hosing experiments, there is a notable decrease in global MHT during the strongest decline period of AMOC ( Fig. 3B ). Substantial reductions in MHT span from the tropics to the extratropical areas of the NH, with the largest decrease found in HIM, where the reduction is approximately twice that of the other three experiments. The decline in MHT in the North Atlantic basin predominantly contributes to the global MHT reduction ( Fig. 3B ). However, the Indo-Pacific Ocean displays positive MHT anomalies, suggesting an enhanced northward heat transfer from the Indo-Pacific Ocean basins across the equator to the NH high latitudes. This compensates, in part, for the reduced northward heat transport in the Atlantic, reflecting interbasin MHT compensation under a weakened AMOC, consistent with previous findings from water-hosing experiments in paleoclimate contexts ( 51 ). The enhanced MHT is larger in HIM than in the other experiments, corresponding to the greatest decline in AMOC strength ( Fig. 3A ), underscoring a considerable climate impact, predominantly in the NH. The different responses of the MHT over various ocean basins reflect the interior oceanic pathways connecting the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans ( 52 – 54 ). Further decomposition reveals that the enhanced MHT in the Indo-Pacific Basin is mainly due to increased MHT over the Indian Ocean across all water-hosing experiments (fig. S4), largely due to the import heat from the Southern Ocean ( 55 ). We attribute the anomalous heat transport in the Indian Ocean to changes in circulation and temperature, following ( 55 ). Both factors contribute to the enhanced MHT over the Indian Ocean; however, circulation-driven heat transport anomalies play a dominant role in this process (text S2 and fig. S4). We next examine the vertical structure of temperature evolution over the Indian Ocean ( Fig. 3C ). In response to the weakening AMOC, a consistent warming signal appears for all experiments, characterized by stronger subsurface warming anomalies that gradually intrude into the ocean surface and deep ocean. This warming signal can persist for a long time, even after the AMOC strength recovers. During the strongest decline period of the AMOC, the warming anomalies tend to penetrate the ocean surface and propagate quickly into the deep ocean. This indicates that interior ocean heat exchanges play a crucial role in compensating for the suppressed global MHT. This process partially facilitated the strengthening of subsurface warming in the Indian Ocean, primarily driven by oceanic circulation changes (fig. S4). The increased MHT changes over the Indian Ocean also contributes to heat exports to the Pacific via the weakened Indonesian Throughflow, consistent with the findings of Li and Liu ( 55 ), contributing to warming in the Pacific basin. The Indian Ocean warming induced by the weakened AMOC may diverge from previous studies, such as ( 54 ), which proposed that Indian Ocean warming could enhance AMOC strength by increasing the northward transport of ocean salinity and through atmospheric teleconnections. This discrepancy emphasizes the importance of changes in interbasin connections, not only at the ocean surface but also through interior ocean exchanges, supporting the concept of a thermal interbasin seesaw between the North Atlantic and the subsurface Indo-Pacific ( 53 ,  55 ). Contrast hemispheric response of surface temperature The conspicuous reduction in northward heat transport is intricately linked to a significant cooling across the majority of the NH ( Fig. 5 , fig. S5A, and fig. S6). In contrast, the SH exhibits a slight warming. This observed contrast hemispheric surface temperature response aligns generally with previous studies proposing the “bipolar seesaw pattern” in responses to a slowdown or collapse of the AMOC, especially in experiments involving extensive freshwater hosing over the North Atlantic ( 2 ,  3 ,  18 ,  56 ,  57 ). However, our results reveal that the distinct bipolar seesaw responses in surface temperature may depend on the season and the freshwater injection regions. For example, during June, July, and August (JJA), the bipolar seesaw responses is relatively evident in HIM (fig. S6B) and HLB (fig. S6D) but not in other experiments. Fig. 5. Homogeneity and heterogeneity of surface temperature response. Seasonal response of surface air temperature anomalies averaged among the four water-hosing experiments: ( A ) DJF, ( B ) spring (MAM), ( C ) JJA, and ( D ) autumn (SON). The anomalies for each water-hosing experiment are calculated as the difference between the surface air temperatures during the strongest decline period of the AMOC and the control experiment. Hatched shading (absence of shading) regions indicate heterogeneity (and homogeneity) of temperature changes, signifying differing (similar) warming or cooling responses among the water-hosing experiments. Annotated texts represent the acronyms of each IPCC AR6 reference region (details available in text S3 and fig. S5). Regions outlined in blue denote those with heterogeneous seasonal temperature changes across the water-hosing experiments. Red and blue texts indicate the number of subcontinental regions presenting homogeneous (HOMO) and heterogeneous (HETE) changes, respectively, while the numbers in brackets show the count of affected land regions and ocean basins. Surface temperature presents regional variations in response to a weakened AMOC, previously overlooked. To evaluate both homogeneous and heterogeneous temperature changes at a subcontinental level, our study uses the latest reference regions defined by the IPCC AR6 [text S3 and fig. S5; ( 58 )]. Our comparison of temperature variability across seasons within four different experiments reveals that 86 to 93% of the subcontinental regions undergo homogeneous temperature changes, irrespective of the season ( Fig. 5 ). The most dominant cooling occurs in DJF, particularly over the North Atlantic ( Fig. 5A ), coinciding with the suppressed ocean deep convection ( Fig. 2 ). Warm anomalies predominantly spread over the oceanic regions in the SH, although temperature changes show more heterogeneity, especially in the South Atlantic and Antarctic. Heterogeneous temperature responses tend to increase slightly during DJF and JJA ( Fig. 5,A and C ) compared to March, April, and May (MAM) and September, October, and November (SON) ( Fig. 5, B and D ), likely due to the diverse local effects of different dynamic and physical processes. In the detailed examination of temperature responses during DJF and JJA (fig. S6), heterogeneous temperature changes are observed in some places. Central North America exhibits a notable warming anomaly in DJF in HLB while showing a general cooling in the other experiments. This heterogeneous temperature change explains the heterogeneity of temperature responses in  Fig. 5A  over North America. Moreover, although the cooling is broadly consistent, the intensity of local cooling varies with the freshwater flux injection sites. As in JJA, the HIM induces the most significant cooling across NH land surfaces and in regions with significant deep convection reduction, where the maximum cooling can reach 4° to 6°C (fig. S6A). Other experiments (fig. S6, C, E, and G) show cooling confined to high-latitude land surfaces of northern Eurasia. A noticeable heterogeneous pattern emerges from the Barents Sea to central Eurasia due to a significant warming belt identified in HNA (fig. S6H). In addition, anomalous warming over parts of India and the West African monsoon regions suggests the influence of a weakened AMOC on the global summer monsoon ( 59 ). Associated with the suppressed northward heat transport, a weakened AMOC contribute to the expansion of Arctic sea ice ( Fig. 4  and fig. S7), consistent with findings from ( 28 ). The sea ice expansion may be linked to widespread high-latitude cooling over the NH through the ice-albedo feedback mechanism ( 2 ). In addition, the reduction or cessation of deep convection in the North Atlantic ( Fig. 2 ) could also contribute to sea surface cooling, inhibiting heat transfer from the interior ocean to its surface ( 45 ). Furthermore, the observed cooling extending across both oceanic and land surfaces may also be propelled by other mechanisms, including high-latitude temperature advection facilitated by alterations in atmospheric circulation ( Fig. 4  and figs. S8 and S9) and the interplay of wind-evaporation–sea surface temperature feedbacks ( 60 ). However, the heterogeneous warming signal from HNA during JJA (fig. S6H) could be linked to the regional retreat of sea ice extent ( Fig. 4G  and fig. S7), facilitating positive ice-albedo feedback and influencing the anomalous anticyclone system from the Barents Sea to central Eurasia (fig. S9). Our analysis of the impacts of freshwater inputs from different regions on surface temperatures reveals a complex landscape. We argue that the generally bipolar seesaw pattern in surface temperatures response to a slowdown AMOC seems more overestimated and may depend on the varying locations of freshwater perturbations. The effect on land surface temperatures exhibits a more localized nature. At high latitudes, the ice-albedo feedback mechanism plays a pivotal role in driving temperature variations across local and neighboring land areas. Changes in atmospheric circulation could either intensify or spread these temperature anomalies further. Moreover, an interesting pattern of a consistent warming is observed over India and the southern Sahara during warmer seasons. This warming in India might be tied to a slight increase in MHT within the Indo-Pacific tropics ( Fig. 3, B and C , and fig. S4), while the warming in the southern Sahara could relate to a southward shift of the ITCZ ( 2 ). Homogeneity and heterogeneity precipitation changes In response to a weakened AMOC, changes in atmospheric circulation and surface temperature can modify air-sea heat fluxes. We focus on the changes in annual surface turbulent heat fluxes, including latent and sensible heat fluxes ( Fig. 6 ). The surface turbulent heat flux shows significant negative anomalies, especially over the northern high latitude North Atlantic for HIM. This is mainly due to the significant decrease of surface temperature ( Fig. 5  and fig. S6), changing wind patterns from westerlies to northeasterlies, and the southward extension of sea ice ( Fig. 4  and fig. S7), which together suppress ocean-atmosphere thermal coupling. Slightly positive anomalies in sensible heat flux over the subtropical North Atlantic are linked to a slightly strengthening of the subtropical gyre, as indicated by positive anomalies in the mean sea level pressure and wind patterns ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, annual sea surface temperature anomalies in this region are generally warmer than surface air temperatures ( Fig. 6, E to H ), suggesting that the strengthened gyre and warmer sea surface may partly offset total turbulent heat loss. Moreover, changes in surface turbulent heat fluxes are closely related to the alternations in precipitation. Substantial changes in global precipitation patterns are observed, accompanied by suppressed surface turbulent heat fluxes and atmospheric eddy moisture transport ( 3 ,  61 ). Fig. 6. Response of annual surface turbulent heat fluxes under weakened AMOC over the Atlantic. Differences in ( A  to  D ) latent heat flux (LHF) and ( E  to  H ) sensible heat flux (SHF) for different water-hosing experiments during the strongest decline period of AMOC compared to the control experiment. Cross-hatched areas denote statistically significant differences based on a Student’s  t  test at the 99% significance level. Contour lines in (E) to (H) show the difference between annual sea surface temperature and surface air temperature anomalies. Red, gray, and blue lines indicate where the former is warmer, equal to, or colder than the latter by 0.1°, 0°, and −0.1°C, respectively. Seasonal precipitation changes mirror those in surface temperature and latent heat flux, exhibiting a broadly homogeneous hemispheric contrast ( Fig. 7, A to E ), with drying in the NH and slight wetting in the SH. The NH, especially high-latitude regions, experiences widespread decreases in precipitation, consistent with surface cooling and reduced atmospheric moisture. Notably, the North Atlantic and Gulf Stream show significant decreases in precipitation across all seasons and experiments, especially during DJF and JJA. Conversely, the SH witnesses increased precipitation, particularly over the Amazon basin during JJA and SON, aligning with discussions suggesting that a weakened AMOC could delay or prevent Amazon rainforest dieback ( 62 ). Fig. 7. Homogeneity and heterogeneity of seasonal precipitation changes under weakened AMOC. The relative changes in seasonal precipitation in comparison to control experiments across various seasons: ( A ) DJF, ( B ) MAM, ( C ) JJA, and ( D ) SON. Hatched shading (absence of shading) regions indicate heterogeneity (and homogeneity) of precipitation changes, signifying differing (similar) drying or wetting responses among the water-hosing experiments. Boundaries outlined in red (blue) delineate regions exhibiting homogeneous (heterogeneous) precipitation changes within each IPCC AR6 reference region. ( E ) Illustrates the zonal mean (Z.M.) of precipitation change for each water-hosing experiment, with the dotted line showing the aggregate average of these changes. ( F ) Summaries by continent of the percentage of subregions exhibiting homogeneous and heterogeneous precipitation changes across the global land surface (details available in text S4 and figs. S11 to S16). Zonal mean changes in seasonal precipitation signal a consistent southward shift of the ITCZ ( Fig. 7E  and fig. S10), with decreased precipitation in its northern stretches and increased precipitation to the south. Previous studies have linked this southward migration to variations in hemispheric surface temperature gradients ( 2 ,  61 ), changes in atmospheric energetics ( 3 ), and the impact of strengthened anomalous trade winds ( 63 ). Consequently, this shift has led to pronounced changes in seasonal precipitation patterns across the tropical Atlantic and global monsoon regions, further influenced by the induced anomalous trade winds (figs. S8 and S9). The observed homogeneous precipitation changes underscores the consistent impact of a weakened AMOC, while the diverse outcomes across water-hosing experiments (hatched areas in  Fig. 7 ) highlight the importance of acknowledging heterogeneity. This heterogeneity necessitates comprehensive investigation, especially considering potential societal impacts. We then investigate seasonal precipitation changes at the subcontinental scale, providing detailed insights into the interaction between a weakened AMOC and localized precipitation patterns. The examination of regional precipitation variations across different water-hosing experiments is thoroughly examined for all IPCC AR6–defined regions ( Fig. 7F  and figs. S11 to S16). Briefly, 45 of 58 (35 land and 10 ocean basins) show homogeneous changes during SON ( Fig. 7D ). In contrast, boreal winter ( Fig. 7A ) and summer ( Fig. 7C ) exhibit more variability, with 29 regions showing heterogeneous responses. Most land regions during SON and MAM show generally homogeneous precipitation changes. Heterogeneous precipitation changes across North America are notable for most seasons, highlighting the regional vulnerability to complex precipitation changes under a weakened AMOC. Specifically, northern high-latitude regions, such as Greenland/Iceland and Northern Europe, consistently show reduced precipitation year-round. The tropics display uniform reduction in some monsoon areas, such as Central America and the Caribbean, with increase in northern South America and West Southern Africa. The Sahara and India tend to dry out in warmer seasons and become wetter in colder ones. Mid-latitude regions exhibit predominantly heterogeneous precipitation changes, influenced by seasonal variations and specific water-hosing experiments. Ocean basins largely show homogeneous changes, with precipitation decreasing in the northern oceans and increasing in the tropical Atlantic. The magnitude of these changes depends on the specific water-hosing experiment, with HIM demonstrating the most pronounced seasonal variations, followed by HNS and HLB, and HNA showing the lease impact, reflecting the diverse intensity of AMOC reduction across these experiments ( Fig. 3 ). In summary, large-scale seasonal changes in precipitation show homogeneity, consistent with earlier studies ( 18 ,  20 ,  45 ,  57 ). There is a pronounced reduction in precipitation from the northern mid-latitudes to high latitudes and an increase from the deep tropics to the southern subtropics. However, our results suggest that precipitation patterns within both northern and southern mid-latitude areas exhibit considerable heterogeneity. This variability likely stems from complex interactions within atmospheric circulation changes and the shift of ITCZ induced by the weakened AMOC, further influenced by diverse freshwater sources and seasonal variations. Implications for temperature and precipitation extremes So far, we have investigated the climatic changes induced by the weakened AMOC in response to freshwater input from different regions. These changes could substantially affect regional extreme weather events, depending on the varying regional weather responses ( 64 – 66 ). Given the examined widespread cooling induced by the weakened AMOC, we first investigate its impacts on cold extremes over the global land surface ( Fig. 8 ). In response to general cooling, the cold spell duration index (CSDI; Materials and Methods) presents a broadly increasing pattern. The magnitude of this response depends on the extent of AMOC weakening, which is determined by the freshwater injection regions. Nevertheless, a homogeneous pattern is observed, with an increase in cold spell duration over northern Europe, northern South America, and the Sahara region. Notably, except for HLB, Europe experiences a significant increase in cold spell duration in all other experiments. The result for HLB aligns with ( 65 ), which reveals a decrease in cold spells over Europe, whereas the other three experiments indicate an inconsistent pattern. This inconsistency highlights the importance of identifying key regions in driving AMOC variations, particularly in studying regional manifestations of temperature extremes. Fig. 8. Changes in cold extremes under weakened AMOC in different water-hosing experiments. Cold extremes are measured by the CSDI and shown as the difference between the strongest decline period of AMOC and the control experiment: ( A ) HIM, ( B ) HLB, ( C ) HNS, and ( D ) HNA. Cross-hatched areas denote statistically significant differences based on a Student’s  t  test at the 99% significance level. Heterogeneity in changes induced by different water-hosing experiments also exists in the global hydrological cycle and precipitation extremes ( Fig. 9 ). The hydrological cycle is measured by annual precipitation minus evaporation (P-E), which presents an almost identical climatological pattern ( Fig. 9A ) to the observations in ( 67 ). Homogeneous and heterogeneous changes in P-E reflect changes in global precipitation patterns ( Fig. 7 ), resulting in more heterogeneity over mid-latitude and monsoon regions ( Fig. 9D ). The largest changes prevail over the North Atlantic Ocean, resulting from cooling-suppressed evaporation. Regarding precipitation extremes, we consider the dry spell index [consecutive dry day (CDD);  Fig. 9, B and E ] and the heavy precipitation intensity index (RX5day;  Fig. 9, C and F ). Across different water-hosing experiments, more regional heterogeneity is observed for CDD over northern mid-latitude and South Asian monsoon regions. Although there is a homogeneous decrease in CDD around the Amazon Basin, the heavy precipitation intensity index shows heterogeneous changes there. Our results suggest that precipitation changes induced by a weakened AMOC could lead to varying regional occurrences of drought and flood events, depending on the regions of freshwater release over the North Atlantic.

154,discussion,"DISCUSSION Our study investigates the sensitivity of AMOC slowdown to varying freshwater fluxes from different North Atlantic regions, motivated by growing concerns about the projected AMOC slowdown and potential collapse due to anthropogenic global warming ( 68 ,  69 ). Findings suggest that continuous freshwater fluxes into the Irminger basin exert the most pronounced effect on AMOC weakening, aligning with recent observational studies ( 34 ,  36 ), highlighting the crucial role of the Irminger Sea in modulating AMOC variability. In our water-hosing experiment over the Irminger Sea, we observe a near halt in convection across the Labrador Sea and the Nordic Seas, linked to intensified northeast winds over West Greenland and stronger southwest winds around the eastern subpolar gyre. These conditions likely facilitate the transport of freshwater, inhibiting deep water formation and consequently weakening AMOC strength. The anomalous wind and atmospheric circulation patterns resemble a positive North Atlantic Oscillation–like pattern, contributing to spreading freshwater from the Irminger Sea to the Labrador Sea and Nordic Seas via the subpolar gyre ( 70 – 72 ). We explore the homogeneous and heterogeneous regional climate impacts of a weakened AMOC due to freshwater fluxes from different areas. The large-scale homogeneous climate impacts show a general independence from the regions of freshwater introduction. Notably, climatic impacts are more pronounced when freshwater is added to the Irminger Sea. Across all seasons, we observe consistent NH cooling and SH slight warming, primarily due to reduced northward heat transport in the Atlantic. The cooling is more intense where convection is largely reduced, coinciding with increased sea ice concentration, while mild warming is seen over the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Ocean. This is related to the general increased oceanic heat transport across the Indo-Pacific Ocean, compensating for suppressed northward heat transport over the Atlantic. In addition, this altered interhemispheric temperature gradient leads to decreased (increased) precipitation in the NH (SH), particularly along the Gulf Stream in summer. Furthermore, the AMOC slowdown induces a southward shift of the ITCZ, substantially affecting precipitation in the tropical Atlantic and global monsoon regions. Homogeneous temperature responses under a weakened AMOC are intricately linked to sea ice responses via ice-albedo feedback in high latitudes and more related to atmospheric dynamics and changes in oceanic heat transport in mid-latitudes. However, we emphasize the importance of exploring the heterogeneous regional climate impacts of AMOC slowdown, a critical aspect often overlooked in research focused on global or European contexts ( 18 ,  45 ). We particularly highlight the heterogeneous effects of AMOC weakening on seasonal precipitation variations at a subcontinental scale, such as in North America. This heterogeneity underscores the complexity of changes across both land and ocean basins. We propose that the southward ITCZ shift and changes in surface turbulent heat fluxes are major mechanism behind disparate regional precipitation patterns. Changes in ITCZ location not only alter monsoon rainfall patterns but also affect atmospheric circulation shifts ( 71 ,  73 ) and global teleconnection patterns ( 2 ). Beyond the mean climate responses, temperature and precipitation extremes in northern mid-latitude regions exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, particularly in the persistence of extreme events. Our study uses a single climate model under pre-industrial conditions, complemented by a limited ensemble revealing robust patterns. While valuable, these insights should not serve as direct predictions of future climate scenarios. We recommend future investigations under enhanced climate warming conditions ( 3 ,  38 ) to better understand the unique responses of a weakening AMOC to greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols ( 5 ). We applied an idealized freshwater volume to induce AMOC weakening, acknowledging that different regions and durations of water-hosing could elicit varied regional climate responses. It remains uncertain whether consistent climate responses would be observed when equilibrium is reached following freshwater injection into different regions. Given the lack of agreement among experts regarding vulnerable regions to heightened freshwater influxes affecting AMOC ( 39 ,  74 ,  75 ), additional simulations using other climate models are imperative. The primary objective of our study is to establish a foundation and present one possibility for identifying the regional climatic responses of a weakened AMOC, emphasizing the importance of examining regions susceptible to inducing an AMOC slowdown. While large-scale climate responses to a weakened AMOC are generally consistent across models, a key limitation of our study is that homogeneous and heterogeneous climate responses at the subcontinental scale are highly model dependent, particularly with respect to hydrological changes. Factors such as atmospheric parameterization schemes, model resolution, and the sensitivity of deep-water formation regions to water-hosing are critical in assessing subcontinental climate responses ( 29 ,  48 ,  76 ,  77 ). Therefore, future research must engage a broader climate modeling community. Sensitivity analyses within the North Atlantic Hosing Model Intercomparison Project (NAHosMIP) project framework ( 23 ) could serve as a valuable next step in this effort. Overall, our findings provide critical perspectives on past, present, and future climate changes related to AMOC variations. We emphasize that different freshwater sources and injection regions can trigger substantial heterogeneous regional climate responses, particularly in the context of regional weather extremes. In light of these results, we advocate for expanded observational and modeling studies focused on the Irminger Basin ( 4 ), as this region may play a critical role in understanding the dynamic mechanisms and predicting the future strength of the AMOC."
155,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Global climate model In this study, the global climate model used is the new version of the AWI-CM3, a fully coupled model comprising the atmosphere and ocean ( 35 ). In particular, the atmosphere model (OpenIFS) is based on the global Integrated Forecasting System in version 43R3V1, developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). We conduct simulations at a resolution of Tco95 (∼100 km) with 91 vertical layers (TCo95L91). The ocean model used is the FESOM2, a global unstructured-mesh ocean model developed at AWI ( 78 ,  79 ). The unstructured mesh of FESOM2 contains around 127,000 surface nodes ( 80 ). It comprises 47 vertical layers, with horizontal resolution varying from 25 to 125 km. Refined resolution regions are set in high latitudes, the equator, and coastal areas. The sea ice component is embedded in FESOM2 and discretized and integrated on the same unstructured grid as the ocean model. The model components iterate via a concurrent coupling strategy that allows the exchange of surface heat, mass, and momentum fluxes between the atmospheric and oceanic components. The AWI-CM3 has been shown to perform better than the average of the CMIP6 models in representing global climatology ( 35 ). The stand-alone FESOM2 has been validated for its ability to simulate a realistic AMOC and has also demonstrated an improvement in the representation of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current ( 79 ). Sidorenko  et al.  ( 80 ) reported that the coupled FESOM2 and OpenIFS exhibits well performance in representing global-mean surface heat and freshwater budgets, as well as ocean hydrography. Therefore, the above evidence demonstrates the ability of the new climate model, AWI-CM3, to simulate the variability of AMOC and its far-reaching global influences. Experimental design To investigate the impact of a slowdown AMOC, we weaken the AMOC strength by artificially releasing freshwater into the North Atlantic region using a similar experimental design following previous studies ( 2 ,  18 ,  23 ). These freshwater perturbation experiments, commonly referred to as water-hosing experiments, are based on the pre-industrial control experiment. The PI-CTR experiment runs for 200 years, which is branched off from a 700-year-long spin-up, as shown in ( 35 ). External forcings, such as greenhouse gases and solar forcing, are fixed at the year 1850. To account for internal variability, a small three-member ensemble has been conducted. The other two members are initialized from 1 and 10 years off the first control run. This small ensemble approach helps reveal robust features by using different initial conditions. As for the water-hosing experiments, Jackson  et al.  ( 23 ) proposed an experimental framework, NAHosMIP, which designed water-hosing experiments by imposing additional freshwater input over the North Atlantic and along the coastal region around Greenland. This framework covers a border region supplied the freshwater fluxes to the ocean, while the sensitive regions responsible for changing AMOC are uncertain. The strength of the AMOC is sensitive not only to the regions where deep water formation take place but also to regions where there are changes in the net freshwater flux along the AMOC route ( 45 ). To explore the impact of water-hosing experiments in the North Atlantic, we define four distinct regions: the Irminger basin (HIM), Labrador Sea (HLB), Nordic seas (HNS), and North-East Atlantic (HNA). A detailed summary of these four regions can be found in table S1. We chose these regions based on a similar approach as in ( 34 ), where they assessed the local contributions to decadal AMOC variability. Although idealized, these regions have got much attention from both paleo- and modern observational perspectives, as they play major roles in driving subpolar AMOC variability ( 6 ,  10 ,  31 ,  33 ,  45 ,  49 ). Therefore, we designed our water-hosing experiment by inputting additional freshwater over these regions to reveal the sensitivity of climate responses to the location of freshwater forcing. The volume compensation is used to conserve global volume mean salinity ( 81 ). Furthermore, recent observational evidence suggests that the Irminger Sea plays a vital role in driving subpolar AMOC variability at multiple timescales ( 34 ,  36 ,  74 ); however, few climate models have supported these observations. Our sensitivity experiments can therefore offer insights into relating to the observations. Similar to the PI-CTR, we conduct three ensemble members for each regional water-hosing experiment to accentuate the signal and ensure robust responses. Each water-hosing experiment starts with the same initial climate state as the corresponding ensemble member from the PI-CTR experiments. The freshwater hosing strength remains consistently set at 0.1 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6  m 3  s −1 ) across the four defined regions, normalized to the covered oceanic grids. This ensures that the total freshwater flux is identical across all experiments. We note a caveat to this approach is the differing ocean areas, representing a compromise in our examination of the sensitivity of AMOC to hosing regions. In addition, although this hosing strength is idealized, it is considered a reasonable approach for reducing the AMOC strength ( 6 ,  23 ,  45 ,  82 ), and it represents a substantial estimate of potential freshwater input from melting glaciers in Greenland ( 22 ,  23 ). We introduce freshwater continuously at a rate of 0.1 Sv for the first 50 years (a total of 5 Sv over 50 years), followed by recovery experiments where no hosing is applied, allowing integration to continue for another 150 years. To mitigate numerical challenges, such as abrupt freshwater gradient changes, at the regional boundaries surrounding hosed regions, we generate the hosing field FWh for the water-hosing experiments. A hosing field, corresponding to a given hosing strength hSv, can be formulated as follows F _ lat ( x ) = cos ( kx ) ∣ x ∣ < L , k = π / 2 L 0 ∣ x ∣ > L (1) F _ lon ( y ) = exp ( − 0.01 * y 2 ) (2) FWh = hSv × F _ lat ( x ) × F _ lon ( y ) (3) where  L  represents the zonal range for each region, and in our study, hSv is set to 0.1 Sv. The lat and lon are the zonal and meridional boundaries of each region (table S1). The formulation of the hosing field is inspired by and adapted from Gill ( 83 ), where they investigated tropical circulation responses to an idealized heating field. In our approach, freshwater forcing is introduced with its maximum value at the center of the region and gradually diminishes toward the regional boundaries ( Fig. 2 ). Note that our hosing field is exclusively applied over the oceanic grids in AWI-CM3. Homogeneous and heterogeneous climate responses We use the latest reference regions defined by the IPCC AR6 to evaluate climate responses to a slowdown of the AMOC (text S3 and fig. S5). This reference framework, which encompasses 46 land and 12 ocean regions globally, provides a nuanced approach for analyzing regional climate changes ( 58 ). Within this framework, we assess homogeneous and heterogeneous climate responses across different water-hosing experiments on both subcontinental and seasonal scales. To assess the homogeneity and heterogeneity of a given climate response, we first calculate the ensemble-mean area-weighted mean of the relevant climatic variable for each specific reference region in both the control and water-hosing experiments. For each water-hosing experiment and each reference region, we then compute the differences relative to the control simulation over a defined period. If the sign of the change is consistent across all water-hosing experiments for a given region, then we define the response as homogeneous; conversely, if the sign of the change in one of the water-hosing experiments differs from the others, then we define the response as heterogeneous for that region. Extreme indices To explore the impacts of a slowdown of AMOC on extreme temperature and precipitation events, several extreme indices are computed according to the definitions from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices ( 84 ). All indices are calculated on an annual scale (model year): CSDI: Annual count of days when there are at least six consecutive days with daily minimum temperatures below the 10th percentile. The 10th percentile is calculated from the ensemble mean of the control simulation. CDD: Also known as dry spell index, this is the annual count of the largest number of consecutive days with daily precipitation amounts less than 1 mm. Heavy precipitation intensity (RX5day): The annual maximum value of consecutive 5-day precipitation amounts. In addition, changes in the hydrological cycle induced by a weakened AMOC are estimated by measuring the changed rate of annual freshwater flux between the atmosphere and the surface ( 67 ). This is determined by the annual total amount of precipitation minus evaporation (P-E)."

157,introduction,"INTRODUCTION The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the ocean, particularly the one associated with deep convection, plays a vital role in transporting heat from one hemisphere to the other ( 1 – 3 ). On present-day Earth, the global ocean is divided into two major ocean basins that are roughly zonally aligned: the Atlantic basin and the Indo-Pacific basin. Deep water forms in the northern North Atlantic and upwells in the Southern Ocean, giving rise to a strong clockwise Atlantic MOC (AMOC). In contrast, no deep water forms in the northern Indo-Pacific basin, so the Pacific MOC is shallow (<1000 m) and weak, contributing little to cross-equatorial heat transport ( 4 ). Even denser water than in either the Atlantic or Pacific, known as “bottom water,” forms around the Antarctic continent. However, the bottom water upwells over the Southern Ocean and, thus, has a very short upper branch and little effect on cross-equatorial heat transport. Consequently, most of the Pacific Ocean is filled with this bottom water and exhibits a weak counterclockwise circulation ( 5 ). Overall, the global MOC (GMOC) in the upper and middle ocean is dominated by AMOC ( 6 ,  7 ). The present-day GMOC leads to a net global oceanic heat transport of about 0.7 PW from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ( 1 – 3 ,  8 ). Numerical simulations have demonstrated that weakening of the AMOC can cause substantial NH cooling ( 9 ,  10 ) and has been proposed as a key mechanism for triggering millenial-scale abrupt climate events (Dansgaard-Oeschgar events) ( 11 ) or even glacial inception ( 12 ). Throughout Earth’s history, the GMOC has almost always existed, albeit with potential variations in direction and strength compared to the present-day AMOC. In addition, the cross-equatorial heat transport associated with the GMOC has been shown to have considerable influence on the latitudinal location of the intertropical convergence zone ( 13 – 15 ). Therefore, understanding the factors controlling the direction and strength of the GMOC is crucial for both the present and the past. Numerous studies have extensively explored the factors that affect the AMOC. These investigations have revealed that various factors, such as greenhouse gases ( 16 – 18 ), aerosols and dust ( 19 ,  20 ), freshwater ( 9 ,  21 – 24 ), orbital configuration ( 25 ), ice sheets ( 11 ,  26 ,  27 ), rising of mountains ( 28 – 30 ), and opening or closing of straits ( 31 – 35 ) could affect the AMOC substantially. In many cases, these factors affect AMOC by modifying the surface ocean density through changing precipitation ( 6 ,  18 ,  28 ), ocean salinity transport ( 32 ,  36 ,  37 ), meltwater from either sea ice ( 38 ,  39 ) or land ice ( 11 ,  22 ,  27 ), etc. In others, shifts in the AMOC have been attributed to the change of westerly winds over the Southern Ocean ( 4 ,  31 ,  40 ,  41 ). Many theoretical and idealized works have also explored how the MOC’s strength depends on the vertical diffusivity ( 42 ,  43 ), the westerly wind stress ( 31 ,  40 ,  43 ,  44 ), and the density contrast between the two polar regions ( 43 ,  45 ). Nevertheless, changes in the AMOC’s controlling factors considered in previous studies are relatively minor compared to the wide range of changes that did occur throughout Earth’s history. Two important ones, which have not yet been considered, are the evolution of continental configuration and dramatic changes in climate. Here, we show that the strength of GMOC is fundamentally controlled by continental configuration over geological timescales based on two series of snapshot model simulations of the Paleozoic with evolutionary topographic boundary condition ( 46 ). In the first series of simulations (group I), we varied the external forcings (atmospheric CO 2  concentration and solar constant) to ensure that the simulated climate is consistent with the climate reconstruction by Scotese ( 47 ); in the other (group II), the external forcings were fixed so that the climate changed little (see Materials and Methods for more details). The Paleozoic began 541 Ma (million years) ago with the breakup of the Pannotia supercontinent and ended 252 Ma ago with the formation of the Pangaea supercontinent. Most of the continents were located in the SH during the early Paleozoic and gradually drifted northward (fig. S1) ( 48 ,  49 ). Throughout this era, the climate swung dramatically between hot houses and ice houses, with the global mean surface temperature (GMST) fluctuating between 10° and 26°C ( 47 ,  50 ). The Paleozoic provides a unique opportunity to study the controlling factors for the GMOC because (i) the direction of GMOC was stable over time, allowing us to focus on the change of strength, and (ii) the large climate fluctuations allow us to test how surface climate itself affects GMOC strength. In addition to the controlling factors considered in previous work ( 18 ,  19 ,  21 ,  25 ,  51 ), the realistic Paleozoic continental configuration used here allows us to identify a previously unknown factor that has important influence on GMOC strength but has never been considered before. Besides the traditional wisdom that high-latitude processes determine the strength of the GMOC, we find that low-latitude open seaways can also have a sizable influence on the strength of the GMOC. The discovery of this factor enriches our understanding of the driving mechanisms behind the GMOC and expands current theories on MOC strength."
158,results,"RESULTS The direction of Paleozoic GMOC GMOCs in group I are characterized by a single counterclockwise circulation ( Fig. 1 ). The counterclockwise Paleozoic GMOC is primarily due to the fact that the circumpolar current is in the NH rather than SH (figs. S1 to S3), unlike that on modern Earth. A secondary contributing factor is that the maximum potential density (referenced to 2500 dbar; i.e., σ 2.5 ) of the polar water in the SH is larger than that in the NH in all periods except at 390 Ma (fig. S4). The higher NH polar density at 390 Ma does not change the direction of GMOC but just strengthens the clockwise bottom circulation, extending it further southward ( Fig. 1 ). This bottom circulation has negligible contribution to cross-equatorial heat transport, similar to its present-day counterpart, and is thus not the focus of the current study. The GMOC’s direction during the Paleozoic in group II is the same as that in group I (fig. S5), indicating its stability against climate changes. The direction of the GMOC obtained here is also consistent with simulations using the models cGENIE by Pohl  et al.  ( 52 ) [the Extended Data, figure 3A of ( 52 )] and HadCM3L by Valdes  et al.  ( 53 ) (figs. S6 and S7), except that the latter starts to exhibit a clockwise GMOC near the end of Paleozoic. Many other studies that focused on only a certain period of the Paleozoic also obtained the same GMOC direction as we do here ( 54 – 59 ). Fig. 1. The stream functions of group I. The GMOC is shown as stream functions (1 Sv = 10 6  m 3 /s). Time increases left to right and top to bottom; 540 Ma is in the top left, and the PI is in the bottom right. Previous work emphasized the role of polar density, as the modern AMOC can collapse if the water density of the North Atlantic becomes too small ( 23 ,  24 ). In extreme cases, previous work found that the direction of GMOC could even reverse ( 9 ,  23 ,  60 ). Therefore, a relatively high polar density in the SH during the Paleozoic is crucial for efficient deep-water formation in the SH and a counterclockwise GMOC. This higher SH density is maintained by the higher surface salinity there (fig. S8), which itself is mainly due to the much less net precipitation over oceans in the southern SH (south of 30°S) than in the northern NH (north of 30°N;  Fig. 2A ). Note that the river runoff in the SH exceeds that in the NH (the dashed curves in  Fig. 2B  and fig. S9), decreasing the surface salinity near the coastal regions (fig. S8). However, because of the wideness of the ocean, high-salinity water can persist in the high-latitude SH (fig. S8). At present day, the northern North Atlantic Ocean is narrow, so its salinity is easily perturbed by freshwater input from melting of either Arctic sea ice ( 38 ,  39 ) or continental ice ( 11 ,  22 ,  27 ). Fig. 2. Time series of the freshwater input into the mid- to high-latitude (30° ~ 90°) ocean. Red curve, Southern Hemisphere; blue curve, Northern Hemisphere. ( A ) The net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation). ( B ) Four forms of freshwater: precipitation (solid), evaporation (solid and dotted), runoff (dashed), and meltwater from sea ice (dotted). GMOC strength primarily varies because of midlatitude continents The strength of simulated GMOCs (see Materials and Methods) in group I varies greatly during the Paleozoic ( Figs. 1  and  3 ). Specifically, the GMOC index is around 20 Sv at the beginning of the Paleozoic, increases to a maximum of 32 Sv at 450 Ma, decreases to a minimum of 6 Sv at 290 Ma, and then increases again by 10 Sv toward the end of the Paleozoic (red solid curve in  Fig. 3A ). In comparison, the modern AMOC has a strength of ~15 Sv at the equator ( 1 ,  6 ). Strikingly, the strengths of the GMOC in both group I and group II remain remarkably consistent across all time periods (red curves in  Fig. 3A ) despite substantial differences in the GMST between the two groups (black curves in  Fig. 3A ). This indicates that the climate evolution plays a minor role in the evolution of GMOC. In other words, the evolution of continents controls the evolution of GMOC during the Paleozoic. This motivates us to investigate the relevant physical processes that drive GMOC evolution. Fig. 3. Evolution of the GMOC and related analyses. The correlation of GMOC (red) with GMST (black) ( A ), the difference of maximal potential density (referenced to 2500 dbar) between the SH and NH (σ 2.5  Diff, gray) ( B ), the zonal westerly wind stress averaged between 30°N and 60°N (Tau_W, blue) ( C ), and the Ekman pumping flux etween 40°N and 70°N (Ekman pumping, purple) ( D ). The bottom two panels are the correlations of Tau_W with GMST ( E ) and the land volume between 30°N and 60°N (land volume, brown) ( F ). Solid curves are for group I, and dashed curves are for group II. The correlation indexes above each panel are for group I and group II, respectively. The MOC strength has been shown to be positively correlated with the density difference between the two polar regions ( 43 ,  45 ), the wind stress in the upwelling region ( 40 ,  43 ), and the ocean’s vertical diffusivity ( 41 – 43 ). Since vertical diffusivity is set to be the same in all simulations, this factor is not considered here. The difference in the maximum density of polar waters is not correlated with the variation of GMOC in either group of experiments ( Fig. 3B ). Therefore, the only process left is the wind stress, the curl of which drives upwelling via Ekman pumping. Although the upwelling is driven by the wind stress curl, the midlatitude wind stress is normally used in theoretical studies (the two are equivalent in idealized experimental configurations). Accordingly, we directly compare the wind stress to the GMOC. We find a high Pearson correlation coefficient between the GMOC indexes and the zonal westerly wind stress averaged between 30°N and 60°N (Tau_W) ( Fig. 3C ), with a value close to 0.85 for both groups of simulations. This relationship remains robust regardless of the specific region chosen for wind stress averaging. This high linear correlation between GMOC strength and wind stress is consistent with the theoretical prediction by Nikurashin and Vallis ( 43 ) under weak–vertical diffusivity limit. As shown in Nikurashin and Vallis ( 43 ), under weak–vertical diffusivity limit, the MOC is predominantly wind driven and relatively insensitive to changes in vertical diffusivity or bipolar density contrast. The present-day AMOC is also roughly in this limit ( 40 ,  41 ). Unlike the present-day narrow northern North Atlantic, the Paleozoic ocean was wide even at high latitudes (fig. S8), making it very difficult to shut off the deep-water formation there. Sensitivity tests show that a large freshwater forcing of 1.7 Sv in the southern SH ocean weakens the GMOC at 460 Ma by 65%, and 3.4 Sv are needed to shut it off almost completely (not shown). In comparison, in many models, 0.1 Sv of freshwater forcing over the northern North Atlantic is sufficient to strongly perturb surface density and shut down the present-day AMOC ( 23 ,  24 ,  61 ,  62 ). Note that there is a spurious correlation (0.70) between GMOC indexes and GMST for group II (dashed curves in  Fig. 3A ). This correlation exists because continental evolution (fig. S1B) simultaneously drives long-term cooling of global climate ( 63 ) and a weakening of GMOC. The climate cooling is decoupled from the change of Tau_W in our simulations; a positive correlation (0.69) between Tau_W and GMST ( Fig. 3E ) is contrary to the general understanding that a colder climate induces a larger midlatitude meridional temperature gradient and thus stronger westerly winds ( 64 ). Climate change does have some minor influence on the GMOC. This influence is best seen by looking at a specific time slice. For example, at 450 or 440 Ma, the GMST in group I is much lower than in group II, and Tau_W is correspondingly stronger ( Fig. 3E ). This stronger Tau_W drives a slightly stronger GMOC ( Fig. 3A ). However, a similar relationship cannot be found for another cold period from 320 to 290 Ma, suggesting a complex interaction between GMOC and climate. Rather than depending on global climate, Tau_W is found to be highly influenced by the continental configuration, more specifically, the land volume in the midlatitude region ( Fig. 3F ). Only when the midlatitude land volume is stable that Tau_W shows a good relationship with either meridional temperature gradient (fig. S11) or GMST ( Fig. 3E ). The surface topography blocks winds by form drag and slows down winds by increasing surface friction. Therefore, the more the land volume, the slower the westerly winds, decreasing Tau_W ( 64 ,  65 ). Previous studies focused on the impact of the opening and depth of Drake Passage on the formation of a strong AMOC ( 31 ,  33 ,  35 ) but overlooked the importance of gradually evolving continental topography. Our results show that the midlatitude land volume is better correlated with Tau_W and the strength of the GMOC than the land area ( Fig. 3F  and fig. S12). The midlatitude meridional temperature gradient, hence, Tau_W has been suggested also to be influenced by the aspect ratio of ocean basin, but the relationship is not good for the hemisphere that has a zonally open channel ( 66 ). Thus, the evolution of aspect ratio of ocean basin and its influence on Tau_W are not investigated in the current study. Importance of low-latitude continental configuration on GMOC strength There is an obvious mismatch between total midlatitude Ekman upwelling and the GMOC indexes from 420 to 350 Ma; GMOC during this period is much stronger than would be expected from wind-driven upwelling (shaded area in  Fig. 3, C and D ). This mismatch suggests that factors beyond Tau_W are at play. In addition, the subtropical cell (STC) circulation in the NH is abnormally strong and deep during this period ( Fig. 1  and fig. S5). We speculate that such abnormal behavior of both GMOC and STC is due to the near absence of land in the NH low latitudes (figs. S1A and S13B). Because of the lack of land, the NH experiences a much stronger westward zonal ocean current compared to the SH at low latitudes ( Fig. 4A  and figs. S2 and S13C). This intensified westward flow is accompanied by a stronger northward Coriolis force, contributing to higher sea surface heights (SSH) over the corresponding NH region than that in the SH ( Fig. 4B  and figs. S13D and S14). An SSH gradient forms across the equator, and a pressure gradient is generated in the upper ocean (noticeable even at 500-m depth;  Fig. 4C ). Such pressure gradient drives a southward mass transport across the equator in the upper ocean, which must return via the lower ocean, enhancing GMOC. We confirm this expectation with the idealized experiments carried out using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) in which a shallow low-latitude seaway is opened in one of the hemispheres (see Materials and Methods; figs. S15 and S16). Fig. 4. Evolution of hemispheric contrasts of various factors in low-latitude region and the result of binary linear regression. The hemispheric contrasts are all calculated by the NH minus SH ( A  to  C ). The correlation of ocean surface zonal velocity (UVEL) contrast between equator and 30° latitude (black; it is weighted by Coriolis force parameters) with land area contrast between equator and 30° latitude (brown) (A), the SSH contrast between 10° and 30° latitude (blue) with UVEL contrast (B), the pressure contrast in the 500-m ocean depth between equator and 30° latitude (gray), and SSH contrast (C). ( D ) The result of binary linear regression of GMOC (red) using Ekman pumping between 40°N and 70°N and SSH contrast (purple). Solid curves are for group I, and dashed curves are for group II. The correlation indexes above each panel are for group I and group II, respectively. When the Ekman upwelling (integrated over 40°N and 70°N) and the difference in low-latitude SSH (between 10° and 30° latitude) between NH and SH are combined linearly to construct the GMOC strength, it reproduces the model-simulated GMOC ( Fig. 4D ) much better than that constructed by using the upwelling alone ( Fig. 3C ). Therefore, we propose that the strength of GMOC is influenced not only by continental configuration within the westerlies region but also by that over the low-latitude region."
159,discussion,"DISCUSSION On the basis of a series of simulations for the Paleozoic, we find that the GMOC is primarily controlled by freshwater input into ocean, wind-driven Ekman pumping in the midlatitudes, and the SSH anomaly in low latitudes ( Fig. 5 ). The latter two factors are especially important for the strength of the GMOC and are highly related to continental configuration. Our major conclusions find validation through Paleozoic climate simulations using the HadCM3 model by Valdes  et al.  ( 53 ,  67 ) and a non-IPCC class model, FOAM, by Pohl  et al.  ( 52 ) (figs. S17 and S18). This last study by Pohl  et al.  ( 52 ) also pointed out the unfortunate absence of proxy data for validating the direction and magnitude of the Paleozoic GMOC. Fig. 5. Schematic of controlling factors for the GMOC during the Paleozoic. The schematic is based on the situation for 400 Ma. Three main factors are shown, the less net precipitation in the south SH; the strong westerlies, ocean surface current, and Ekman upwelling in the midlatitude region in NH; the SSH anomaly and associated pressure anomaly in the low-latitude region. Although there has been tremendous interest in understanding the mechanisms that govern the MOC, surface topography in the westerlies region and the presence of an open seaway in the low-latitude region were previously largely overlooked. Our study thus draws attention to how the evolution of continents in these two regions affects the strength of MOC. Our study indicates that the traditional theory for MOC misses an important element, that is, the influence of a low-latitude seaway. Previous studies either did not have such a seaway ( 1 ,  34 ,  43 ) or had a partial seaway that connected the present-day Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean only ( 32 – 34 ). Their focus was mostly on the strength of the AMOC and mechanism invoked generally involved freshwater and salinity only ( 32 ,  33 ,  68 ), while as demonstrated above, a fully open low-latitude seaway affects the MOC in a fundamentally different way. Exploring how the width, depth, and latitudinal location of a low-latitude seaway affect the MOC will require detailed investigations in both theoretical and realistic experimental studies in the future. The conclusions obtained in this study cannot be simply applied to the more recent era, such as the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. During most periods of the Mesozoic, the wide midlatitude zonal ocean channels were absent in both hemispheres; since the late Mesozoic, the world ocean began to split into a wide Pacific and a narrow Atlantic Ocean. Because of these differences in continental configuration, GMOCs during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic were presumably controlled by distinctly different mechanisms, analysis of which is underway."
160,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Numerical model and simulations Here, we use a fully coupled version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM 1.2.2) ( 69 ) to simulate the climate during the Paleozoic. The atmosphere and land share the same horizontal grid, which has a resolution of ~3.75° × 3.75°. The ocean and sea ice also share the same grid, which has a uniform spacing of 3.6° in the zonal direction. In the meridional direction, the grid spacing is ~0.6° near the equator and poles and 3.4° near the midlatitude. In the vertical, the atmosphere and ocean have 26 and 60 layers, respectively. The simulated GMOC in pre-industrial (PI) is consistent with that obtained by tracer inversion ( 70 ), reanalysis data ( 6 ), and other climate models ( 71 ). The ocean bottom is set as a flat basin with the depth about 3500 m during the Paleozoic. This configuration is based on paleo-digital elevation model ( 48 ) and is similar to that in other Paleozoic climate simulations ( 53 ). The model configuration is the same as that in Li  et al.  (2022) and more detailed descriptions can be found there ( 46 ,  72 ). Continental ice sheets are not considered in the simulations presented here, but sensitivity tests are done for 440 and 290 Ma, for which the ice sheets are obtained by an offline simulation using the ice-sheet model ISSM ( 73 ). The results show that GMOC changes by only ~1 Sv in both cases (fig. S19). The results from two groups of simulations are analyzed here. Group I is carried out by Li  et al.  (2022) from 540 to 250 Ma with a 10-Ma interval. In this group, the solar constant varies according to the solar model ( 74 ), and the atmospheric CO 2  concentration is tuned to ensure that the simulated GMST can match the reconstructed ones ( 47 ). Group II is forced by fixed CO 2  concentration [2800 parts per million (ppm)] and solar constant (1360.89 W/m 2 ). In this group, only the continental configuration changes among experiments so as to distinguish the influence of climate evolution and continental evolution on GMOC. The results of group II have not been presented anywhere before. Besides, we also run a PI case, and the CO 2  concentration and solar constant are set as 280 ppm and 1360.89 W/m 2 . All simulations are continued for longer than 2000 model years, with some of them over 5000 model years. The time series of globally mean temperature at the surface and 2649 m ocean, as well as the GMOC index, during the last 1000 years of all simulations are shown in figs. S20 to S23. The linear trends of temperature during the last 500 years are all smaller than 0.8°C/1000 years, and the trends of GMOC are generally smaller than 1.5 Sv/1000 years. Simulations with such small trends are normally considered to have reached equilibrium ( 53 ). Definition of GMOC and GMOC strength The GMOC is represented by the so-called baroclinic stream function, which is defined as the zonally integrated meridional transport ( 1 ) ψ ( y , z ) = ∫ z η ∫ x w x e vdxdz (1) where  v  is the residual meridional velocity, that is, the sum of Eulerian mean and eddy-induced velocity, and η is the surface height. For GMOC,  x w  and  x e  cover the whole longitudinal range. The strength of GMOC (GMOC index) is defined as the largest absolute value of the global ocean meridional stream function below 500 m at the equator. This definition is somewhat different from some previous definitions ( 75 – 77 ), for we think this index is more indicative of cross-equatorial mass transport than the maximum value at the mid or high latitude. The evolutions of GMOC indexes in these two definitions are consistent (fig. S24). The Ekman pumping driven by wind stress The Ekman pumping (in dimension of velocity) that is crucial for MOC is calculated as Ekman pumping = ∇ × ( τ f ρ ) (2) where τ is the wind stress,  f  is the Coriolis parameter, and ρ is the seawater density. The upwelling in  Fig. 3D  is the total Ekman pumping flux between 40°N and 70°N. The setup of idealized experiments using MITgcm The idealized experiments are carried out using the MITgcm ( 78 ), in a hydrostatic Boussinesq configuration. We use an ocean-only model with 2° × 2° horizontal resolution and 29 layers vertically. The domain’s latitude is from 70°S to 70°N and only 70° of longitude. The zonal wind stress is fixed (fig. S15C), and the meridional wind stress is removed. To remove the effect of temperature and salinity, the surface temperature is hemispherical symmetrical (fig. S15D), and the ocean salinity is globally uniform. A deep channel (3000 m) is opened between 48°N and 70°N. Two cases are conducted, and the low-latitude channel is closed in ideal_ctl case (fig. S15A), while there is a shallow channel (330 m) between 10°N and 30°N in ideal_330m case (fig. S15B)."

162,introduction,"Introduction The onset and intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) occurred from the mid-Pliocene to the early Pleistocene (ca. 3.6–2.5 Myr ago), and represented a major climatic transition within the broader, gradual Neogene cooling 1 , 2 . Proposed mechanisms responsible for the onset and intensification of NHG (hereafter referred to as “oNHG” and “iNHG”, respectively) have mainly focused on factors such as decreasing atmospheric CO 2 3 , 4 , polar ocean stratification 5 , and tectonic changes affecting the configuration of major oceanic gateways including the Bering Strait, the Indonesian seaway, and Central American seaway 6 . Although teleconnections between the terrestrial and marine components of the Earth System can critically affect global climate 7 , their potential impacts during the oNHG at ~3.6 million years ago and iNHG at ~2.7 million years ago have received less attention 2 . To elucidate the role of land-ocean teleconnections, we investigate marine dust records that contain clues about environmental conditions of the dust source regions as well as the intensity/position of transporting agents (such as wind, water, and ice) 8 – 11 . Pelagic North Pacific Ocean sediments provide a unique archive for reconstructing windblown dust delivered from the arid interior of Central and East Asia and the associated Northern Hemisphere westerlies (Fig.  1 ). Previous studies in the North Pacific have focused either on the driving mechanisms for enhanced aeolian dust production 8 , 12  or the characteristics of wind systems transporting dust 12 , 13 . These studies show that, in addition to the moisture budget in dust source regions of Central and East Asia, the latitudinal position and strength of prevailing westerly winds might also have influenced the temporal variability of aeolian dust fluxes to the North Pacific Ocean 13 . Furthermore, several high-resolution studies previously revealed that dust deposition in the North Pacific increased between ca. 2.74 and 2.72 Myr ago, coeval with the establishment of large-scale perennial Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheets (NHIS) 13 , 14  (Fig.  2a ). As previously noted 13 , the timing for mid-latitude North Pacific dust flux enhancement is concomitant with the first substantial rise in dust fluxes into the North Atlantic 15  (Fig.  2i ) and the Southern Ocean 16  (Fig.  2j ), indicating a tight interhemispheric connection between enhanced global dust inputs and global cooling during the late Pliocene. While previous studies have suggested that variations in the position and intensity of the westerlies were governed by similar mechanisms for times before the iNHG 13 , 14 , the connection between pre-iNHG dust fluxes to the North Pacific Ocean and the underlying mechanisms triggering the oNHG remain uncertain. This uncertainty persists because of the scarcity of continuous, well-dated North Pacific dust records with sub-orbital resolution for the period before ca. 3 Myr ago 13 , 14 .

Here we fill this critical gap by providing high-resolution rock magnetic and geochemical records for Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1208 (Fig.  1 ). ODP Site 1208 is well positioned to constrain Asian dust inputs and sedimentation in the North Pacific during the middle and late Pliocene (4.0−2.5 Myr ago) 17 . Combined with available stable isotope stratigraphy (ca. 3.7−1.7 Myr ago) 18  and extra-terrestrial  3 He-derived sediment fluxes (ca. 4.5−2.5 Myr ago) 13 , our data indicate increased aeolian dust input to the North Pacific during periods when NHIS formed and expanded throughout the Pliocene. We propose that the vegetation turnover in Central Asia and dust inputs to the Pacific in the mid-Pliocene could promote a link between ice-sheet formation, land-surface albedo, and ocean-atmosphere coupling. We also present climate simulations to support the notion that the waxing and waning of NHIS representing cold and warm intervals, respectively, during the middle-Pliocene and early Pleistocene can substantially alter the characteristics of the westerlies, and thus dust transport into the North Pacific Ocean."
163,results,"Results and discussion Plio-Pleistocene dust evolution in the North Pacific Ocean Elemental (La-Th-Sc) and radiogenic Pb isotope data, along with previously published Nd and Sr isotope data 19  show that detrital fractions of sediments at ODP Site 1208 are sourced from Asian dust and circum-Pacific volcanic detritus 20 , with the Taklimakan Desert as the dominant source of dust 19  (Supplementary Fig.  1a–c ). Dust from Central and East Asia contains abundant haematite (Hm) and goethite (Gt) 21 , and acts as the primary control on the overall Hm and Gt signals in depositional settings where aeolian dust constitutes the majority of the terrestrial input 22 . We thus use the flux of Hm and Gt (Rel Hm+Gt  flux) at ODP Site 1208 as a proxy for Asian dust inputs to the North Pacific (see Material and Methods), with higher fluxes reflecting enhanced atmospheric dust inputs into the ocean. Our Rel Hm+Gt  flux record reflects the timing and nature of North Pacific dust flux variability during the middle to late Pliocene, with a sufficient temporal resolution to resolve sub-orbital changes over 4.0–2.5 Myr ago (Fig.  2c, d ). The baseline of Rel Hm+Gt  flux minima remains remarkably invariant from 4.0–2.5 Myr ago, with increased fluxes associated mostly with cold (glacial) periods (Fig.  2a ). Of note, our data reveal noteworthy variations across three major glacial periods. Firstly, an initial enhancement of aeolian inputs observed at both western (ODP Site 1208) and central North Pacific (ODP Site 885) at ca. 3.6 Myr ago (Fig.  2b ), accompanied by a shift in the vegetation of Central Asia (Fig.  3d ). These coeval changes corresponded to an ice-rafted detritus (IRD) peak in the Arctic Ocean at the oNHG 23  (Fig.  3c ). Considering the previously proposed connection between late Pliocene ice sheet extent and dust fluxes to the ocean 13 , our data are consistent with the notion that initial variations in NHIS volume can be traced back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) Gi2 (Fig.  2a ), when the NHIS was relatively small in spatial extent and short in duration 24 , 25 . Secondly, dust flux greatly increased from ca. 3.31 to 3.28 Myr ago (glacial MIS M2), which was a globally pronounced cooling event that disturbed the climate of the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period (mPWP, ca. 3.3−3.0 Myr ago) 26 , 27 . The interval following the mPWP was characterized by larger fluctuations in dust fluxes, including pronounced dust peaks during pre-iNHG glacial intervals (MIS KM2 and G20). Thirdly, the iNHG is marked by a prominent dust peak at 2.73 Myr ago (Fig.  2c and d ), after which dust inputs during glacial maxima seem to have varied proportionally to the global ice volume, as reflected by benthic oxygen isotopes 28  (Fig.  2a ). Pleistocene ice volume were largely driven by changes in the Laurentide Ice Sheet 29 , 30 .

Initial dust intensification linked to Northern Hemisphere cooling in the mid-Pliocene Previous studies have suggested that both land-ocean connections and atmospheric circulation may have played key roles in both the oNHG 31  and iNHG 7 . Combined with terrestrial vegetation and atmospheric circulation records from the Northern Hemisphere, our dust record from ODP Site 1208 (Fig.  3e and f ) reveals two temporally distinct modes of mechanisms responsible for cooling over the Pliocene: Mode 1 (3.6–3.3 Ma) and Mode 2 (3.3–2.5 Ma) (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Mode 1 (3.6–3.3 Ma) is characterized by variations in Earth-surface dynamics in Central Asia that are connected to shifts in other components of the climate system farther afield (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). Initially, during the oNHG from ca. 3.6–3.5 Myr ago, there was a reduction of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and thus AMOC as indicated by surface-water cooling (ca. 3.5 °C) and freshening in the North Atlantic Ocean (Supplementary Fig.  3b, c ). The AMOC reduction might have been driven by increased inflow of low-salinity Pacific waters through the Bering Strait into the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans 32 . This is evidenced by the growth of large alpine glaciers from ca. 3.6 Myr ago, which produced increasing influxes of Alaska Range detritus and glacial meltwater to the Bering Sea 33 . A mechanistic link between the opening of the Bering Strait and NHG has been suggested for the late Pliocene to explain a reduction in AMOC 34 , 35 . However, the Bering Strait likely opened much earlier. Recent geological and biogeographic evidence indicates that the Bering Strait was already persistently open around 5.5 Myr ago 36 . If the opening of this gateway is connected to the strength of AMOC, then together these findings imply that Bering Strait was open for a protracted period during which the sill was deep enough to allow the arrival of Pacific mollusc faunas into the Atlantic Ocean as early as 5.5 Ma, but not enough to substantially alter Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean surface water properties. Here, we hypothesize that the deepening of Bering Strait below the required threshold was the westward tectonic extrusion of the Bering Block in response to a reactivation of the subduction of the Pacific plate below the Alaska-Aleutian arc 36 . The likely appearance of mountain glaciers in Alaska by the time of MIS M2 at ca. 3.3 Myr ago 3 , 4  is consistent with enhanced uplift of the central Alaska Range in response to accelerated Pacific plate subduction, extrusion of the Bering block, and deepening of the strait by the mid-Pliocene 36 , 37 . Coupled with broadly simultaneous tectonic uplift and enhancement of IRD deposition in the Fram Strait area 23  (Fig.  3c ), this suggests that tectonic events, surface uplift and the subsequent inception of mountain glaciers preconditioned the peri-Arctic region to stimulate AMOC weakening already by ca. 3.6 Myr ago. Comparing modelling results based on an open and closed Bering Strait under Pliocene boundary conditions 34 , we further demonstrate that a weaker AMOC, driven by the persistent inflow of relatively fresh Pacific waters through an open Bering Strait, could reduce northward heat transport in the North Atlantic and lead to a steepening of the meridional temperature gradient in the Northern Hemisphere (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Such a steepened gradient in an open Bering scenario would strengthen the mid-latitude jet stream and westerly winds in the mid to lower troposphere (200–850 hPa) (Fig.  4 ), facilitating the transport of Asian dust into the North Pacific. Similar effects on the meridional temperature gradient in the North Pacific Ocean and the westerlies have been modelled to be related to narrowing of the Indonesian seaway 38 . These proposed connections provide a mechanism linking enhanced transport of dust from Asia to the North Pacific Ocean with the oNHG. Furthermore, vegetation and precipitation records from Central Asian dust sources suggest a change towards conditions that are more conducive for chemical weathering during the mid-Pliocene 7 , 39 , leading to enhanced erosion and sediment production. Changes in vegetation and precipitation are consistent with our chemical weathering indicators and elevated dust fluxes in the western and central North Pacific Ocean 8 , 10  (Fig.  1 ), which together can be interpreted to reflect increased dust emissions from Central Asia around 3.55 Myr ago. Overall, we propose that enhanced dust input for Mode 1 was driven by increased dust production at the source region and intensified mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, both of which ultimately stem from the export of low-salinity waters from the Bering Sea to the Arctic and then North Atlantic Oceans around 3.6 Myr ago.

The white star indicates the location of ODP Site 1208. Anomalies indicate the differences between open and closed BS conditions (i.e., open BS climate minus closed BS climate). Enhanced Northern Hemisphere westerlies during major Pliocene glaciations Our proposed Mode 2 corresponds to changes in the relative influence of the westerlies and the Siberian High that impacted Asian dust emissions, transport, and deposition 40  (Supplementary Fig.  2b ). During the middle (ca. 3.4−3.3 Myr ago) and late Pliocene (ca. 2.9 and post 2.7 Myr ago), cool and arid conditions were widespread across central Eurasia as recorded in sediments from Lake Baikal 41 , Arctic Siberia 42  (Fig.  3g ), and the Tarim Basin 43 . Sea surface temperatures at ODP Site 1208 cooled by 2–4 °C in the western mid-latitude North Pacific during glacial periods of the mid to late Pliocene (i.e., glacial MIS M2 and post-iNHG) 13  (Fig.  3b ). This mid-latitude cooling, in conjunction with relatively small changes in tropical SSTs, could reflect an increase in the meridional temperature gradient, resulting in the migration and intensification of Northern Hemisphere westerly winds 12 , 13 . Modern observations of dust activity indicate that several factors influence dust emissions, including surface wind speed, gustiness, vegetation cover, and soil wetness 44 . To assess the potential of changing dust flux during mid and late Pliocene glaciations, we further analysed modelling results representing the climate of the mPWP, MIS M2 and iNHG (see Methods). In the three scenarios, the extent of NHIS differs substantially between glacial and interglacial periods. During the cold intervals of the mPWP, the Northern Hemisphere continental ice was restricted to Greenland (Fig.  5a ). We note, however, that continental ice may have covered the mountainous regions of Alaska and northern Scandinavia during glacial M2 6 , 7  (Fig.  5b ). The growth of Alaskan alpine glaciers during glacial M2 is supported by increasing fluxes of detritus from the Alaska Range at Site U1341 in the Bering Sea (Fig.  3h ), possibly due to seasonal glacial meltwater 45 . The major growth of the NHIS occurred during the iNHG (ca. 2.7 Myr ago) 31  and is represented by the LGM NHIS scenario in our model simulations. We note that this is probably an overestimation of Northern Hemisphere ice volume (Fig.  5c ), but it may represent a possible scenario for the extent of the Laurentide ice-sheet as reported previously 46 . We chose this extreme scenario to investigate the sensitivity of the atmospheric circulation to changes in ice sheet extent under Pliocene boundary conditions. Compared to the warmer mPWP, the two glacial scenarios considered (glacial M2 and post-iNHG glacials) experienced a decrease in both summer precipitation and evaporation over East, South, and Central Asia. However, the simulations show that the reduction in evaporation caused by cooling exceeded the reduction in precipitation, driving a slightly positive change in the soil moisture budget (precipitation minus evaporation) over inland Asia, which may have helped maintain soil moisture during glacial periods (Supplementary Fig.  5 ), and further increased weathering and could favour the formation of fine-grained dust to some extent 8 . Fig. 5 Modelled ice sheet and zonal wind changes under three climate conditions. The shaded colour in ( a – c ) indicates the land ice fraction. Average zonal winds at different pressure levels ( d – f ) are calculated for longitudes between 120°E and 150°E, corresponding to the dominant dust source region for the North Pacific. The orange, blue, and purple curves represent PlioMIP1, MIS M2, and iNHG simulations, respectively. The 850 hPa, 500 hPa and 200 hPa pressure levels generally correspond to altitudes of ~1.5 km, ~5.5 km and, ~12 km, respectively, but can vary due to air conditions and geographic locations. MIS, Marine Isotope Stage; NHG, Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Aside from just increased dust formation, the characteristics of winds driving dust tranport are also different between our simulations. Specifically, our model results suggest that changes in mid-latitude wind circulation play an additional role in enhanced dust flux at our core site. With the build-up of a more extensive NHIS, zonal winds increased at 850 and 500 hPa levels (Fig.  5d–f ). The average zonal wind along 120°E–150°E became stronger throughout the year during glacial M2 and following the iNHG, with wind strength being even stronger during the latter (Fig.  5d, e ; Supplementary Fig.  6 ). Modern studies show that the strength of the westerlies is related to the meridional temperature gradient 47 . Relatively stronger westerly winds during glacial M2 and the iNHG in the lower and middle atmospheric layers are associated with an increased meridional temperature gradient (Supplementary Fig.  7a, b ). However, this is not the case in the upper troposphere. The meridional temperature gradient during glacial M2 is stronger than that during iNHG, but the latter experienced stronger westerly wind speeds (Supplementary Fig.  7c ). Notably, modelling of the dust cycle has shown that the main transport of dust occurs below the middle troposphere (3−6 km 48 ). As such, the westerly winds in the upper troposphere do not contribute significantly to the total dust transport in the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast to long-range dust transport in the Southern Hemisphere 49 . Therefore, we suggest that the westerly winds in the lower to middle troposphere promoted dust transport from the interior of Asia to the North Pacific when a larger NHIS formed in the mid-Pliocene (MIS M2) and post-iNHG. Implications for future climate change Our North Pacific dust flux record and modelling results aid in better characterizing large-scale Northern Hemisphere Pliocene glaciation events and their associated impacts. In particular, our work (1) provides evidence for long-term Northern Hemisphere ocean-atmosphere-land interactions associated with the oNHG and iNHG, (2) points to enhanced dust production during the intense Pliocene glacial interval M2 that is likely linked to shifts in atmospheric circulation, and (3) supports existing evidence that the iNHG was associated with increased meridional temperature gradients and a strengthening of the westerlies 13 – 15 . Although the controls on Northern Hemisphere westerlies are determined by stepwise glacial expansion, the response of Earth’s surface dynamics to Plio-Pleistocene climatic change in continental landscape likely generated terrestrial feedbacks affecting atmospheric circulation. We propose that this redistribution of global water vapour linked to North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere feedback was coupled with the reorganization of vegetation patterns in Central Asia 7 , 39  (Fig.  3d ). There is also evidence that East and Central Asia experienced multiple steps of C 4  vegetation expansion through the Pliocene, depending on local monsoon rainfall 50 . Collectively, this significant regional vegetation expansion was common at least in Northwest Australia 51 , and the Indian subcontinent 52 , 53  (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). At the oNHG, the major dust pulse (Fig.  3e  and Supplementary Fig.  8d ) was intrinsically linked to regional vegetation change (Supplementary Fig.  8 ), thus showing the coupling between ice-sheet growth (Supplementary Fig.  8a ), land-surface and ocean-atmosphere systems. Moreover, the increased inland weathering and C 4  expansion would have induced additional feedbacks related to the carbon cycle 54  (Supplementary Fig.  3e ). With respect to anthropogenic warming, the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere shows a larger magnitude of warming than at lower latitudes because of the polar amplification, while at the same time a proposed slowdown of the AMOC is expected to result from North Atlantic cooling and freshening 55 . Based on our Pliocene data and modelling, these changes will likely cause counteracting impacts on the mid-latitude westerlies, which has important implications for future climate conditions across the Northern Hemisphere. A comprehensive understanding of these processes regarding large-scale climate system feedbacks, atmospheric circulation, and dust production is necessary to better represent these components of the climate system in climate models to provide improved projections of future climate change."

166,introduction,"Introduction Permafrost is a fundamental component of Arctic and high-elevation landscapes, covering ~13 to 18% of the Northern Hemisphere’s land surface 1 . The top three meters of permafrost are estimated to contain 1035 ± 150 petagrams (Pg) of soil-organic carbon, which is twice the amount currently stored in the Earth’s atmosphere 2 , 3 . Polar and high-elevation regions have warmed faster than other areas over recent decades 2 , increasing the risk of further permafrost degradation. This thawing can lead to the release of carbon dioxide and methane from decomposing organic matter that was previously frozen 3  and creates positive feedback loops that further accelerate and amplify climate warming 4 , 5 . Glacial terminations (also known as deglaciations) are episodes of global climatic warming associated with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) along with δ 13 CO 2  decrease 6 – 8 . The upwelling of poorly ventilated and carbon-rich abyssal Southern Ocean water masses are thought to be the primary source of deglacial CO 2  rise 9 – 11  as well as a  14 C-depleted source of atmospheric radiocarbon (Δ 14 C; ref.  12 ). Nonetheless, millennial-scale ventilation of Southern Ocean water masses cannot fully explain the centennial deglacial CO 2  and synchronous methane (CH 4 ) increases, and alone cannot account for the full magnitude of the observed decline in atmospheric δ 13 CO 2  and Δ 14 C (refs.  4 , 5 ). Recent evidence suggests that destabilization of permafrost carbon reservoirs could have played an important role in the last deglacial CO 2  rise 4 , 5 , 13 – 16 . However, identifying the permafrost source areas and establishing the timing of long-isolated terrestrial carbon releases during the deglaciation remains challenging. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), with an average elevation exceeding 4000 m, is the principal area of permafrost in the low latitudes and represents the largest high-altitude permafrost region on Earth, containing a globally significant stock of approximately 160 petagrams (Pg) of soil-organic carbon 17 , 18 . One modeling study suggests that alpine permafrost and its associated carbon pool might be of comparable importance to that of the circum-Arctic region in determining the global permafrost-climate feedback 19 . However, the absence of detailed alpine permafrost thawing history limits our ability to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics, as well as the governing mechanisms of terrestrial cryosphere carbon remobilization in response to climate change. Here, we provide the orbital-scale Tibetan alpine permafrost degradation history using dated periods of local speleothem growth. We find that Tibetan Plateau permafrost primarily thawed during deglacial Terminal stadials, periods associated with a near shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as manifested in millennial-scale reductions in Asian monsoon intensity (i.e., weak monsoon intervals; WMI). This contrasts with the remaining circumarctic permafrost, which typically begins thawing at the onset of interglacial periods/end of deglaciations. Given the link between permafrost thawing and the release of ancient terrestrial carbon, our data suggest that the TP permafrost could be an important contributor to the rise in atmospheric CO₂ during deglaciations. Speleothems are carbonate deposits that form in karstic terrains (typically limestone and dolomite) when rainwater percolates via the soil dissolving bedrock and organic carbon. In regions where the upper vadose zone remains frozen year-round, water infiltration is halted, inhibiting the dissolution of soil-organic carbon due to reduced or absent plant activity. This, in turn, results in a cessation of speleothem growth in the underlying cave. As such, we would not expect to find speleothems in permafrost regions where the soil has remained frozen for extended periods of time. Surprisingly, ancient speleothems can be found in current permafrost zones suggesting that the overlying area may have experienced periods of thawing due to the deepening of the active layer during past warmer climates 20 – 22 . By reconstructing speleothem growth periods from Siberian 20 , 21  and Canadian caves 22 , 23  located in the circumarctic permafrost region, previous studies have assessed the vulnerability of circumarctic permafrost during warm interglacial periods 20 – 23 . In this study, we compiled 169 uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates from previous research to reconstruct the growth history of 30 speleothems from the Tianmen cave system (30°55′N, 90°4′E, ~4800 m a.s.l.) located within the discontinuous permafrost zone of the central Tibetan Plateau (Fig.  1A ). In combination with circumarctic speleothem data, this constitutes a global-scale permafrost thawing history covering the last five glacial-interglacial cycles in the past 500,000 years (Fig.  1B  and Supplementary Fig.  1 ). Importantly, most of the caves in these two regions are currently in the southern marginal zone of continuous permafrost and therefore sensitive to permafrost degradation in response to glacial-interglacial climate warming. This enables us to investigate the long-term tempo-spatial evolution of permafrost and the driving mechanisms, especially during terminations (Fig.  2  and Supplementary Fig.  2 ).

167,results,"Results and discussion Permafrost processes on the Tibetan Plateau The study area on the Tibetan Plateau is characterized by a monsoonal climate with annual precipitation of about 440 mm. Around 81% of the annual rainfall precipitates in summer 24 . The mean January and July air temperatures are −12 °C and 9 °C, respectively, with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of about −0.9 °C based on data (1955–2020) from the nearby Nagqu meteorological station (31.48°N, 92.07°E, 4508 m a.s.l). The modern cave temperature is ~1 °C, which is ~3.7 °C higher than MAAT, assuming a lapse rate of 0.6 °C per 100 m, and the relative humidity inside the cave is ~93% (measured in August 2007) 24 . Speleothem growth in permafrost regions largely depends on a steady drip of water into the cave, which is controlled by the soil’s percolation rate associated with the depth of the permafrost active layer. Rainfall and meltwater from ground ice, the main sources of drip water 25 , can seep into the cave through the overlying soil layers only when the active layer deepens due to permafrost thawing. This facilitates speleothem formation. Here, we utilize previously published U-Th dating data of speleothem calcite from active growth periods, and pair it with δ 18 O on the same samples to identify whether TP speleothems grew during strong or weak monsoon periods across 5 terminations during the last 500 ka. We then used kernel density estimation (KDE) 26 – 28  to generate probability distributions of both our compiled ages for TP 24 , 29 , 30  and published circumarctic speleothems ages from Siberia and Canada 20 – 23  to reconstruct active speleothem growth periods over the past ~500 kyr (Fig.  1g–i ). Our findings indicate that speleothem growth in the Tianmen cave typically begins during Weak Monsoon Intervals associated with a collapsed AMOC state during climate terminations 31  (Fig.  2  and Supplementary Figs.  2 ,  3 ). These periods are characterized by drier conditions compared to interglacial climates 32 . This suggests that the overlying permafrost conditions, which influence both meltwater availability and soil percolation rates, may be the primary drivers of speleothem growth during terminations, rather than meteoric water, the modern source of drip water to the cave. Vulnerable Tibetan Plateau permafrost during past interglacials The growth history of TP speleothems during the past five interglacials closely resembles that of speleothems in the circumarctic permafrost region during these periods (Fig.  1B ). Specifically, all KDE peaks and overlapping shoulders correspond consistently to typical warm interglacial periods (i.e., Marine isotope stages (MIS) 1, 5, 7, 9, 11;), indicating recurring permafrost thawing when global climate reaches a warm interglacial state, associated with high global sea-surface temperatures and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Furthermore, TP speleothems grew during interglacial sub-stages, i.e., MIS 5a, 5c, MIS 7c, 7e, and MIS 9a, while Siberian and Canadian speleothems do not show significant growth in these relatively moderate warming periods (Fig.  1B ). This may be due to the higher MAAT on the Tibetan Plateau (−4.7 ± 4.4 °C) compared to the circum-Arctic regions (−12.4 ± 6.4 °C) resulting in a deeper active layer in the TP region 33 . This suggests that TP permafrost may be yet more vulnerable to warming climates than circumarctic permafrost, even though the latter is likely influenced by polar amplification of global warming 33  during sub-interglacial stages. During the warm MIS 5, we observe that TP speleothem growth stagnates during cold interglacial sub-stages (i.e., MIS 5b, 5d) and during glacial inception and glaciation. These periods are characterized by local cooling associated with decreased greenhouse gas concentrations, reduced local summer insolation, and the expansion of continental ice sheets (Fig.  1B ). It is likely that speleothem growth stopped due to the development of permafrost linked to regional climatic changes that inhibited water percolating into the cave. Moreover, the growth generally ends at the interglacial strong monsoon periods (Supplementary Fig.  3 ), minimizing the influence of rainfall-induced drainage water on speleothem growth. The discontinuities in the Holocene (MIS 1) speleothem growth for the TP may be a response to interglacial temperature fluctuations that altered the permafrost condition, and the thickness of the active layer, overlaying the specific stalagmites. For example, growth likely halted during the cooling period that followed the Holocene Climatic Optimum, and regrew during the Medieval Warm Period (Supplementary Fig.  2 ). This resulted in localized speleothem growth patterns within the cave, with some stalagmites growing and others remaining dormant. As an example, while the TP permafrost thawed continuously during the warm MIS 5e interglacial, individual speleothems only grew during specific periods within this stage 24 . Due to the limited number of stalagmite samples collected from the Holocene, it is possible that other speleothems in the region may have grown throughout this period but were not sampled. Nevertheless, the two existing samples support the conclusion that Tibetan Plateau stalagmites did not begin to grow until the onset of the Holocene. Onset of Tibetan permafrost thawing during deglacial Terminal stadials The U-Th chronology underpinning the speleothem growth phases constrains the initial date of continuous permafrost thawing (Methods) during the past five glacial-interglacial cycles. During terminations (T)-II and T-III, the onset of circumarctic permafrost thawing is confined to interglacial periods, and lags TP permafrost thawing (Fig.  2 ). During T-IV, Siberian speleothems exhibit an unusual growth phase preceding MIS 9e. This is identified through four ages from four individual speleothems, and is better characterized as a “growth event” rather than a phase of continuous growth. The cause of this glacial growth event is undetermined. Glacial low biogenic silica content in nearby Lake Baikal suggests it is unlikely to have been driven by climate warming (Supplementary Fig.  4 ). Consequently, this glacial growth event may not be directly linked to continuous permafrost thawing suggesting that the thawing of TP permafrost likely preceded that of the circumarctic region. Given the complexity of thawing mechanisms and the scarcity of regional temperature records, further research is necessary to fully understand the causes of this early growth event. During T-V, the large dating uncertainties in circumarctic samples make it challenging to establish the lead-lag relationship between TP and circumarctic permafrost thawing. Nevertheless, when considering the dates with relatively lower age uncertainties as the onset of continuous speleothem growth (Methods), it is possible that Tibetan Plateau permafrost thawing may still have preceded that of the circumarctic region. Overall, despite the complexities in the timing of circumarctic permafrost thawing, the onset of Tibetan Plateau permafrost thawing generally occurs within dating uncertainties during deglaciations, prior to the continuous thawing of circumarctic permafrost during warm interglacial periods/end of the deglaciation (except for T-I) (Fig.  2  and Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Notably, the onset of TP permafrost thawing coinciding with the WMI and the collapse of the AMOC 31 , 34  appears to be a common feature. This is supported by higher δ¹⁸O carbonate  values in both the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) composite speleothem record 31  and Tianmen cave records which serve as proxies for the Southern Asian summer monsoon (SASM) 24  (Fig.  2  and Supplementary Fig.  3 ). The δ 18 O values of speleothems in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) domain are primarily controlled by summer monsoon intensity which is driven by large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation accompanied by changes in rainfall amount, temperature, seasonality, as well as moisture source and trajectories (ref.  24  and references therein). It has been suggested that changes in ASM circulation manifest as millennial-scale positive δ 18 O speleothem anomalies, are a consequence of AMOC slow down during Terminal stadials 31 , 34 . This correlation further indicates that Tibetan permafrost thawing and deglacial AMOC reductions are likely in close association, independent of the absolute speleothem dates. Moreover, the δ 18 O carbonate  record of a central European Cave 35  and δ 13 C carbonate  record from a cave fronting the North Atlantic 36  provide good constraints on the timing of AMOC disruption and the last warming stage of the T-II (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). By comparing our onset dates of continuous growth with these absolute dated record from the high-latitude regions, we find that TP permafrost thawing occurred during AMOC collapse of T-II, while the circumarctic permafrost thawed during the following warm interglacial period (MIS 5e). This well-constrained termination corroborates AMOC-induced TP permafrost thawing inferred from ASM δ 18 O records. While the chronology of marine records is less precise than that of absolutely dated speleothems, various lines of marine evidence consistently demonstrate that glacial terminations are characterized by a sequence of prominent climatic events. These include increased iceberg rafting (Fig.  2g ) and depleted benthic foraminifera δ 13 C values in the North Atlantic (Fig.  2f ), indicating a shallower or weaker AMOC at the onset of the termination 37 , which precedes the main phase of deglaciation as manifested in benthic δ 18 O records (Fig.  2 ). This has been widely interpreted as early deglacial freshwater input disrupting AMOC 37 . These “Heinrich Events” are well reflected in absolutely dated ASM speleothem records and support the link between continuous TP permafrost thawing and early deglacial AMOC disruptions. Furthermore, the initial growth rate of Tibetan Plateau speleothems was generally higher at the onset of deglaciations compared to subsequent interglacial periods (Supplementary Fig.  6 ), which cannot be explained by the drier climate during terminations. Instead, this high growth rate suggests abrupt thawing of ground ice and increased percolation rate, rather than direct atmospheric precipitation supply, as the primary controls for speleothem growth. Additionally, permafrost thawing can enhance the respiration of previously frozen soil carbon as evidenced by the decreased δ¹³C values of stalagmite at the onset of thawing 38  (Supplementary Fig.  6 ). The release of this freeze-locked carbon can elevate  p CO₂ levels in the soil potentially leading to higher Ca²⁺ concentrations in drip waters and stimulating faster speleothem growth 38 . It is also noteworthy that the last deglaciation was an exception. Unlike the circumarctic permafrost, which thaws in the middle of the deglaciation, Tibetan Plateau permafrost did not thaw until the early Holocene (Fig.  2 ). This suggests that increasing GHGs and summer insolation during termination are not the dominant factors controlling TP permafrost thawing. Instead, we attribute this exception to the early recovery of the AMOC during Bølling-Allerød, coupled with an active AMOC during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), which effectively reduces TP warming during HS1 and postpones the onset of TP permafrost thawing during T-I. Given the varying characteristics of the past five terminations, we acknowledge the complex relationship of the TP permafrost thawing with changes in summer insolation, ice volume, and GHGs. For example, the onset of continuous thawing does not align with changes in local summer insolation during deglaciations, since TP permafrost thawing occurs during both high (T-II and T-III) or low (T-IV and T-V) rates and magnitudes of summer insolation increase (Fig.  2b ). Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between permafrost thawing and GHG levels. During T-II and T-V, speleothem growth begins during the final stages of deglacial CO₂ rise, while during T-III and T-IV, speleothem growth commences during the initial stages (Fig.  2c ). This aligns with the thawing dynamics of TP permafrost, which can occur across a wide range of ice volumes and CO₂ levels (Fig.  2a, c ). Consequently, the lead-lag relationships between the Tibetan Plateau and circumarctic permafrost thawing may vary among different terminations. To clarify these differences, more precisely dated speleothems from permafrost regions covering T-IV and earlier periods are needed. Dynamics of boreal permafrost thawing during deglaciations The AMOC plays a fundamental role in hemispheric heat distribution by regulating meridional heat transport (Supplementary Fig.  7 ). This regulation is driven by changes in the formation and export of North Atlantic Deep Water 37 , 39 . Multiple climate models suggest that a collapsed AMOC could lead to warming in northern India and the TP 40 – 43 , although the underlying mechanism remains to be discussed. The warming pattern contrasts with the cooling observed in other regions at similar latitudes to the Tibetan Plateau and northern India, such as the Mediterranean region 44  (Fig.  3 ). This suggests that the warming in these regions cannot be solely attributed to meridional heat redistribution caused by the AMOC collapse. A comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting the surface heat balance in the TP region is necessary to understand the underlying dynamics driving its warming. Here we use a climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM) to quantify the contributions of different physical and dynamical processes (Fig.  3 ). Fig. 3 Processes contributing to Tibetan Plateau warming in boreal summer. a – h  Decomposition of  a  surface temperature difference between the North Atlantic hosing experiment (GFWF) and the equilibrated glacial control simulation (GCTL) into seven individual processes due to  b  surface albedo,  c  water vapor,  d  cloud,  e  surface sensible heat flux,  f  surface latent heat flux,  g  atmospheric heat transport, and  h  surface dynamics (i.e., land and oceanic surface energy transport). The Tibetan Plateau caves and the Siberian Caves are marked by red stars and blue circles, respectively. (Map produced by NCL Version 6.6.2, 10.5065/D6WD3XH5) 87 . Our analysis suggests that a collapsed AMOC could shift the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) southward due to meridional heat redistribution 45  leading to a weakening of the ASM (Fig.  2e ). This, in turn, could reduce moisture transport from the ocean resulting in decreased cloud cover and precipitation in northern India and the Tibetan Plateau. Studies have shown that the abundance of mixed-phase clouds in summer can have a significant cooling effect on the TP 46 . Reduced cloud cover can lead to increased downward shortwave radiation resulting in a positive cloud radiative effect at the surface (Fig.  3d ). Consequently, reduced rainfall can dry the ground, reducing soil moisture and associated surface evaporation (latent heat flux) and further contributing to warming (Fig.  3f ). Moreover, the reduced soil heat capacity of drier ground can also contribute to surface warming (Fig.  3h ). Collectively, a collapsed AMOC could significantly contribute to both summer and annual warming on the TP (Fig.  3a  and Supplementary Fig.  8 ) through local cloud—precipitation—soil moisture feedbacks. Using a permafrost heat diffusion model (Methods), we confirm that the AMOC-induced TP warming during Terminal stadials can effectively deepen the permafrost active layer by promoting its thawing (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). As a result, associated meltwater as well as precipitation would penetrate through the cave causing speleothem growth. With the collapse of the AMOC, northward heat transport was significantly reduced, leading to a pronounced cooling in the northern high latitudes (Fig.  3 ). This initial cooling was evident in the North Atlantic and accompanied by sea-ice expansion which subsequently influenced the North American and Eurasian continents through the ice-albedo feedback 47 . These changes effectively offset the effects of rising CO₂ and summer insolation on local surface temperatures delaying circumarctic permafrost thawing until the onset of interglacials/end of deglaciations. At this time, the AMOC recovers to its active mode coinciding with high CO₂ levels and low ice volumes/extents. This period is characterized by a generally ameliorated northern high-latitude climate (Fig.  2d ). A notable finding is that Tibetan Plateau permafrost did not thaw until the Holocene, while circumarctic permafrost experienced an earlier thawing during the last deglaciation (Fig.  2 ). This is consistent with previous circumarctic permafrost studies of marine sediments 15 , 16  and model simulations 4 , 5  suggesting remobilization and release of circumarctic permafrost carbon during the last deglaciation. Compared to previous terminations, the Bølling-Allerød event during T-I (ref.  48 ) effectively mitigated the warming effect of TP due to the rapid recovery of the AMOC during the middle stage of the deglaciation. In contrast, this abrupt AMOC recovery triggered the thawing of circumarctic permafrost. The onset of TP permafrost thawing generally occurred during the middle or end of the WMI during T-II to T-V (Fig.  2 ). This suggests that the brief early disruption of the AMOC during HS1 was unable to deepen the active layer and initiate speleothem growth due to insufficient heat accumulation. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence suggesting that the AMOC remained relatively active during HS1 (refs.  49 – 51 ) and the Younger Dryas 52 , despite being weaker than its state during the Last Glacial Maximum 50 , 53 . We, therefore, suggest that the weaker but still active AMOC during HS1 cannot give rise to robust warming and hence delay the TP permafrost thawing during T-I. Despite the lack of comparative studies on the AMOC activity during different terminations, it has been demonstrated that a weakened AMOC can produce anomalous warming in the Indo-Pacific ocean 54 , 55  (Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Records suggest that Indian Ocean Sea-surface temperature (SST) warming relative to the North Atlantic was less pronounced during T-I compared to T-II (Supplementary Fig.  11 ). This may suggest that the AMOC was more active during T-I than T-II. Additionally, carbon isotope ratios of benthic foraminifera in the North Atlantic (ODP Site 983) likely suggest a stronger AMOC during T-I compared to the previous four terminations (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). These observations strengthen the critical role of AMOC changes in determining the onset of permafrost thawing during deglaciations. Therefore, the observed phase difference in the timing of permafrost thawing between the circumarctic and TP regions can be explained by changes in the strength of the AMOC that exerts opposing thermal effects in the two regions (Fig.  4 ). Fig. 4 Conceptual diagram showing the relationship between Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variations and permafrost thawing during glacial-interglacial cycles. a  Frozen permafrost in Northern Hemisphere during the cold glacial period with low greenhouse gases (GHGs).  b  The deglacial collapse of the AMOC reduces polar energy transport, leading to cooling in the circumarctic region. Concurrent reductions in South Asian summer monsoon induce Tibetan Plateau (TP) warming through local cloud–precipitation–soil moisture feedback. This, along with rising greenhouse gas levels, contributes to TP permafrost thawing.  c  The recovery of AMOC during interglacial periods enhances polar energy transport and, in conjunction with elevated GHGs, contributes to warming in high-latitude regions and the thawing of circumarctic permafrost. There is no TP permafrost thawing events are observed in our records during MIS 3, despite repeatedly occurring Heinrich events. This might be related to the shorter duration of these events and the more stable, cold glacial climate background compared to terminations (Supplementary Fig.  10 ), which effectively reduces the AMOC-induced TP warming that leads to permafrost thawing. The lower temperature during MIS 3 may have resulted in colder underlying soil and bedrock, making the region less susceptible to AMOC-induced warming in the TP. Further research using permafrost proxies from other regions of the Tibetan Plateau is essential for understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as the underlying dynamics, of permafrost changes of the TP across glacial-interglacial cycles. Our findings suggest that permafrost thawing is a common occurrence during the past five deglaciations. Tibetan alpine permafrost thawing occurred during the Terminal stadials, which preceded the circumarctic permafrost thawing in most terminations. This stands in contrast to the circumarctic regions where permafrost thawing is evident at the end of the deglaciations. Modeling results further reveal that the asynchronous thawing between the Tibetan Plateau and circumarctic permafrost is controlled by the magnitude of millennial-scale climate variability during deglaciations. The last deglaciation appears unusual in comparison to other terminations, due to the advanced thawing of the Tibetan Plateau permafrost and delayed response in the circumarctic regions. Conclusions, therefore, need to be made separately for T-I and the other Termination events. Nonetheless, thawing permafrost, irrespective of location, always presents a carbon source for deglacial atmospheric CO 2  rise and, therefore, has the potential to close the glacial-interglacial cycle carbon budget when considered in addition to the marine carbon pool 4 , 5 , 15 . In addition, our findings might shed light on mechanisms of centennial-scale CO 2  pulses during deglaciations and warm interglacials 56 , 57 . Current Earth System Models 3  tend to parameterize climate-permafrost-carbon feedbacks. It may be beneficial to include them in future model set-ups to advance our understanding of how permafrost carbon may have driven and will drive past, current, and future climate variability."

170,materials|methods,"Materials and Methods Isotope Enabled Parallel Ocean Program 2 (iPOP2). Parallel Ocean Program (POP2) ( 45 ) is the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The ocean model configuration is nominal 3° horizontal resolution and 60 vertical layers, with 10 m resolution in the upper 200 m, expanding to 250 m resolution below 3,000 m. POP2 adopts hydrostatic approximation and the convection in POP2 is treated as enhanced vertical mixing. When vertical density profile indicates convection, large diffusivity and viscosity are applied ( 46 ). Modified K-profile Parameterization (KPP) ( 47 ) is used for vertical mixing and diffusivity is approximately 0.1 × 10 −4  m 2 /s near the surface and increasing to 1 × 10 −4  m 2 /s to the depth ( 48 ). The simulated modern deep convection sites using POP2 broadly agrees with modern observations ( 45 ). For direct model-data comparison, isotope-enabled POP2 (iPOP2) is developed with the implementation of the several most commonly used isotope tracers: carbon isotopes ( 49 ),  231 Pa/ 230 Th ( 50 ),  δ 
 18 O ( 51 ), and neodymium isotopes ( 52 ). To illustrate the role of different NADW source regions, dye tracers are implemented in the model. A dye tracer is released with 0 surface value except in the source region where its surface value is specified at 1. In the interior ocean, dye tracers are transported as other passive tracers. Two dye tracers are released, one from the GIN Seas (including the Irminger Sea and Iceland basin) and the other from the subpolar Atlantic Ocean, including the Labrador Sea ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A ). PD Simulations. The ocean model iPOP2 is coupled to data models of atmosphere, sea ice, land, and river from the normal year forcing in CORE-II dataset ( 53 ) for the PD simulation. The temperature is forced by the surface heat flux calculated from the observed atmospheric variables and model SST via the bulk formula, while salinity is forced on the surface by the observed precipitation minus evaporation flux with an additional weak salinity restoring of 4-y time scale. The experiment uses realistic topography ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 B ). The PD experiment is initialized from a 7,000-y spin up and integrated for another 1,600 y. The average of the last 100 y is used as PD in this study. The maximum AMOC transport is 15.6 Sv ( Fig. 1 A ), with the deep convection occurring mainly in GIN Seas, Irminger Sea, and Iceland Basin ( Fig. 1 B ), consistent with observations ( 37 ,  54 ). The barotropic streamfunction shows a standard double-gyre structure of subtropical and subpolar gyres over the North Atlantic with a tilted intergyre boundary along ~45°N ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). The vertical NADW extent is overall consistent with observations, as indicated in the model-data comparison of water mass proxies such as  δ 13 C  ( 49 ) and  ε Nd  ( 52 ). To illustrate the wind effect on EP at PD, the Experiment PD_nowind is presented. The model set-up for PD_nowind is the same as PD, except that the surface wind over 15°N to 90°N in the North Atlantic is suppressed to 0.01 of the original value. This experiment is run for 1,000 y and the average of the last 10 y in this simulation is used for analysis. LGM Experiments. We present five experiments under the LGM condition using ocean-alone iPOP2. All five experiments are forced by monthly surface forcings (heat flux, freshwater flux, and momentum flux) from a coupled model LGM simulation (TRACE21K) ( 55 ), with a 30-d restoring to monthly surface salinity in TRACE21K and 10-d restoring to monthly surface temperature in TRACE21K. Details of this forcing method are described in references ( 51 ,  56 ). (1) Experiment LGM is taken from a transient ocean simulation of the past 22,000 y with active biogeochemical cycles and multiple isotopes (C-iTRACE) ( 56 ). The bottom topography uses the PD topography after lowering the sea level by 120 m ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 E ). The average from 19.1 ka to 19.0 ka in C-iTRACE is analyzed as LGM in this study. TRACE21K applies the land ice sheet reconstruction by ICE-5G ( 57 ). Therefore, the impact of elevated continental ice sheet (e.g., the Laurentide Ice Sheet) on atmospheric circulation is considered in the model. However, the katabatic winds associated with the Laurentide Ice Sheet might be poorly resolved due to coarse resolution ( 58 ) and worth detailed studies in high-resolution models in the future. The barotropic streamfunction shows an intensified double-gyre with the intergyre boundary shifted from ~ 45°N at PD southward to ~40 o N ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 C ). The AMOC maximum streamfunction is 17.6 Sv ( Fig. 1 E ), which is slightly stronger than PD and the AMOC depth is significantly shallower than the PD. Previous theoretical studies suggest that the AMOC strength is correlated with AMOC depth following the scaling law:  T NA ∼ Δ ρ H 2 f n , where  T NA  is the AMOC strength, H is AMOC depth,  f n  is the Coriolis parameter at the latitude where NADW forms, and  Δ ρ  is the meridional density gradient or the shared density range between circumpolar channel and the isopycnal outcrop region in the North Atlantic ( 59 ,  60 ). However, the direct application of this scaling law to the deglacial AMOC change is complicated by the choice of  Δ ρ  ( 61 ). A full understanding of the relationship between the depth and strength of the AMOC during the last deglaciation remains to be studied in the future. (2) Experiment LGM_nowind is the same as experiment LGM but with suppressed wind forcing over the North Atlantic. The experiment is initiated from 22 ka in C-iTRACE and integrated for 1,000 y, forced by the 22 ka to 21 ka surface forcings in TRACE21K in the same way as C-iTRACE, except that the surface wind stress is reduced to 0.01 of the original values over 15°N to 90°N in the North Atlantic, including the Labrador Sea. The average of the last 10 y in this simulation is used for analysis. The AMOC streamfunction remains similar to LGM ( Fig. 1 I ), with a maximum transport of 20.1 Sv. In the barotropic streamfunction, the subtropical gyre disappears, but the subpolar gyre remains modestly strong ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 D ) because of the bottom topography and JEBAR effect ( 35 ). One thing to note is that the wind effect discussed in this study is in the context of ocean alone model with the surface buoyancy forcing fixed and the surface buoyancy feedback by the wind is therefore not considered, which is different from the wind effect in coupled climate models ( 62 ) ( SI Appendix, Text ). (3) Experiment LGM_nowind_FB is the same as LGM_nowind but with a flat bottom set at the depth of 5,375 m uniformly north of 15°N in the North Atlantic ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 G ). The experiment is integrated for 1,000 y and the average of the last 10 y in this simulation is used for analysis. The AMOC streamfunction remains similar to LGM, with a maximum transport of 19.8 Sv ( Fig. 1 M ). Now, both subtropical and subpolar gyres vanish in the barotropic streamfunction ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 F ), as expected from the Sverdrup relation. (4) Experiment LGM_weak is the decadal average of the 17.5 ka state in C-iTRACE. Since the freshwater forcing is gradually added in C-iTRACE, ramping from 3 m/kyr to 5 m/kyr from 18.4 ka to 17.5 ka, the model can be treated as in quasi-equilibrium. In LGM_weak, the simulated AMOC transport is 9.9 Sv, which is about half of the AMOC transport at LGM, while the geometry of AMOC in LGM_weak is similar to LGM ( 5 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 ). The surface condition is also similar to LGM as the open-ocean convection spanning the western half of the subpolar North Atlantic still presents ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5  B  and  C ). Therefore, LGM_weak is a sensitivity test for the GNAIW pathway with a different AMOC strength. (5) Experiment LGM_NA&SO_nowind is the same as experiment LGM_nowind but with additional suppressed wind forcing over the Southern Ocean. The surface wind stress is set to 0.01 of the original values over both North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. The experiment is initiated from LGM_nowind and integrated for 1,000 y. The average of the last 10 y in this simulation is used for analysis. The AMOC transport is reduced to 13.1 Sv, much weaker than LGM and LGM_nowind, which confirms that the wind stress over the Southern Ocean acts as the “pulling” effect that drives the adiabatic circulation of AMOC ( 59 ,  63 ,  64 ). However, albeit weaker, the EP stays in the similar location as in LGM and LGM_nowind because the open ocean convection still presents due to the fixed surface buoyancy forcing ( SI Appendix , Fig. S13 ). PD and LGM Ocean Simulations with 1-degree Resolution. To verify the results from 3° simulations, a set of 1° simulations are carried out under PD and LGM condition. The 1° simulations share the same model set-up as the 3° simulations, except for the model resolution. The PD is forced by CORE-II dataset ( 53 ) and the LGM is forced by monthly surface forcings from TRACE21K simulation ( 55 ). The simulated mid-depth NADW pathways at the intergyre boundary under PD condition have been compared with the 0.1° high-resolution simulation ( 65 ), which reveals that unlike the 3° simulations in which the NADW is excessively transported in the EP, some of the NADW is also transported in the interior pathway west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, in better agreement with the 0.1° high-resolution simulation ( 17 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). The simulated North Atlantic deep convection regions and the EP features in the 1° simulations are all similar to the 3° simulations under both PD ( 17 ) and LGM condition ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). Previous studies suggest that low-resolution models tend to simulate excessive open ocean convections, especially around the Antarctica ( 66 ). There is also a possibility that the open ocean convection in the glacial North Atlantic simulated in the 3°, and even the 1°, simulations might be biased. Here, under PD condition, the deep convection regions in the North Atlantic overall agrees with the very high-resolution eddy-resolving (0.1°) simulation ( 65 ). This agreement gives some credential to our model simulations for the North Atlantic. In addition to the reasonable model performance for the present day, the simulated regions of deep convections in the LGM subpolar North Atlantic agrees with the glacial winter surface density reconstruction. Therefore, the open ocean convection in the LGM subpolar North Atlantic might be a robust feature of the LGM ocean state. Nevertheless, it is certainly desirable in the future to perform the simulations to explore the open ocean convection and its associated rim currents in more advanced models with higher resolution and, even better, without the hydrostatic approximation that is adopted in the current generation of CESM. Observational and Model  231 Pa/ 230 Th. 231 Pa/ 230 Th is a kinematic proxy for ocean transport. Both  231 Pa and  230 Th are produced at relatively uniform rates in the ocean with a production ratio of 0.093, and the isotopes are subject to ocean transport and particle scavenging ( 67 ). The different scavenging efficiency of the two isotopes leads to different residence times between  231 Pa and  230 Th: approximately 50 to 200 y for  231 Pa and 10 to 40 y for  230 Th ( 42 ,  67 ). In the North Atlantic, the longer residence time of  231 Pa allows a greater amount of the isotope to be exported southward by deep ocean currents, resulting in widespread observations of modern-day sediment  231 Pa/ 230 Th below the production ratio (~0.093) at depth. Based on the principle above, a positive shift in the deep North Atlantic downcore sediment  231 Pa/ 230 Th is often interpreted as weaker ocean transport and vice versa ( 39 ). However, in addition to ocean transport, sediment  231 Pa/ 230 Th can also be influenced by particle flux and composition ( 68 ). Following the criteria set by a previous compilation of available North Atlantic  231 Pa/ 230 Th sediment core observations ( 6 ), sediment records that were considered to have a dominant influence by particle fluxes were not included in the model-observation comparison in this study ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ). 231 Pa/ 230 Th in iPOP2 is implemented in two versions: p-coupled and p-fixed ( 50 ). In p-coupled  231 Pa/ 230 Th, the particle fluxes associated with reversible scavenging are simultaneously calculated from the biogeochemical model. In p-fixed  231 Pa/ 230 Th, the particle fluxes are fixed at the PD values produced by the biogeochemical model in iPOP2. In this study, the  P -fixed version of  231 Pa/ 230 Th is used, and the  231 Pa/ 230 Th change in the model is only associated with circulation change. The simulated PD  231 Pa/ 230 Th is in agreement with core-top observations ( 50 ), and the simulated LGM  231 Pa/ 230 Th captures the broad feature of LGM Atlantic  231 Pa/ 230 Th observations ( 5 ). The presence of some discrepancies between observed and modeled  231 Pa/ 230 Th ( Fig. 3 B ) is probably due to a combination of the coarse model resolution, sediment chronology uncertainty, and additional oceanic processes influencing  231 Pa/ 230 Th that are recently discovered ( 69 ). Despite some discrepancies in the absolute values, both the model and observations show a consistent east–west contrast in the difference of  231 Pa/ 230 Th between LGM and PD ( Fig. 3 B ), lending support to the change in the three-dimensional structure of AMOC between these two periods."

175,introduction,"Introduction Due to rising atmospheric CO 2 , the ocean is experiencing changes in physical, chemical, and biological environments with critical impacts on ocean ecosystems 1 – 3 . Increases in surface stratification due to global warming are projected to limit surface nutrient supply and decrease biological productivity in low-to-mid latitudes during the 21st century. A global decline in biological productivity is likely to continue beyond the 21st century, but attributing this long-term change to enhanced surface stratification alone is difficult, because upper ocean changes occur on relatively short timescales 4 , 5 . Instead, long-term productivity changes are more likely caused by nutrient redistribution between different ocean basins and/or different water depths 2 , 6 , with nutrient concentrations decreasing in much of the upper Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins but increasing in the Southern Ocean. The associated mechanisms for this nutrient redistribution remain debated. A recent study attributes global nutrient redistribution on centennial timescales to nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean 2 , hinging on coupled changes in wind-driven deep water upwelling and biological activity in the Southern Ocean. As the climate warms, Southern Hemisphere westerly winds are predicted to shift poleward and intensify 7 , 8 , potentially increasing circumpolar upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters in the Southern Ocean. The resulting biological productivity enhancement in the Southern Ocean, due to nutrient increases and favorable warm growth conditions, would increase the vertical export of organic matter that transfers nutrients from the surface to the deep ocean, where sinking particles are remineralized. This enhanced biological export reduces nutrient concentrations in the northward subducting waters that sustain low-latitude biological productivity today 9 . Together, these processes are thought to result in nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean 2 . Critically, if these Southern Ocean processes dominate the centennial global nutrient redistribution, the upper-ocean nutrient reduction would be most prominent in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the northward subducting intermediate and mode waters. However, this cannot fully explain the nutrient structure changes simulated by earth system models 2 , where nutrient concentrations decline more significantly in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, additional processes are required to explain Southern Ocean nutrient trapping and global nutrient redistribution. Investigation of nutrient cycling in the ocean is also important for understanding past ocean and climate changes. Multi-centennial nutrient reorganization occurred during the last deglaciation. Paleoclimate records suggest enhanced diatom production around the Antarctic Polar Front during Heinrich events 10 , 11 , when the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was believed to be substantially weakened 12 , 13 . The enhanced diatom production was interpreted as evidence for increased Southern Ocean upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters 10 , 11 , 14 , driven by an intensification and/or southward shift of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds 15 , 16 . However, more recent theoretical and modeling studies suggest a much weaker sensitivity of the Southern Ocean upwelling to westerly wind changes due to compensation effects from transient and standing eddies 17 – 20 . Thus, the dominant factors affecting the centennial global nutrient redistribution warrant further investigation. In this study, we highlight the role of transient overturning circulation responses, involving interactions between the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific basins, in the global redistribution of nutrients and biological productivity reduction in a warming climate on centennial time scales (Fig.  1 ). Following a weakening of the AMOC, a typical feature of a warming climate 21 , 22 , the Indo-Pacific ocean develops an overturning circulation anomaly that opposes the Atlantic changes (black dashed arrows in Fig.  1 ) 23 . This inter-ocean response is established via the propagation of planetary waves, associated with a global adiabatic deepening of density surfaces (blue dashed arrows in Fig.  1 ) 23 – 25 . This process is distinct from previous views of Indo-Pacific overturning changes that involve the initiation/enhancement of deep and/or intermediate water formation in the Pacific 26 – 29 .

Color shadings show climatological distributions of dissolved inorganic silicate (Si) from GLODAPv2 52  along  a  30° W in the Atlantic and  b  170° W in the Pacific. Following a slowdown of the Atlantic overturning (black dashed line with arrow in ( a ) shows the overturning anomaly), the Indo-Pacific develops an opposite overturning circulation anomaly (black dashed line with arrow in ( b )). These transient overturning circulation changes redistribute Si between the Southern Ocean and the northern basins, which increases Si in the Southern Ocean (“+”) and reduces Si in the Indo-Pacific (“−”). Associated with these overturning adjustments, isopycnal surfaces deepen (blue dashed arrows) and bring nutrient-depleted surface waters to greater depths, decreasing nutrient concentrations in the upper Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. The red dotted lines represent the boundary between the Southern Ocean and the northern basins. More specifically, changes in the AMOC modify the density structure in the North Atlantic. The associated stratification changes propagate into the South Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, leading to geostrophically-balanced, meridional volume transport anomalies that have opposing signs between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins (dashed arrows in Fig.  1 ). This process affects the global distribution of heat 25  and biogeochemical tracers, but has been underappreciated and underexplored in previous studies. Coupled with the vertical structure of nutrient concentrations, the transient overturning response in the Indo-Pacific causes a global reorganization of nutrients between different ocean basins (green arrow in Fig.  1 ), affecting global biological productivity in a warming climate."
176,results,"Results Nutrient and productivity changes in a warming climate We use outputs from the Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2; see “CESM2 simulations” in “Methods”), as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 30 . In response to atmospheric CO 2  quadrupling (“4×CO 2 ”), the surface ocean stratification increases rapidly over the first 100 years, due to surface warming, and then levels off (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). This rapid stratification increase, which restricts nutrient entrainment into the euphotic layer (“CESM2 simulations” in “Methods”), suppresses diatom production and organic matter export in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins (Supplementary Figs.  2  and  3 ). Primary production continues to decrease in much of the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic basins over the next few centuries (Fig.  2 a, b and Supplementary Fig.  2 ). However, these long-term biogeochemical responses can no longer be explained by surface stratification, which only increases minimally after  ~100 years. Instead, the multi-centennial decline in biological production is related to a global reorganization of nutrients (Fig.  2 c–f and Supplementary Figs.  4  and  5 ). Here we focus on the distribution of dissolved inorganic silicate (Si), which is critical to diatom production and surface organic matter export 31 . Si decreases in much of the subsurface Indo-Pacific basin, with maximum reductions at around 1 km water depth in the North Pacific, and in the upper 1.5 km of the Atlantic, but Si increases in much of the Southern Ocean and in the deep Atlantic, exhibiting a nutrient redistribution between different ocean basins (Fig.  2 ).

The red dotted lines represent the boundary between the Southern Ocean and the northern basins. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. This nutrient redistribution was previously attributed to wind-driven circumpolar enhancement of deep water upwelling and increases in biological production in the Southern Ocean 2 , but this mechanism cannot fully explain the structure of nutrient changes in the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, if the global nutrient redistribution is dominated by Southern Ocean processes, the enhanced biological production would lead to the largest nutrient reductions in the cores of intermediate/mode waters in the Southern Hemisphere near 1 km water depth, inconsistent with the simulated substantial nutrient reductions in the North Pacific (Fig.  2 d). We note that a long-term decline of biological productivity in the northern basins may reduce subsurface nutrient levels in the North Pacific, but the associated processes would primarily redistribute nutrients vertically along the water column, not between ocean basins (Supplementary Fig.  5 ). Transient overturning circulation adjustments and nutrient redistribution The global nutrient redistribution, occurring on centennial timescales, is better explained by transient adjustments of the global ocean overturning circulation. Following atmospheric CO 2  quadrupling, the ocean's overturning circulation adjusts to changes in surface forcing. A prominent feature is a slow-down of the AMOC (Fig.  3 a and Supplementary Fig.  6 ) 22 . At similar water depths where the AMOC weakens, an overturning circulation anomaly with an opposing sign develops in the Indo-Pacific (Fig.  3 a, b), characterized by a northward transport anomaly in the upper 1 km and a southward transport anomaly at greater depths (dashed arrow in Fig.  1 b). During the overturning circulation adjustments, the Indo-Pacific overturning response,  Δ ψ P , largely compensates for the AMOC weakening,  Δ ψ A , at 30° S on centennial timescales, i.e.,  Δ ψ P  ≈ − ψ A  (Supplementary Fig.  6b ). However, nutrient distributions differ between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. Nutrients are more enriched in the deep Indo-Pacific and have stronger vertical gradients over the upper 3 km due to weaker ventilation, as compared to the Atlantic (Figs.  1  and  2 c, e). As such, when the compensating overturning circulation changes in the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic basins are coupled with the different vertical nutrient gradients, a net redistribution of nutrients into the Southern Ocean occurs (see “Nutrient transport” in “Methods”).

The southward Si redistribution causes nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean with the Southern Ocean Si content increasing by 37% in 1,000 years (Supplementary Fig.  8 ). A further decomposition of the Si transport into different basins shows that the Southern Ocean Si increase arises from exchanges with the Indo-Pacific basin (red line in Fig.  3 c), and thus, is not a circumpolar response as suggested in previous studies. The associated southward Si transport anomaly is due to transient overturning circulation responses, linked to the concomitant AMOC weakening, coupled to characteristic Si distributions with enriched Si and stronger vertical gradient in the Indo-Pacific (orange line in Fig.  3 c). The Si transport is northward across 30° S in the Atlantic basin (blue line in Fig.  3 c), largely due to the AMOC weakening (green line in Fig.  3 c). Taken together, we show that transient overturning circulation changes can substantially impact large-scale nutrient transport and redistribution in the world oceans (Fig.  3 ). We reach the same conclusion using previous model outputs 2 , i.e., the centennial nutrient redistribution between the Southern Ocean and the northern basins in a warming climate is predominantly due to transient overturning circulation adjustments between the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.  9 ). While the previously proposed mechanism for Southern Ocean nutrient trapping may be useful to explain intermediate depth nutrient changes, we continue to find that overturning circulation changes and the associated isopycnal deepening are necessary to account for most of the nutrient changes in the subsurface Indo-Pacific and the upper Atlantic oceans (see “Nutrient changes due to adiabatic isopycnal movements” in “Methods”; Supplementary Fig.  10 ). Specifically, isopycnal surfaces deepen to balance the transient overturning adjustment 23  and bring nutrient-depleted water to greater depths (blue arrows in Fig.  1 ), causing nutrient concentrations to decline in much of the global upper ocean. Roles of wind and buoyancy The poleward shift and strengthening of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds (Supplementary Fig.  11 ) has been thought to cause stronger upwelling of nutrient-rich deep waters 15 , 32  and also contribute to nutrient increases in the Southern Ocean. However, in the CESM2 simulations, the Southern Ocean overturning circulation changes only briefly produce a small southward Si transport anomaly during the first 100 years, and then the sign reverses (pink line in Fig.  3 d). Thus, the nutrient redistribution into the Southern Ocean is unlikely due to surface wind induced circumpolar upwelling changes 2 . To explore the underlying processes that affect the overturning circulation and nutrient redistribution, we assess the respective roles of surface winds and buoyancy changes, which have been extensively studied but heavily debated in the literature. We use an ocean-biogeochemical model, based on MITgcm, to carry out a set of process-based numerical experiments, which allow us to separate the respective roles of wind and buoyancy in affecting the overturning circulation and nutrient redistribution (see “Ocean-biogeochemical model setup” in “Methods”). Under surface wind and buoyancy forcings from CESM2 4×CO 2 , our MITgcm runs largely reproduce the global ocean nutrient reorganization in CESM2 (Supplementary Fig.  12 ). Most of the global nutrient redistribution is attributable to changes in surface buoyancy forcing, rather than surface winds (Fig.  4  and Supplementary Fig.  13 ). The strengthening and poleward shift of Southern Hemisphere westerly winds increases Ekman pumping and surface nutrients only in regions close to Antarctica (Fig.  4 a–c). In the broader Antarctic Circumpolar Current region, however, the southward shift of westerly winds weakens Ekman pumping and shifts the nutrient-rich deep waters to greater depths, leading to a decrease in surface nutrient concentrations (Supplementary Fig.  14 ; see “Nutrient changes due to adiabatic isopycnal movements” in “Methods”). Changes in surface buoyancy forcing, due to CO 2  quadrupling, cause a reduction in nutrient concentrations in much of the global upper 2 km (Fig.  4 d–f) that resembles nutrient changes in CESM2 4×CO 2  (Fig.  2 d, f), along with the southward nutrient redistribution driven by transient overturning changes (Supplementary Fig.  13c ). Despite nutrient increases in the subsurface Southern Ocean, surface nutrient concentrations decline in the Southern Ocean. This likely occurs because surface warming and freshening increase surface stratification 33  and reduce nutrient supply into the surface mixed layer from the deep ocean.

Δ Si is calculated as the difference from the MITgcm control run, which is forced with surface forcing taken from CESM2 piControl. For modeling details, see “Ocean-biogeochemical model setup” in “Methods”. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. The MITgcm results show that changes in Southern Hemisphere westerly winds only marginally affect the global nutrient distribution. Therefore, we conclude that changes in surface buoyancy cause transient adjustments of the global overturning circulation that redistribute nutrients from the Indo-Pacific into the Southern Ocean."
177,discussion,"Discussion The deep Indo-Pacific contains a large amount of dissolved inorganic nutrients and carbon. Yet, previous studies on the ocean’s role in climate transitions have largely focused on physical processes that connect the overturning circulation between the Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. The impact of Indo-Pacific overturning changes remains critically under-explored. A change in the strength and structure of the AMOC is likely to be a key component of the climate’s response to anthropogenic forcing. Transient adjustments of the overturning circulation on centennial timescales associated with AMOC changes, as shown recently, involve interactions primarily between the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific 23  and could affect distributions of biogeochemical tracers, including nutrients and carbon. Here, we show that transient Indo-Pacific overturning circulation changes, associated with AMOC weakening, cause a southward nutrient redistribution from the Indo-Pacific into the Southern Ocean in a warming climate and lead to nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. This nutrient reorganization contributes to a long-term decline of oceanic biological productivity in the Indo-Pacific, as documented previously 34 – 36 . The transient overturning circulation adjustments also provide mechanistic insights into past climate changes. For example, coral temperature records show significant subsurface warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific during Heinrich events and the Younger Dryas during the last deglaciation 37 . The subsurface warming on multi-centennial time scales is most likely due to isopycnal deepening in the broad low-to-mid latitudes that balances the Indo-Pacific overturning circulation anomalies associated with AMOC weakening 25 . The nutrient redistribution by transient overturning changes might have also supplied more Si to the Southern Ocean and contributed to increases in diatom production close to the Antarctic Polar Front during Heinrich events 10 , 14 . However, we note that diatom records during Heinrich stadials represent mean climate variations under different background climate conditions and on timescales (multi-centennial to millennial) longer than those discussed in this study. Further studies are required to understand processes controlling past ocean circulation, nutrient reorganizations, and the time scales over which these processes occur. Nutrient cycling is intrinsically linked to the global ocean carbon cycle and atmospheric CO 2  changes. Previous studies have heavily relied on Southern Ocean processes (e.g., changes to westerly winds) to explain changes in nutrient distribution and carbon cycle 2 , 32 , 38 . Our study suggests that processes in the North Atlantic, via transient overturning circulation changes between the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific basins, play a critical role in regulating global nutrient distributions on centennial timescales. The global upper-ocean nutrient decline (Fig.  2 ) due to transient overturning changes suggests a more efficient biological carbon pump that may help increase oceanic CO 2  uptake 39 . Dissolved inorganic carbon and Si have similar distributions in the ocean. Thus, transient overturning circulation adjustments, associated with AMOC changes, also inevitably redistribute carbon between different ocean basins and trap more carbon in the deep ocean as well as in the Southern Ocean (Supplementary Fig.  15 ), increasing deep ocean carbon storage."

180,introduction,"INTRODUCTION In response to future anthropogenic forcing, some Earth system components might undergo abrupt transitions. These components have come under focus as so-called tipping elements, which are systems that can abruptly change their state under small changes in forcing. This can happen, for example, for systems that exhibit multistability, implying that they could abruptly transition between alternative stable equilibrium states when a critical forcing threshold is passed ( 1 ,  2 ). Such systems include the Amazon rainforest, the Antarctic ice sheets, the Greenland ice sheet (GIS), and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Evidence that these Earth system components can indeed abruptly change states comes both from Paleoclimate evidence and from theoretical arguments that transitions can occur under future anthropogenic forcing ( 2 ). Transitions of these tipping elements would have severe impacts on climate, ecosystems, and societies from local to regional scales, and their research is thus of high priority. However, both the probability of future tipping and the degree of warming or other forcing factors under which this might happen remain highly uncertain ( 3 ,  4 ). This is in part due to the lack of such abrupt transitions in the recent observational records and in part due to the difficulty of modeling such nonlinear systems using comprehensive coupled climate models. Beyond persisting concerns that these models are biased toward excessive stability ( 5 ), they are designed for climate projections with given forcing scenarios, not for predicting individual events in time. Despite the lack of critical transitions in the observational record, historical observations can still be used to inform us on the changes in stability of Earth system components. When changes in forcing cause multistable systems to approach a transition to a different state, they typically exhibit so-called critical slowing down (CSD), in which their response to perturbations changes in a characteristic manner ( 6 ). The most commonly used CSD indicators are the variance and autocorrelation of a time series ( 7 ), which increase as the system’s stability decreases. In addition, Boers ( 8 ) introduced the autoregressive restoring rate λ as a CSD parameter, since λ can be estimated in a way that accounts for nonstationary driving noise. These indicators have been used to identify CSD changes in many systems, including the GIS ( 9 ), the AMOC ( 8 ,  10 ), and parts of global vegetation cover ( 11 ,  12 ), in particular the Amazon rainforest ( 13 ). As CSD occurs when a system’s stability declines on the approach of a critical transition, the identification of these changes can be seen as a warning of such an approaching transitions, and so they are often called early warning signals (EWS) ( 7 ). It may seem natural to take an extra step and use the statistical changes in historical data not only to show a historical and potentially ongoing destabilization but also to extrapolate into the future and predict a tipping time. Although the utility of such predictions, if robust, would be undeniable, the problem lies in the multiple levels of uncertainty inherent to such extrapolations from historical data. In this work, we focus on three types of uncertainties: (i) the modeling assumptions underlying methods for tipping time prediction; (ii) the representativeness of the typically low-dimensional observations, e.g., in terms of fingerprints, of suggested multistable Earth system components that are complex, large, spatially extended, and thus high-dimensional systems; and (iii) the impact of uncertainties and preprocessing on observational datasets, with focus on nonstationary observational coverage and the way gaps are filled. Below, we will first introduce the three sources of uncertainty in detail and show how they, in general, pose substantial problems for predicting tipping times of any Earth system component. Thereafter, we will go into further detail and exemplify the various difficulties in predicting tipping times from historical data by showing how the different factors influence the predicted tipping time for the AMOC. For the latter, we will focus on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method that was recently introduced by Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen (2023) ( 14 ) (hereafter DD23), who applied it to a sea surface temperature (SST)–based fingerprint of the AMOC and predicted that the AMOC would tip around the middle of the 21st century. We show that the described uncertainties are too large to predict a tipping time for the AMOC. Although some of the quantitative results of this work are specific to the AMOC, we show that these types of uncertainties will be present in any attempt to extrapolate a future tipping time of proposed Earth system tipping elements from historical data."

Modeling assumptions
 Any method used to predict a tipping time will use past information to extrapolate into the future. To do this, one must make assumptions about the system in question and how it will evolve. Different methods for predicting the tipping time make different assumptions, and in this section, we will show how the methods fail when these assumptions are broken. We will investigate two methods building on conventional CSD-based EWS and one recently introduced maximum likelihood approach ( 14 ). All three methods assume that the system in question is well-described by a one-dimensional (1D) fold-type normal form bifurcation and that the evolution of the control parameter is linear in time (see Materials and Methods for details): 1) AC(1) extrapolation method: The lag-1 autocorrelation [AC(1)] is a commonly used CSD indicator, as it increases when a system approaches a bifurcation point. For a normal form bifurcation, we can use the known relationship between the AC(1), the local restoring rate γ, and the control parameter α to extrapolate when the system will reach the critical value of α. 2) λ extrapolation method: The AC(1) extrapolation method assumes the noisy disturbances to be stationary in time. However, realistically, these disturbances exhibit nonstationary time correlations. This can be accounted for by basing the extrapolation on the autoregression parameter λ obtained by regressing the increments of the system state  X t +Δ t  −  X t  onto the states  X t  themselves, using a method that accounts for driving red noise of varying correlation strength ( 8 ). Similarly to the above, in the case of a normal form bifurcation, we can then use the known relationships between λ, γ, and α to extrapolate to the time when α crosses its critical value. 3) MLE method: Third, we investigate the maximum likelihood estimator for fold-bifurcation normal form systems originally proposed in DD23 ( 14 ). In this approach, the probability density of discrete time increments in the nonlinear fold-bifurcation model is approximated by a discretization scheme. The model parameter choice of maximum probability, based on the observed discrete time increments, is obtained through an optimization routine. The most fundamental assumption made in all these methods is that the system in question can undergo tipping for a given forcing. However, not all systems can undergo tipping, and as the methods assume tipping, they are susceptible to false positives. We now apply the three methods to time series generated by a linear model without any bifurcation but with an added mean trend, forced with red noise that increases in correlation strength (see Materials and Methods). The first and third method above predict tipping for this system ( Fig. 1 ). For such a linear system, the ideal method would give the tipping time as infinite (i.e., no tipping time). However, the MLE method always predicts a finite tipping time, and the AC(1) extrapolation only gives an infinite tipping time for about a quarter of the cases. The generalized least squares (GLS)–based regression method is designed to account for nonstationary correlated noise, and its results do not indicate a notable decrease in system stability. Despite that, it still gives a finite tipping time for about half of the cases. This is due to the estimation of the slope—since the extrapolation method relies on extending an estimated slope regardless of its significance, the estimated slope will center around 0 but, because of the noise, λ will in practice slightly increase or decrease around 50% of the time ( Fig. 1 ). On the basis of any reasonable statistical significance test, one would rightly conclude that the system in question does not approach a critical transition. Although the risk of false positives is reduced when using the GLS-based regression method to infer λ, one can still not rule out that λ would increase (note that we define λ to be negative so an increase toward zero is interpreted as loss of local stability) for other reasons than the system approaching a bifurcation point; e.g., the local restoring rate of a linear model with only one equilibrium can increase as the result of stretching out the basin of attraction in the vicinity of the equilibrium, resulting in increasing λ although, by construction, the system would not be able to tip. Fig. 1. Tipping time estimation for data stemming from a linear model with no possibility of tipping. ( A ) A time series of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process driven by nonstationary red noise (RN) is shown. A nonlinear decreasing mean trend is added to the resulting time series realization. Such low-frequency variability is commonly observed in natural systems and need not indicate an approach toward a tipping point. It could likewise be due to an only partly observed oscillation. ( B ) The three methods for estimating the tipping time are used on 10 4  trajectories of the linear system: AC(1) extrapolation (orange), λ extrapolation (pink), and the MLE method (turquoise). The distributions are estimated using standard Gaussian kernel density estimation and then scaled to the fraction of times estimated between 1000 and 5000. Numbers in the figure corners show the percentages of estimates outside the figure range and at infinity. Although no tipping is possible, the method relying on the AC(1) and the MLE approach purport such an existence in a large fraction of cases, as shown in the pie charts on the right. The method relying on a GLS model comes close to the ideally expected performance of indicating tipping in 50% of the cases, which is due to an underlying constant stability being symmetrically estimated (see the text). Even if the system can undergo tipping, many internal and external complexities can cause the above methods to be substantially biased. We examine the methods’ performance in the most commonly used model for a system with a bifurcation: the fold normal form bifurcation. In reality, we cannot assume that the fold normal form is applicable to climate tipping elements, as we will discuss specifically for the AMOC in the next section. Nevertheless, here, we show that tipping point prediction can fail even when the assumption of this simple model holds. The normal form of a fold-type bifurcation is given by d x d t = − b ( x ( t ) 2 − α ) (1) where  x  is the system state,  b  is a timescale parameter, and α is the bifurcation parameter of the system. The stable equilibrium  x * ( α ) = α  is characterized by a linear restoring rate of  γ = 2 b α  . Under the assumption that the system is forced by white noise, one can devise the model-specific extrapolation of the bifurcation parameter by examining log[AC(1)] 2  ∼ α and log(λ + 1) 2  ∼ α. If this bifurcation parameter evolves linearly, then this gives a more adequate estimation of the tipping time than linearly extrapolating the indicators themselves (see Materials and Methods). The DD23 MLE method was also developed specifically for this model structure. In  Fig. 2A , we give the distributions obtained by applying the different methods to 10 4  sample time series of length 2000 time units each, all from a fold normal form with white noise and linear forcing. The method proposed by DD23 performs best, which is to be expected, as that method makes use of the known model structure in a statistically optimal way. The two methods relying on extrapolating trends in CSD indicators are biased toward too early tipping times and exhibit large spread. This is mostly due to the propagation of estimation errors of AC(1) and λ through the inversion log(·) 2  with respect to their relation to α and through the subsequent linear regression. While this estimation error could be avoided by fitting the exponential directly, such a fit comes with its own substantial errors. Fig. 2. Tipping time estimation for data stemming from different variations of the fold-bifurcation normal form (FNF) model. ( A ) The distributions are derived from 10 4  model trajectories (see Materials and Methods for all model equations). The three methods used are AC(1) extrapolation (orange), λ extrapolation (pink), and the MLE method (turquoise). In (A), the model is driven by white noise (WN) and a linearly evolving forcing α. This constitutes the case for which all considered estimation methods were designed. For the MLE method, the accumulation of estimates at time 2000 is rooted in the method’s inherent optimization constraints. A tipping time earlier than the time series end at time 2000 is not possible in this framework, and the optimization terminates at this value. ( B ) Results for a model driven by nonstationary red noise (RN) with increasing correlation strength and a linearly increasing forcing. The model investigated in ( C ) exhibits a nonlinear trend of the bifurcation parameter, which decelerates as time progresses. The time series underlying the results of ( D ) are identical to those of (A), barring an added white measurement noise (MN), whose strength decreases as time progresses, mimicking reduced observational uncertainties over time. Note that the two CSD-based methods remain biased toward too early tipping time estimates, while the MLE methods is, in this case, biased toward too late estimates. All distributions are estimated using Gaussian kernel density estimation and scaled to the fraction of times estimated between 1000 and 5000. Numbers in the figure corners show the percentage of estimates outside the figure range and at infinity. As already seen above ( Fig. 1 ), assuming that uncorrelated noise is driving the system (which in realistic situations is indeed rarely justified) can lead to complications when attempting to estimate the tipping time. Accordingly, the first and third methods are biased toward too early tipping times when applied to data from a fold normal form system driven by red noise with increasing correlation strength ( Fig. 2B ). For the AC(1) extrapolation, this bias adds on top of the estimation error described above. In contrast, for the λ extrapolation method using the GLS model, the nonstationary red noise does not induce an additional bias on top of the estimation bias. Last, for the MLE method, there is a clear shift toward too early tipping times compared to the white noise case. 
Stationarity of past trends
 In addition to making assumptions about the underlying dynamical model, to predict a future tipping time, we also have to assume how the forcing of the system will change in the future. In particular, all of the methods above rely on the fact that the forcing will continue to evolve in the same way it has in the past. It is typically not easy to identify the exact climate variable that acts as the primary forcing parameter for a given climate tipping element. For example, while one might assume that global mean temperature (GMT) might be appropriate for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, all the involved processes and the different latitudinal temperature distributions indicate that this would likely be an oversimplification ( 15 ). Similarly, for the Amazon rainforest, one might think that mean annual precipitation is the likely forcing parameter, but the rainfall seasonality and dry season length play important roles as well ( 16 ,  17 ). For the AMOC, the effective freshwater flux in the north Atlantic could be considered the key control parameter, but again, given that this is a spatially extended system with shifting regions of deep water formation, it is unclear how to define an accurate control parameter in detail ( 18 ). For any of these systems, there is no evidence that their control parameters, even if known, would be linearly dependent on GMT. Furthermore, although the logarithm of the atmospheric CO 2  concentration (and hence its radiative forcing) has increased linearly since 1850, it is unlikely that this linear increase will continue. The only scenario under which log(CO 2 ) would continue to increase linearly is the extreme of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5.85 (SSP5.85) (fig. S1), a scenario in which there is not only no climate mitigation but also a rapidly growing fossil fuel–based economy ( 19 ). In addition, while anthropogenic global warming is usually assumed to be driving climate systems toward a tipping point, it is not the only substantial factor altering their conditions. For example, deforestation can be a large factor in destabilizing tropical rainforests ( 20 – 22 ). Such time-varying influences cannot be represented by a linearly evolving control parameter. Thus, while the conceptual view of only one external control parameter evolving linearly toward a critical value is sometimes sufficient to describe the historical time evolution of a given climate system, we argue that it is too simplistic to allow for an estimate of the tipping time. The three extrapolation methods discussed above assume a linear trend in the bifurcation parameter α. They therefore produce biased results when applied to time series of a model whose bifurcation parameter changes nonlinearly, e.g., in a decelerating manner.  Figure 2C  shows the corresponding estimation results. In principle, any extent of misinterpretation of observations is possible if the underlying evolution of a system toward a tipping point cannot be assumed to be stationary. 
Representativeness of measurements for underlying dynamics
 The above modeling uncertainties arise when one assumes that the time series used are a direct representation of the climate system in question. In practice, that is rarely the case. Tipping elements in the climate are complex, spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, and it is always a crude simplification to describe their dynamics by a 1D observational time series. Moreover, it is often unclear whether the relevant dynamical properties of the system in question are captured well by the available measurements. For example, the Amazon rainforest is observed using different remotely sensed vegetation indices, but it remains hard to tell which one is appropriate for understanding its stability ( 11 ,  23 ). The problem is further complicated by the relatively short time span of many climate observations. Tipping elements such as the polar ice sheets or the AMOC evolve over long timescales, and so, time series of a hundred years or more would be necessary to understand and predict their dynamics. When there are no direct measurements on such long timescales, studies use different proxies (“fingerprints”) for the systems. These fingerprints are climate variables that have some physical connection to the system of interest and are thus, to some extent, correlated with the changes of the system. For example, ice core–derived Greenland melt rates have been used as a fingerprint for ice sheet height and SST patterns as a fingerprint for the AMOC streamfunction strength ( 9 ,  24 ). Similarly, satellite-derived vegetation indices should be interpreted as—uncertain and potentially biased—fingerprints of the actual vegetation dynamics ( 11 ,  23 ). Fingerprints that are useful for understanding the evolution of the mean trend are not necessarily useful for predicting tipping times. In conclusion, there are often no fingerprints available with the precision required for predicting tipping times, as we will discuss for the AMOC in the next section. 
Effect of dataset preprocessing and underlying uncertainties /nonstationary coverage
 In addition to the uncertainties arising from the modeling approach and the choice of fingerprint, there are also substantial uncertainties in CSD indicators that originate from the dataset preprocessing steps and the nonstationarity of observational data coverage ( 23 ,  25 ,  26 ). The number of available climate observations has grown exponentially since 1850 ( 27 ,  28 ), especially with the increase of remote sensing measurements since the 1970s. In earlier years, these measurements are often concentrated in a small number of areas on the globe, resulting in uneven and sparse global coverage until at least the mid-20th century ( 28 ). Therefore, to produce globally complete datasets, researchers often merge a number of different instrumental records and fill in the gaps in data using a processing procedure. The bias correction for the different measurements and the infilling methods often prioritize the accuracy of the mean trend over the accuracy of the higher-order statistics [see, for example, ( 23 ,  29 – 32 )]. This can cause problems for the detection of CSD ( 23 ,  25 ,  26 ,  33 ) and especially for the calculation of the future tipping time. Any calculation of the future tipping time is strongly reliant on the time evolution of the data’s higher-order statistics, and the dataset preprocessing can induce artificial trends in these statistics. To this point, we show the effect of adding white measurement noise of a decreasing amplitude to the synthetic model data of the fold normal form and estimate tipping times using the introduced methods.  Figure 2D  shows how a small amount of observational uncertainty can incur substantial changes in the estimations. One real-world example of such an effect is the merging of multiple satellite signals. The change in signal-to-noise ratio from one satellite to the next can cause an artificial increase in autocorrelation ( 23 ). Another issue emerges when missing data are infilled with some sort of principal components analysis, in which case there will be more artificial smoothing in earlier times due to the lack of data, and so quantities like the variance could increase artificially ( 26 ,  29 ). In the next section, we will discuss such dataset uncertainties in detail for the AMOC SST fingerprints. Uncertainties in predicting the AMOC tipping time We now address these uncertainties for the specific case of predicting the tipping time of a system by applying DD23’s MLE-based method to SST-based fingerprints of the AMOC ( 14 ). We choose to use DD23’s methodology because among the three discussed methods, it performs best for a fold normal form with white noise ( Fig. 2A ) and was designed for AMOC tipping time prediction. 
Modeling assumptions
 There has long been a discussion about whether the AMOC, when investigated as a complex system under external forcing of, e.g., GMT (or better, regional freshwater forcing), exhibits multiple stable states ( 34 – 36 ). Transitions between such stable states could be bifurcation induced and thus abrupt and irreversible. The so-called fold bifurcation constitutes a minimal example of such behavior. For instance, the conceptual Stommel model of the AMOC features a fold bifurcation ( 34 ). Taking this reasoning another step further, the application of the MLE method assumes that the 1D observable of AMOC strength is well represented by the following normal form model d X t = − b ( ( X t − m ) 2 − α ) d t + b σ d W t (2) where  X t  is the system state at time  t , α is the external control parameter,  b  is a timescale parameter,  m  is a translation parameter, and the white noise term σd W t  represents noisy perturbations within the system. A similar simplification has been applied to more complex AMOC models in multiple studies ( 37 ,  38 ) and is justified by arguing that all fold bifurcations are topologically equivalent to this model. This, however, is only true locally, in potentially very close proximity to the bifurcation point, while the proposed estimation method banks on the assumption that it would hold in arbitrary distance to the bifurcation point. On the basis of the arguments brought forth, we do not see a direct constraint on the dynamics away from the tipping point. When applying the MLE method to data of the closely related 2D Stommel-Cessi AMOC model ( 39 ), one obtains a considerable bias in tipping time estimates toward earlier times ( Fig. 3A ). This should be seen as an indication that even models with an underlying fold bifurcation structure, yet not following the very specific normal form model equation above, produce time series which, when applying the MLE method, yield biased tipping time estimates. Fig. 3. Tipping time estimation for data stemming from variations of the conceptual Stommel-Cessi (SC) model. The distributions depict the estimations of the tipping time for 10 4  model runs (see Materials and Methods for model equations). ( A ) Tipping times estimated from data obtained from the 2D Stommel-Cessi model with a linear forcing parameter. ( B ) Same as (A) but using a nonlinear forcing which decelerates over the integration time span. This is a model setting with practical relevance, as the anthropogenic changes forcing the AMOC cannot be assumed to be constant. ( C ) Same setting as (A) but with white measurement noise added, with constant (green) increasing (light brown) and decreasing (dark brown) amplitude. As above, distributions are estimated with Gaussian kernel density estimation and then scaled to the fraction of times estimated between 1000 and 5000. Numbers in the figure corners show the percentages of estimates outside the figure range and at infinity. The tipping time estimates in each panel are biased because the data does not stem from the exact intended model expected by the MLE method of DD23. ( D  to  F ) The Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots beneath each panel give the model fit of the derived maximum likelihood model to the data of one sample. The tipping time estimate of the respective sample is indicated by the triangle in the top panel. A comparison of the QQ plots suggests that time series stemming from the 2D Stommel-Cessi model are similarly well-modeled by the proposed fold normal form model with white noise forcing as the AMOC time series of DD23 [figure 6F in ( 14 )]. The AMOC exhibits pronounced decadal variability ( 40 ). Before the commencing of the destabilisation at time  t 0 , the AMOC is assumed to resemble paths of a stationary stochastic process  X  defined by d X t = − 2 b α ( X t − m ) d t + b σ d W t (3) When applying their MLE method to the AMOC, DD23 estimates a value of  2 b α ≈ 3.1   [ yea r − 1 ]  , corresponding to a characteristic correlation time of 0.32 [year]. In contrast, frequency spectra of AMOC evolutions in general circulation models show strongest variability between 5 and 100 years [e.g., figure 6 in ( 41 )]. Such pronounced additional variability on long timescales is not captured by the above Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. Internal variability independent of the model noise will thus cause large excursions from the transient mean. The proposed method is not equipped to incorporate the impact of these excursions on the estimated tipping time, since they may be misinterpreted as trends toward a tipping point. This exposes the estimation method to risks of false alarms of a similar nature as in  Fig. 1 . In addition, recent application of DD23’s MLE method to AMOC tipping in a complex climate model ( 42 ) has shown that the tipping time prediction is very sensitive to the time interval analyzed due to the decadal variability of the AMOC, and most 150-year windows cannot accurately estimate the tipping time. Moreover, for quantitative extrapolations of tipping time, any simplifying assumptions on the driving noise would need to be carefully checked. Since disturbances to the equilibrium state are themselves of atmospheric and oceanic origin, time correlation of the noise should be taken into consideration, e.g., via a red noise model ( 8 ). Nonstationary red noise present in the system can incur substantial biases in the estimation of the tipping time and even result in false alarms of an approaching bifurcation (as seen in  Figs. 1  and  2B ). 
Assumptions on future AMOC forcing
 Previously, we discussed the fact that not only can we not assume the future evolution of the forcing of climate tipping elements to be known, we also cannot assume that the forcing evolved linearly in the past. This is also true for the AMOC: Several studies show that radiative anomalies due to aerosol pollution likely attenuated the AMOC weakening of the past decades ( 43 ,  44 ), and such changes cannot be modeled with a linearly changing control parameter. Moreover, the GMT forcing itself influences the AMOC due to many different nonlinear mechanisms, e.g., via thermal expansion, a strengthening hydrological cycle, as well as sea ice and ice sheet melt (with the influence of the latter in the historical period still under debate) ( 45 ,  46 ). The effective freshwater flux might serve as a better forcing parameter ( 35 ,  47 ), but we do not have long-term measurements of this parameter, and there is evidence that it does not linearly depend on GMT; e.g., Greenland runoff increases nonlinearly over time ( 48 ,  49 ). 
Representativeness of the subpolar gyre SSTs for AMOC
 Because of the lack of long-term observations, various fingerprints have been proposed ( 50 ). The most commonly used fingerprint for the AMOC is based on SSTs in the subpolar gyre (SPG), and a modified version of this fingerprint is used by DD23 to predict AMOC tipping. This fingerprint is based on the assumption that the so-called warming hole in the North Atlantic, an area which is cooling as opposed to the global warming trend detected essentially everywhere else, is caused by a weakening of the AMOC ( 51 – 54 ). The classical fingerprint is defined as the SSTs averaged over the SPG area minus the global SST mean ( 24 ,  51 ) and has often been referred to as the “SPG Index.” However, that term is also used in the literature to describe indices related to the characteristics of the SPG circulation ( 55 ). In this work, we therefore call this AMOC fingerprint the SPG-based AMOC index. This index has been supported by two lines of evidence. First, across models, the historical trends in the SPG-based AMOC index in CMIP6 models correlate with the trends in the AMOC streamfunction (at various latitudes), in the sense that models with higher AMOC strength trend also have higher SPG-based AMOC index trends ( 24 ,  44 ). Second, the SPG-based AMOC index time series itself is correlated with the AMOC streamfunction time series at various lag times (depending on the study either the maximum of the streamfunction is taken or its value at different latitudes) ( 51 ,  56 – 58 ). However, both these correlations have been shown to be highly nonstationary and are sensitive to the time period, to the forcing scenario and to the underlying processes ( 56 ,  58 ). This is likely due to the fact that the warming hole is not driven solely by the AMOC but is a result of both changes in ocean heat transport and changes in atmospheric forcing ( 59 – 63 ). This partial connection of the SPG to the AMOC is supported by recent studies using the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program, which have shown that the Labrador Sea and the SPG play a smaller role in North-Atlantic deep water formation than previously thought ( 64 ,  65 ). The nonstationarity of the correlation between AMOC streamfunction and the SPG-based AMOC index does not imply that this index is not useful for studying the stability of the AMOC, as the SPG still plays a crucial role in the AMOC and would thus be sensitive to its stability changes ( 26 ,  45 ,  66 ,  67 ). Signs of CSD in the SPG region thus still likely indicate a destabilization of the AMOC. However, the nonstationarity does reduce the fingerprint’s usefulness for exact predictions of tipping times. This is particularly true due to the lack of agreement over the precise nature of this nonstationarity, which means that we have no way of accounting for it when using the fingerprint. We believe that for predictive purposes, including those based on extrapolation, it is problematic to fit a simple bifurcation model representing the AMOC to a fingerprint whose correlation with the AMOC changes over the time period under consideration. To obtain a better representation of the AMOC, different proposed fingerprints should be compared. The uncertainty in fitting a model to the SPG-based AMOC index alone can then be inferred by comparing the results of the CSD analysis and extrapolation for the different fingerprints. There is a long list of identified AMOC fingerprints in the literature, and many of them as robust and commonly used as the SPG-based AMOC index ( 50 ,  57 ). When one applies DD23’s MLE method to one of these other fingerprints, the so-called dipole fingerprint ( 68 ), the estimated tipping time varies considerably and sometimes even goes to infinity ( Fig. 4  and tables S1 and S2). Since there is now no consensus on which of these fingerprints better represents the AMOC, the range of estimated tipping times highlights substantial uncertainty in such estimations. Fig. 4. Range of tipping times. Tipping times estimated using DD23’s MLE method. The best estimate of the tipping time is calculated for the classical SPG-based AMOC index (plus), the fingerprint used by DD23 (circle), and the Dipole index (star). We use three different observational SST datasets for this analysis: HadISST1 (turqoise), ERSSTv5 (orange), and HadCRUT5 (blue). In addition, the blue violins show the tipping times for each of the 200-member uncertainty ensemble of HadCRUT5. (See fig. S2 for a version of the tipping time calculation applying an additional penalization; cf. section S2 of DD23 for details). The plotted values can be found in tables S1 and S2. It should also be noted that there is growing evidence supporting the SPG as a potential tipping element separate from the AMOC ( 1 ,  69 ,  70 ). Although an SPG collapse occurs only in some coupled climate models under future warming scenarios, these models are among the best in representing the stratification in the SPG ( 69 ,  70 ). We cannot, therefore, disregard the possibility that CSD in the SPG-based AMOC index is in reality an indication of an approaching SPG tipping point and not an AMOC tipping point. The only way to avoid this uncertainty is to include additional AMOC fingerprints which do not rely on SPG SSTs ( 8 ). 
Uncertainties from the SST datasets
 We have shown in a conceptual example how simple forms of measurement noise can cause complications for the estimation of the tipping time (see  Figs. 2D  and  3C ). For the prediction of an AMOC tipping time, the main source of uncertainty arising from the SST datasets is caused by the infilling methods. For example, in their study, DD23 uses the HadISST1 SST dataset, which has been infilled using reduced space optimal interpolation (RSOI) ( 29 ). RSOI uses a set of global empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and includes regularizing terms when fitting the EOFs to the data. This is done to avoid spurious large amplitudes in data-scarce regions and times but means that the fit tends to the zero anomaly where there is no information. Although noninterpolated in situ data are subsequently added to the RSOI reconstruction, this only improves the variance where there is enough data—in data-scarce times and regions, the variability is damped by RSOI. Together with other steps of the preprocessing, this causes the variance in HadISST1 to artificially increase [see ( 26 ,  29 )]. To highlight the effect of dataset processing methods on the tipping time calculation, we use DD23’s MLE method to calculate tipping times for the AMOC, using three different datasets: the previously mentioned HadISST1 ( 29 ), HadCRUT5 ( 30 ), which uses a Gaussian process–based statistical method for infilling, and ERSSTv5 ( 32 ), which uses empirical orthogonal teleconnections for infilling. All of these dataset methods result in different variance and autocorrelation time series (see  Fig. 5 ), as does the noninfilled HadSST4 ( 28 ). The variance is especially affected by the various preprocessing methods of the different datasets—only in HadISST1 does the variance increase over the whole time period—and as noted above, this increase is at least partly artificial. It is therefore not possible to determine the actual variance trend of north Atlantic SSTs before the 1970s. While the autocorrelation and the restoring rate are arguably still functional indicators given the dataset properties [see ( 26 )], DD23’s MLE method relies on the variance and does not take these uncertainties, the nonstationary observational coverage and the different gap filling procedures into account. Fig. 5. Variance and autocorrelation for different SST datasets and AMOC fingerprints. The rows from top to bottom show the monthly AMOC fingerprints ( A  to  C ), variance ( D  to  F ), and autocorrelation ( G  to  I ). The columns from left to right show the values for the fingerprint from DD23 (left), the classical fingerprint from Caesar  et al.  ( 24 ) (middle, SPG-based AMOC index), and the AMOC dipole fingerprint ( 50 ) (right). The dipole is defined as averaged SSTs in 45° to 80°N, 70°W to 30°E minus SSTs in 0° to 45°S, 70°W to 30°E. The time series are shown for four different datasets: HadISST1 (turqoise), ERSSTv5 (orange), HadCRUT5 (blue), and HadSST4 (pink). In (A) to (C), the AMOC fingerprints are offset by 3 K from each other for better visibility. All CSD indicators are computed using a window size of 50 years. Note that the variance shows overall decreases in most cases, partly due to the nonstationary data coverage ( 26 ). In addition, note that the calculation of the SPG-2xGMT fingerprint in this work is slightly different from in DD23 (see Materials and Methods). When applying DD23’s MLE method to their version of the AMOC fingerprint but calculated from alternative SST datasets, we obtain tipping times ranging from the 2000s for HadISST to the 3000s for ERSSTv5. If this analysis is extended to different AMOC fingerprints (see the previous subsection), then the tipping times range from the 2000s to beyond the year 4700 for ERSStv5 (table S2). Last, if we apply the method to HadCRUT5’s 200-member uncertainty ensemble, we get multimillennial uncertainty ranges with, for some cases, almost a quarter of the tipping times going to infinity (table S1). This shows that the fingerprint definition and the dataset choice can cause huge uncertainties."
182,discussion,"DISCUSSION Regardless of the Earth system component under consideration, it is inevitable that at least some of the assumptions discussed above will be broken in reality and that the types of uncertainties addressed in this work will indeed arise when attempting to extrapolate tipping time from past historical data. First, simplified modeling assumptions will almost always be necessary for extrapolation, since the future behavior of the system will be different depending on the governing dynamics. Past data can inform us about the relevant model, but typically, many different models can match the data, as seen above. Second, the problem of finding a time series that accurately represents the dynamics of the system is common to all tipping elements. Last, the problems caused by nonstationary data coverage and data processing methods described above are unavoidable, since data processing is always necessary to assimilate and calibrate observations and proxies, especially for longer records. However, it is important to emphasize that the criticisms in this work apply to attempts to predict the exact tipping time of tipping elements such as the AMOC, based on extrapolating from uncertain data. CSD detection in terms of trends in robust indicators such as the autocorrelation or the restoring rate is much less sensitive to the discussed uncertainties, whereas the variance should indeed be used with caution ( 8 ,  25 ,  26 ). In principle, CSD is applicable to any sort of dynamical system that is approaching a transition induced by a codimension one bifurcation. In addition, fingerprints that are not an exact representation of a dynamical system will still show CSD as long as the stability of the subsystem they represent is connected to the stability of the overall system. Crucially, the uncertainties presented in this work can be taken into account by using multiple different fingerprints and propagating the dataset uncertainties to the CSD analysis. Such an analysis has already been applied to the AMOC by Ben-Yami  et al.  ( 26 ), who found that CSD in AMOC fingerprints in terms of a restoring rate tending toward zero, is still significant although the trends in the CSD indicators have a large spread. Taking into account the same observational uncertainty spread for the tipping time, however, gives time ranges from 2050 to infinity, practically making this prediction noninformative. This is because tipping time prediction is not only more sensitive to uncertainties but also relies on more assumptions and in particular presumes that there will be a tipping time in the future. Therefore, for the prediction method to be useful, it needs to narrow down the future range of tipping times to an informative range. In contrast, a detection of CSD does not make statements about future tipping, only about the fact that the system is now less stable than it was in the past. Although the example we put most focus on was the predicted tipping time of the AMOC, the work of Boers and Rypdal (2021) ( 9 ) (hereafter BR21) could also be interpreted as a prediction of tipping time for the central-western part of the GIS. The same kinds of uncertainties apply to that work. BR21 derive the potential landscape of the ice sheet height by fitting a previously introduced nonlinear model ( 71 ), which makes many assumptions. The change in ice sheet height is calculated from average annual melt rates obtained from three ice cores in central-western Greenland, and in addition to uncertainties in the underlying data that are difficult to quantify, it is highly uncertain how well this location represents the whole ice sheet ( 49 ). A potential tipping time could be identified with the bifurcation point of the fitted model (red vertical dashed line in figure 3 of BR21). However, the uncertainties from the assumptions of the simplified model and the reconstruction uncertainties imply that the estimated bifurcation point should not be understood as an estimate of the actual critical threshold and should certainly not be translated into a tipping time ( 9 ). We have discussed multiple sources of uncertainty in the prediction of future tipping times of Earth system components. These uncertainties are as follows: 1) The modeling assumptions underlying the methods for tipping time estimation 2) The viability of extrapolating past forcing trends into the future 3) The reliability of using indirect fingerprints to predict tipping times of climate tipping elements 4) The uncertainties that arise from the bias and preprocessing in observational datasets with measurement uncertainties and gaps The latter two points above may be addressed in time by improved Earth system observations and waiting (possibly for hundreds of years, depending on the characteristic timescale of the system) until sufficiently long records are available. Regarding the first point, it is unclear whether the highly nonlinear and complex dynamics governing the proposed tipping elements will ever be reliably modeled at the accuracy needed for tipping time prediction. Last, regarding the second point, it will never be possible to know the change in future forcing, so any extrapolation will always be uncertain as it would assume a specific future scenario. In addition, we have described in detail how these uncertainties manifest for the specific example of predicting a future AMOC tipping time, using the MLE method introduced by DD23 ( 14 ): 1) The modeling assumptions underlying DD23’s MLE method for tipping time predictions are too simple and do not necessarily hold for the AMOC. We have shown that breaking these assumptions by, e.g., changing the dynamical model for the AMOC or the model for the forcing introduces large biases in the tipping time estimation ( Fig. 4 ). In particular, their method also predicts a tipping time for a linear model that cannot tip, if forced by red noise with increasing correlation strength. 2) The connection of the SPG-based AMOC fingerprint (computed from SSTs) to the AMOC is uncertain and nonstationary and therefore is problematic for exact predictions of tipping times. Using different SST fingerprints with the HadISST dataset can change the predicted tipping time by 70 years (table S2). 3) The inherent uncertainties of SST datasets and the preprocessing methods used to fill in missing data can be nonstationary and thus affect higher-order statistics such as the variance or autocorrelation. In particular, the HadISST dataset used by DD23 is known to have an artificial variance increase. Using different SST datasets and their uncertainty ensembles, the tipping time varies by thousands of years (tables S1 and S2). In the foreseeable future, points 2 and 3 will essentially form impassable barriers to predicting the time of a future AMOC collapse from historical data. The available data are simply not accurate or precise enough to make such an extrapolation. In conclusion, we showed that the uncertainties discussed in this work are too large to allow for reliable estimates of the tipping time of major Earth system tipping elements, including the AMOC, the polar ice sheets, or tropical rainforests, based on extrapolating results from historical data. We emphasize that these uncertainties, originating from underlying modeling or mechanistic assumptions as well as from the used empirical data, need to be taken into account and propagated thoroughly before attempting to estimate a future tipping time of any potential Earth system tipping element."
183,materials|methods,"MATERIALS AND METHODS AMOC fingerprints For each of the four used SST datasets, we compute three different SST-based fingerprints of the AMOC. First, the index introduced by DD23, which is obtained by averaging SSTs over the SPG region and then subtracting twice the global mean SSTs. Here, the SPG region is defined as in ( 24 ). Second, the original version of this index, introduced by Caesar  et al.  ( 24 ), where the global mean SSTs are only subtracted once. Third, we use the so-called dipole fingerprint, which is obtained by subtracting average SSTs of a large region in the southern hemisphere Atlantic ocean (0° to 45°S, 70°W to 30°E) from average SSTs in a large region in the northern hemisphere Atlantic (45° to 80°N, 70°W to 30°E). For computing the spatial averages for the HadISST data, we mask out all values of grid cells covered by sea ice following ( 8 ,  24 ) and also use a weighted mean to account for the dependence of the grid cell size on the latitude. Formulae for conceptual models Here, we give the formulae of all models which have been integrated to obtain time series data for the subsequent analyses in  Figs. 1  to  3 . The abstract models of the first two figures were integrated for a total simulation time span of 2000 time units and sampled at time step 1. For the first 1000 time units, the dynamics are held constant, i.e., no evolution in the bifurcation parameter or the noise is present. At time  t 0  = 1000, these nonstationarities commence. They are aimed toward a horizon of  t c  = 3000. The ramp duration is thus τ r  = 2000. For the application in the AMOC setting, we emulate AMOC time series data from the year 1870 to 2021 and generate these at a monthly time step, i.e., 1/12 years. We emphasize, however, that there is no seasonality in these simulated time series. The ramp parameters are  t 0  = 1924,  t c  = 2125, and thus τ r  = 201. The linear model of  Fig. 1  is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by another Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. After the integration, a mean trend is added to the dynamics. d X t = − γ X t d t + κ U t d t (4) d U t = − 1 τ noise   ( t ) U t d t + d W t (5) τ noise ( t ) = τ 0 noise ( 1 − Θ [ t − t 0 ] ( t − t 0 ) / τ r ) + τ t c noise   Θ [ t − t 0 ] ( t − t 0 ) / τ r (6) x trend ( t ) = 1 − Θ [ t − t 0 ] ( t − t 0 ) / τ r (7) where d W t  is the white noise forcing, making the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process  U  a red noise forcing. Θ is the Heaviside function, γ = 0.2 is the linear restoring rate, κ = 0.023 is the noise strength, and  τ 0 noise = 1 / 3  and  τ t c noise = 2  determine the linear evolution of the noise correlation. Further, τ r  determines both the ramp of the noise correlation and of the added trend. The original fold bifurcation normal form model with white noise forcing is given by the following equation for d X t . The equations for α( t ) define different forcings: linear forcing [α lin ( t )] or decelerating forcing [α slow ( t )] d X t = − b ( X t 2 + α ( t ) ) d t + b σ d W t (8) α lin ( t ) = α 0 ( 1 − Θ [ t − t 0 ] ( t − t 0 ) / τ r ) (9) α slow ( t ) = α 0 ( 1 − Θ [ t − t 0 ] ( t − t 0 ) / τ r ) 1.5 (10) Here,  b  = 0.1 is a timescale parameter, σ = 0.05 is the amplitude of the noise, α 0  = 1 is the value of the bifurcation parameter before the start of the linear ramp, and Θ is again the Heaviside function. The red noise model underlying  Fig. 2B  uses the same noise term as in the above linear model but with  κ = 0.0045  ,  τ 0 noise = 1 / 4  and  τ t c noise = 10 . Instead of the fold bifurcation normal form, a specialized model might be more suitable to represent AMOC dynamics. To this end, we implement the dimensionless version of the 2D Stommel-Cessi model ( 39 ) given by d X t = b ( − X t ( 1 + η 2 ( X t − Y t ) 2 ) + α ( t ) ) d t + b σ d W t X (11) d Y t = b ( − ε − 1 ( Y t − 1 ) − Y t ( 1 + η 2 ( X t − Y t ) 2 ) ) d t + b σ d W t Y (12) with  b  = 0.1, ε = 0.01, σ = 0.04, and η 2  = 7.5. The two white noise terms acting on the components are independent. α( t ) decreases from α 0  = 5 to α t c  = 1.128. This decrease is linear or nonlinear for the analyses of  Fig. 3 (A and B) , respectively. All of the models were integrated using the Euler-Maruyama scheme to obtain time series data. Estimation methods for time of tipping Three approaches to estimating the tipping time have been discussed and compared quantitatively in the Results section. We refer to them here as (i) AC(1) extrapolation, (ii) λ extrapolation, and (iii) the MLE method introduced by DD23. All of them build on the assumption that the system in question is well-represented by a 1D fold-type bifurcation in its normal form. The corresponding model equation is given by the deterministic part of  Eq. 8 . Methods 1 and 3 also assume the given stochastic white noise part of the same equation, while method 2 relies on a model suited for both white and nonstationary correlated (red) noise. We give here a more detailed description of the first two methods. For more information on the third method, we refer to ( 14 ), where it was originally proposed. The synthetic time series underlying the comparison of the methods in the Results section consist of a stationary and a nonstationary part each. The MLE method uses both parts to fit a model of a linear control parameter ramp starting from a known time  t 0 . The extrapolation methods use only the nonstationary part after a known time  t 0  as a basis for the linear fits. 1. AC(1) extrapolation: Before the annihilation of a system’s equilibrium point, the negative feedbacks defining said equilibrium weaken with respect to the positive feedbacks. This results in a decrease of the restoring rate with respect to small noisy disturbances. If these disturbances are assumed to be stationary in time, the the lag-1 autocorrelation [AC(1)] can serve as a measure of system stability, as it can be shown to be a function of the linear restoring rate γ, i.e., the amplitude of the continuous linearized dynamics around the equilibrium point. In particular, when linearizing the dynmics under the assumption of white noise forcing, one arrives at the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation representing the evolution of small disturbances under a negative linear feedback or linear restoring rate, γ d X t = − γ X t d t + σ d W t (13) The discrete time approximation of these linearized dynamics is  X t +Δ t  = exp (−γΔ t ) X t  + η t , where η t  denotes the noise. The AC(1) of discrete samples of this stochastic process is thus given by AC(1) = exp (−γΔ t ). Here, Δ t  denotes the time step between subsequent measurements, which we set equal to one in our simulations. As we approach the tipping point γ → 0, and thus, the AC(1) parameter approaches +1. Linearizing the fold-bifurcation normal form in  Eq. 8 , one sees that  γ = 2 b α  , where α is the bifurcation parameter. Thus, α is approximately linearly related to log[AC(1)] 2 . Observing the latter quantity and extrapolating its best linear fit toward the bifurcation threshold, which for the fold normal form is at α t c  = 0, yields an estimate of the tipping time. 2. λ extrapolation: To account for possible nonstationary time correlation in the driving noise, Boers ( 8 ) estimated system stability via regressing the increments  X t +Δ t  −  X t  onto  X t  using a GLS method designed for models driven by red noise of varying correlation strength. This regression gives the autoregression parameter λ in a model driven by discrete time red noise X t + Δ t − X t = λ X t + κ η t (14) η t + Δ t = ρ η t + ϵ t (15) where ρ symbolizes the correlation parameter of the red noise, and ϵ is the white noise. For correlation parameter ρ close to zero, i.e., η close to white noise, it can be shown that the relation λ = AC(1) − 1 = exp (−γΔ t ) − 1 holds approximately. Hence, as γ → 0 from above, we have that λ → 0 from below. Similarly to the above, the tipping time can thus be estimated by taking the time at which the linearly extrapolated log(λ + 1) 2 , as an estimate of the bifurcation parameter α, crosses the critical value α = 0. In the present applications, the quantities log[AC(1)] 2  and log(λ + 1) 2  are estimated in rolling windows centered around every 50th time series entry with a length of 100 time series entries each."
