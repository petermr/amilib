The end of this event marks the beginning of the Holocene. Using the University of Toronto version of CCSM4, a model of the climate prior to the YD was created with correct boundary conditions. Various amounts of freshwater forcing were then applied to the Beaufort Gyre for forcing intervals ranging from 1 to 125 years. In several cases, this was sufficient to collapse the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and cause significant cooling over the NH. Crucially, after the forcing was ceased, the AMOC stayed in an off state for approximately a millennium before mounting a rapid recover to pre-YD levels. This recovery, which permanently reduced the extent of NH sea ice, occurred through the mechanism of a Polynya opening in the Irminger Sea during winter and led to a pronounced \"overshoot\" of the AMOC, during which NH temperatures were higher than before the YD.", "affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. jvitow@physics.utoronto.ca.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "CGSD3 - 547034 - 2020", "agency": "Gouvernement du Canada | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "CGSD3 - 547034 - 2020", "agency": "Gouvernement du Canada | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Conseil de Recherches en Sciences Naturelles et en G \u00e9nie du Canada)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "Discovery Grant A9627", "agency": "Walter C.
