Exploring the variation and influencing factors of N-cycling-related genes is of great significance for controlling the eutrophication of lakes. However, seasonal dynamics of genomic information encoding nitrogen (N) cycling in sediments of eutrophic lakes have not yet been clearly addressed. We collected sediments in the Baiyangdian (BYD) Lake in four seasons to explore the dynamic variation of N-cycling functional genes based on a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach and to reveal their key influencing factors. Our results showed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA), assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), and denitrification were the dominant N-cycling processes, and the abundance of <i>nirS</i> and <i>amoC</i> were higher than other functional genes by at least one order of magnitude. Functional genes, such as <i>nirS</i>, <i>nirK</i> and <i>amoC</i>, generally showed a consistent decreasing trend from the warming season (i.e., spring, summer, fall) to the cold season (i.e., winter). Furthermore, a significantly higher abundance of nitrification functional genes (e.g., <i>amoB, amoC and hao</i>) in spring and denitrification functional genes (e.g., <i>nirS, norC and nosZ</i>) in fall were observed. N-cycling processes in four seasons were influenced by different dominant environmental factors. Generally, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or sediment organic matter (SOM), water temperature (T) and antibiotics (e.g., Norfloxacin and ofloxacin) were significantly correlated with N-cycling processes. The findings imply that sediment organic carbon and antibiotics may be potentially key factors influencing N-cycling processes in lake ecosystems, which will provide a reference for nitrogen management in eutrophic lakes.", "affiliation": "School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["brief-report", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Seasonal changes", "Sediments", "Shallow lake", "Functional genes", "N-cycling"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1363775"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10876089"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10876089?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-02-20", "firstIndexDate": "2024-02-21", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-02-23", "dateOfRevision": "2024-02-21", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-02-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-02-05"}
