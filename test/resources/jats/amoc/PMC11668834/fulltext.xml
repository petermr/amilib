An important consideration in their experimental design is the choice of initialization procedure as this influences the duration of initial-condition memory, with implications for interpreting the temporal evolution of both the ensemble-mean and ensemble-spread. Here we leverage the strategic design of the 100-member Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) SMILE to investigate the dependence of ensemble spread on the method of initialization (micro- vs. macro- perturbations) and the effects of ocean initial-condition memory. We find that the evolution of ensemble spread in 10-year low-pass filtered data is relatively insensitive to the method of initialization beyond the second decade, with the notable exception of the tropical Indo-Pacific in the 4th decade, when macro-initialization significantly enhances ensemble spread, possibly as a result of a state-dependent response to major volcanic activity. Initial-condition memory associated with the chosen Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) states unfolds in two stages: First, in the North Atlantic lasting 4&#x02013;5 decades, and subsequently, in the Indo-Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean appearing 35-years after initialization and lasting 3&#x02013;4 decades. Known AMOC dynamics explain the first stage, but the role of AMOC and the mechanisms responsible for the delayed appearance of initial-condition memory in the Southern Ocean remain to be fully elucidated. Implications and recommendations for the design of future SMILEs are provided.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00382-024-07553-z.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PCEFP2 203376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wills</surname><given-names>Robert C.

A hallmark of SMILEs is the ability to unambiguously separate the evolving characteristics of internal climate variability from those of the forced response at local and regional scales in a given model. This separation is achieved by conducting many simulations with the same model and the same radiative forcing protocol (historical and/or future scenario) but varying the initial conditions. The resulting ensemble spread is thus solely attributable to differences in the trajectories of internal variability across the individual members. Once the memory of the initial conditions is lost, the sequences of internal variability will be randomly phased amongst the members such that the forced component at a given location and time can be estimated by averaging the simulations together, provided a sufficient ensemble size, and the internal component in each member can be obtained as a residual from the forced component. The accuracy of the estimated forced response depends on the number of members available for averaging and may differ according to the spatio-temporal scale and quantity of interest. For example, very large ensembles (order 100 members) may be required to detect forced changes in the characteristics of internal variability (e.g., Milinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Rodgers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>) while smaller ensembles (order 10 members) may be sufficient for detecting forced changes in the mean state (e.g., Deser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Fasullo and Nerem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Wills et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). The proliferation of SMILEs in recent years attests to their enormous value for studying the evolving nature of climate variability and change at local and regional scales, and providing quantitative information needed for risk assessment and adaptation/planning purposes.</p><p id="Par3">An important aspect of the experimental design of SMILEs is the choice of initialization procedure, as this influences the duration of initial-condition memory and has implications for the evolution of ensemble spread (Drotos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>). Many SMILEs employ a so-called &#x0201c;micro-initialization&#x0201d; procedure by introducing a small random perturbation to the initial atmospheric temperatures (on the order of the model&#x02019;s numerical round-off error, e.g., 10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;14</sup>&#x000a0;K; Deser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref> and Kay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>) or to the initial ocean temperatures at a single, randomly chosen grid cell (on the order of 10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;3</sup> K; Hawkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). Other SMILEs use a so-called &#x0201c;macro-initialization&#x0201d; approach by selecting different coupled model states taken from a long pre-industrial control (Pictl) simulation. These Pictl states are typically chosen at random a decade or more apart depending on the availability of the restart files (Maher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>; Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>; Voldoire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>; Doscher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>; Boucher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>), although more strategic approaches based on maximizing spread in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) or in ocean heat content (OHC) contrasts between the Pacific and Atlantic have also been employed (see Hawkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref> and Stevenson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2023</xref>; respectively). Finally, some SMILEs employ a combination of micro- and macro-initialization procedures (Hawkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Kirchmeier-Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>; Rodgers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>). Regardless of the criteria used for selecting macro initial states from a Pictl simulation, long-term drift and/or decadal-to-centennial quasi-periodicities need to be considered. Indeed, long-term drift was the main source of spread in OHC of the Southern Ocean across the set of macro initial states in Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>). Further, Stevenson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2023</xref>) caution that many models exhibit multi-centennial OHC variability in their Pictl simulations, thereby introducing long-term memory effects associated with the macro states used to initialize historical SMILE simulations. The impact of long-term drift and/or low-frequency variability in Pictl simulations is typically overlooked in analyses of SMILEs based on macro-initialization (Bonnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref> is a notable exception).</p><p id="Par4">The extent to which the method of initialization affects the behavior of ensemble spread through time in a given model has, to the best of our knowledge, been addressed in only two studies to date: Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) and Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>). Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) employed a low-resolution intermediate complexity model (5&#x000b0; x 7.5&#x000b0; with 11 vertical levels in the atmospheric component and 2.5&#x000b0; x 3.75&#x000b0; with 20 vertical levels in the ocean component) under idealized radiative forcing (1% per year compound increase in CO<sub>2</sub> over 140 years) and focused on European climate. Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>) used a relatively high-resolution Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)-era model (approximately 2&#x000b0; in the atmosphere and 1&#x000b0; in the ocean) under historical and future (RCP8.5) radiative forcing and focused on the Southern Ocean. Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) concluded that &#x0201c;an ensemble using a range of different oceanic initial conditions produces a larger spread in temperature trends than ensembles using a single ocean initial condition at all lead times&#x0201d;, while Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>) found &#x0201c;a discernible impact of varying ocean initial conditions on ensemble variance over the Southern Ocean is evident throughout the full 150 simulation years of the ensemble&#x0201d;. The extent to which the conclusion of Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) holds for more complex models and radiative forcing scenarios remains to be ascertained. Similarly, the predominant influence of model drift on the evolution of OHC from the macro initialization states used in Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>) calls for additional investigation into initial-condition memory effects after accounting for model drift. A recent study by Stevenson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2023</xref>) provides a comparison of ensemble spread behavior in upper-ocean heat content and surface temperature across SMILEs initialized with different approaches, but model differences in addition to differences in initialization procedures prevented them from drawing definitive conclusions.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we employ a recent state-of-the-art 100-member SMILE strategically designed to allow investigation of the dependence of ensemble spread on micro vs. macro initialization as well as ocean initial-condition memory effects (Rodgers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>). This SMILE was conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), a CMIP6-era model at nominal 1&#x000b0; resolution (Danabasoglu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). Each member of the CESM2 SMILE starts from a different initial condition as described in Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> and is subject to the same radiative forcing protocol (historical from 1850 to 2014 and SSP3.70 from 2015 to 2100), with the exception of the biomass burning emissions in the late 20th and early 21st centuries being temporally smoothed in the second set of 50 members compared to the first 50 (Rodgers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>), although this does not impact the period of simulation that is of interest here. We focus our analysis on the evolution of upper ocean temperatures and surface climate variables over the first 6 decades of the historical simulations, when the impact of initialization is expected to be most pronounced. Although there is relatively little drift in the CESM2 Pictl, we take care to remove this drift from the historical SMILE simulations before assessing their ensemble spread and initial-condition memory. Our aim is to document the degree to which the method of initialization and choice of ocean initial conditions affect ensemble spread in the CESM2 SMILE. We hope that our findings will stimulate future investigations of the physical mechanisms governing the sensitivity of ensemble spread to these methodological choices. Finally, our results may help to inform the design of future SMILEs and provide context for analyses of internal variability and forced responses in SMILEs.</p><p id="Par6">The rest of this study is organized as follows. The CESM2 SMILE experimental design is presented in Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>a. Methods for removing drift based on the Pictl simulation, decomposing ensemble variance into contributions from macro vs. micro initialization, attributing ensemble variance to ocean initial-condition memory, and statistical significance testing based on bootstrapping the Pictl simulation are given in Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>b.

A discussion of mechanisms underlying initial-condition memory related to AMOC and the potential role of external forcing in enhancing ensemble spread due to macro-initialization are provided in Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>a and 4b, respectively.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>), and the remaining macro initial states were randomly selected from the Pictl simulation at 10-year intervals, similar to the procedure in Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2023</xref>). The four different AMOC initial states were selected from years 1231&#x02013;1301 of the Pictl. These initial states sample minimum, maximum, and transition states of an AMOC Index representing the maximum transport at 45&#x000b0;N associated with the North Atlantic Deep Water (hereafter, AMOC45N) and the closely related Labrador Sea (53&#x000b0;-65&#x000b0;N, 60&#x000b0;-45&#x000b0;W) Sea Surface Height (SSH) Index (hereafter, LabSeaSSH) as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (red circles). The rationale for choosing these indices is based on previous work which shows that low-frequency fluctuations in AMOC45N and LabSeaSSH provide a major source of decadal memory and predictability in the climate system (Yeager and Danabasoglu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). [Note that the selection criterion was incorrectly stated in Rodgers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>) as being based on the AMOC Index at 26&#x000b0;N as opposed to 45&#x000b0;N (their Fig. S2).] The choice of Pictl years 1231&#x02013;1301 from which to select the AMOC initial states was dictated by the length of the Pictl simulation (1400 years) at the time the SMILE was configured (the Pictl was subsequently extended to 2000 years). By this time, the Pictl exhibited minimal drift in AMOC45N and LabSeaSSH, and showed a prominent quasi-centennial oscillation in both indices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We aimed to sample this large-amplitude, slowly-varying fluctuation by selecting Pictl years 1231, 1251, 1281 and 1301 for the 4 AMOC initial states (indicated by the red circles in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Hereafter, we shall refer to these cases by their year of initialization: AMOC1231 (minimum LabSeaSSH, maximum AMOC45N); AMOC1251 (rising LabSeaSSH, declining AMOC45N); AMOC1281 (maximum LabSeaSSH, minimum AMOC45N); and AMOC1301 (declining LabSeaSSH, rising AMOC45N). Twenty-member ensembles for each AMOC initial state were generated by randomly perturbing the initial atmospheric temperatures by order 10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;14</sup>&#x000a0;K (following the &#x0201c;micro perturbation&#x0201d; protocol used for all members of the CESM1 SMILE; Kay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>). We shall refer to these 4 AMOC ensembles collectively as &#x0201c;AMOC4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par11">

To remove this drift from each member of the CESM2 SMILE, we compute the linear trend in the Pictl simulation based on years 800&#x02013;1599 and then subtract this trend from each member of the SMILE. Our de-drifting procedure is insensitive to the exact set of years used from the pictrl (not shown).

In the first decade, macro-initialization produces significantly greater spread compared to micro-initialization over much of the Arctic, Atlantic and Southern Oceans as well as over portions of the tropical Indian and eastern Pacific basins, with normalized differences on the order of 30&#x02013;80% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). This signal is expected due to the persistence of macro state variance (in particular, ocean initial condition memory as will be discussed below). By the second decade, significant differences are mainly limited to the SPNA and Arctic, and these diminish almost entirely by the 3rd decade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h-i). Surprisingly, the 4th decade shows a coherent region of statistically significant differences in ensemble spread over the eastern tropical Pacific emanating from the coast of Chile, as well as in two narrow bands on either side of the equator in the western Pacific, with values&#x02009;~&#x02009;30&#x02013;60% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>j); these features decay in the 5th decade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>k). Statistically significant differences in ensemble spread reappear in the 6th decade over the western half of the tropical Pacific, with two prominent bands of values&#x02009;~&#x02009;30&#x02013;60% along ~&#x02009;10&#x000b0;N and ~&#x02009;10&#x000b0;S, corresponding to locations of maximum Rossby wave activity (Capotondi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>). The areas of significant differences in macro vs. micro ensemble spreads over the tropical Pacific in the 4th -6th decades correspond roughly to the regions where external forcing has significantly enhanced macro ensemble spread (recall contours in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d-f).</p><p id="Par31">Turning to TS, the pattern of s<sub>macro</sub> features maximum values along the sea ice margins in the Arctic and Antarctic, secondary maxima over the SPNA and the northern and tropical Pacific, and a weaker enhancement over Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes especially the Pacific sector (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a-f). The regional patterns of enhanced ensemble spread in the Atlantic and Pacific correspond to well-known modes of decadal variability, in particular Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>) and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Mantua et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1997</xref>), which CESM2 (among other models) is able to simulate (see Deser and Phillips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2023</xref> and Capotondi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; respectively). The amplified ensemble spread over the marginal sea ice zones reflects the high TS variability associated with transitions between sea ice and open water conditions (e.g., Deser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). Over land, TS ensemble spread is generally largest over the northern continents as expected due to pronounced atmospheric circulation variability and associated thermal advection in middle latitudes (e.g., Deser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Shepherd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>) in addition to positive snow-albedo feedback processes (e.g., Alexander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>).

This sensitivity is primarily confined to T<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;m</sub> and TS over the SPNA and Arctic, with spread due to macro-initialization significantly exceeding that due to micro-initialization by 30&#x02013;80% depending on location. These fractional differences result mainly from significant suppression of micro-perturbation ensemble spread compared to the Pictl simulation (recall Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). An unexpected resurgence of statistically significant macro vs. micro ensemble spread differences appears in the 4th decade (1880&#x02013;1889) over the tropical Indo-Pacific in all four variables examined, with fractional values ranging from 30 to 60%. We speculate that this coordinated signal may be indicative of a state-dependent coupled tropical ocean-atmosphere response to the large sequential volcanic eruptions of Krakatoa (located in Indonesia) in 1883 and Mt. Tarawera (located in northern New Zealand) in 1886. In particular, the temporal and spatial proximity of the dual eruptions to the occurrence of significant macro vs. micro ensemble spread differences hints at a causal link. While this conjecture remains to be tested, we note that a state-dependent response to idealized tropical volcanic eruptions has been reported in previous modeling studies (e.g., Zanchettin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2022</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2023</xref>). That such a state-dependent response is preferentially manifest in the set of macro-initialized simulations may reflect their wider range of oceanic states at the time of the eruptions compared to the micro-initialized ensembles. In Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>b, we provide circumstantial evidence in support of this conjecture; however, further investigation is needed to directly test this hypothesis and understand the mechanisms underlying the state-dependent response.</p><p id="Par41">Apart from these notable regional signals, the evolution of ensemble spread over the historical period 1850&#x02013;2000 lies generally within the range diagnosed from the Pictl simulation regardless of initialization method, including globally averaged T<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;m</sub> and TS (Fig. S3). As such, our results contrast with the findings of Hawkins et al.

The increase in global T<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;m</sub> ensemble spread over the second half of the 20th century and its exceedance relative to the likely (2.5th &#x02013; 97.5th percentile) Pictl range (Fig. S3) are consistent with the findings of Stevenson et al.

While it is tempting to interpret this result as reflecting a state-dependence of long-term (e.g., 4&#x02013;5 decades ahead) AMOC predictability, external forcing produces a small (0.5&#x000a0;Sv) increase in AMOC strength over the first 50 years of the historical simulations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f in Rodgers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>), which is enough to reconcile the magnitudes of the predictable component of internally-generated trends in the four AMOC ensembles.</p><p id="Par44">

To compute these anomalies, we subtracted the average of the 4 AMOC ensemble-means from each individual AMOC ensemble-mean, and then normalized the anomalies by the Pictl standard deviation (based on detrended data during years 800&#x02013;1599) to give a sense of their relative amplitudes. For zonal averages across the Pacific sector, it is clear that AMOC1251 and AMOC1281 make the largest contribution to the statistically significant values of &#x003c7;<sub>ocean</sub> in the latitude band 40-65&#x000b0;S (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). In this region, AMOC1251 (AMOC1281) exhibits positive (negative) anomalies of up to 0.7 standard deviations in the first decade, transitioning to negative (positive) anomalies of similar magnitude from about 1885&#x02013;1935. These AMOC ensembles also exhibit contrasting Atlantic signatures, with large-amplitude anomalies (0.5&#x02013;1.5 standard deviations) of opposite polarity extending over the first 40 years of the simulations, i.e., negative (positive) anomalies in the tropics and positive (negative) anomalies in the northern extratropics for AMOC1251 (AMOC1281) corresponding to the statistically significant values of &#x003c7;<sub>ocean</sub>. While the North Atlantic anomalies in AMOC1231 and AMOC1301 resemble their respective AMOC1251 and AMOC1281 counterparts, the tropical South Atlantic anomalies differ in sign. Whether the distinctive tropical South Atlantic initial-condition memory during 1850&#x02013;1890 in AMOC1251 and AMOC1281 compared to AMOC1231 and AMOC1301 is causally linked to the initial-condition memory that appears in the late 1880s in the South Pacific remains to be investigated.</p><p id="Par55">

As discussed above, the long-lived (up to 5 decades) initial condition memory in T<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;m</sub> and SST over the SPNA and Arctic is a notable feature that can be attributed, by design, to the initial condition memory associated with different AMOC states. A mechanism that maintains long memory in the SPNA was first proposed by Yeager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>) using CESM1 and has since been confirmed with multiple models including CESM2 (e.g., Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2024</xref>) and CESM1 at high-resolution (Yeager et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>) as well as in observational data (Chafik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2023</xref>). In essence, this mechanism attributes the source of the upper SPNA thermal memory to the deep, denser limb of AMOC and its interaction with the upper, lighter limb of AMOC. In the SPNA, strong surface buoyancy forcing (e.g., associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation) generates anomalous deep, dense waters. Although a part of these waters propagates relatively quickly along the deep western boundary current, a bulk of the dense waters propagates more slowly to the south through the interior of the western SPNA (Bower et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>) and is discharged into the subtropics west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). This anomalous dense water can generate a zonal sea surface height (SSH) gradient around the MAR through the steric effect. The zonal SSH gradient drives anomalous geostrophic meridional flow that projects onto the North Atlantic Current (NAC), the major constituent of the upper AMOC limb that transports heat northward from the subtropics to the SPNA. Because the SSH anomaly spins up the entire subpolar gyre, the anomalous NAC is largely canceled by an anomalous Labrador Current (the western boundary current flowing southward along the Labrador coast) when the flows are integrated zonally. Therefore, the signature of an anomalous NAC is obscured in AMOC when depicted in conventional depth coordinates. On the other hand, because the anomalous NAC is lighter than the Labrador Current, its signature is more evident in AMOC depicted in density coordinates [AMOC(&#x003c3;); Yeager <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Consistent with this hypothesis, AMOC(&#x003c3;) <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Similar results are found for northward heat transport (not shown). Thus, volume transport is the dominant factor giving rise to the long-lived initial-condition memory in SPNA upper-ocean temperatures in the four AMOC ensembles.</p><p id="Par60">We note that the nearly 40-year AMOC memory found here is considerably longer than the 1&#x02013;2 decades reported in previous studies (e.g., Griffies and Bryan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1997</xref>; Msadek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>; Branstator and Teng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Several factors may contribute to this difference, including the amplitude and phase of the initial AMOC anomaly, model dependence, ensemble size and choice of metrics used to estimate predictability. As noted by Yeager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>), the coordinate system used to define AMOC may affect its predictability characteristics. In particular, for the cases examined here, the initial-condition memory of the northward flowing upper AMOC limb at the intergyre boundary (~&#x02009;45&#x000b0;N) is reduced from ~&#x02009;4 decades when viewed in density coordinates (densities&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;36.7&#x000a0;kg m<sup>3</sup> ) to ~&#x02009;1 decade when viewed in conventional depth coordinates (depths&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1000&#x000a0;m; Fig. S6). We would like to emphasize that while most previous studies consider predictability of AMOC defined in depth coordinates, AMOC defined in density coordinates best connects to predictability of upper ocean temperatures in the SPNA.</p><p id="Par61">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2235"><title>The potential role of volcanic eruptions on ensemble spread</title><p id="Par63">In Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>a, we speculated that the sequential volcanic eruptions of Krakatoa in May-Oct 1883 and Mt. Tarawera in June 1886, which together injected record amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> in Danabasoglu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>), may have led to the significant enhancement of ensemble spread in the tropical Indo-Pacific sector during the 1880s in the macro-initialized simulations (s<sub>macro</sub>) compared to that diagnosed from the (unforced) Pictl and compared to that in the micro-initialized simulations (s<sub>micro</sub>). This conjecture relies on two untested assumptions: (1) CESM2 simulates a state-dependent response to these volcanic eruptions; and (2) the macro-initialized ensemble samples a broader range of relevant (tropical) oceanic states at the time of the eruptions compared to the micro-initialized ensemble. Without additional experiments, we cannot determine the nature of the state-dependent response to the eruptions, since a large number of ensemble members branched from each macro simulation at the start of the eruption sequence would be required to isolate it from internal variability. However, as a preliminary step toward addressing the second assumption, we have compared s<sub>macro</sub> with s<sub>micro</sub> and with the total spread across the 80 members of AMOC4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20 (denoted s<sub>AMOC4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20</sub>) based on decadal averages over 1884&#x02013;1893 (the decade that is expected to be most relevant for a state-dependent response to the eruptions and their aftermath). The results confirm that s<sub>macro</sub> T<sub>0&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;m</sub> and s<sub>macro</sub> TS significantly exceed the 97.5th % of the Pictl distribution and significantly exceed s<sub>micro</sub> and s<sub>AMOC4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20</sub> over substantial portions of the tropical Pacific (black contours in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>a-f). Likewise, the results confirm that s<sub>macro</sub> SLP significantly exceeds the Pictl 97.5th % and s<sub>micro</sub> and s<sub>AMOC4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20</sub> over much of the tropical Indo-Pacific in a pattern that resembles the Southern Oscillation (black contours in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>g-i). While s<sub>macro</sub> PR significantly exceeds the Pictl 97.5th % over the Arabian Sea, western tropical Pacific and along the South Pacific Convergence Zone, its significant exceedance relative to s<sub>micro</sub> and s<sub>AMOC4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20</sub> is limited to the Arabian Sea (black contours in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>j-l). Further analysis and experiments are needed to fully address the potential role of Krakatoa and Tarawera on ensemble spread and to understand the physical mechanisms governing a possible state-dependent response to these eruptions.</p><p id="Par64">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Summary and implications</title><p id="Par65">Leveraging the unique strategic design of the CESM2 Large Ensemble, we have quantified the impacts of initialization method (macro vs. micro perturbation) and ocean initial-condition memory on the evolution of ensemble spread in upper-ocean temperatures and surface climate variables over the first 6 decades of the historical simulations (1850&#x02013;1909). Our results are based on decadal averages from which drift in the pre-industrial control simulation has been removed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these dual aspects of a Large Ensemble design have been quantified in a single state-of-the-art global coupled Earth system model.</p><p id="Par66">Sensitivity of ensemble spread to the method of initialization is mainly limited to upper-ocean temperatures and SSTs over the SPNA and Arctic in the first two decades, with fractional differences of up to 30&#x02013;90%. These differences are unlikely to have occurred by chance, as assessed by bootstrapped random sampling of the pre-industrial control simulation. An unexpected resurgence of statistically significant macro vs. micro ensemble spread differences occurs in the 4th decade (1880&#x02013;1889) over the tropical Indo-Pacific in all variables examined, with fractional values ranging from 25 to 50%. We speculate that the large sequential volcanic eruptions of Krakatoa and Tarawera during this decade may have induced a state-dependent response that is preferentially expressed in the macro-initialized simulations, but it is also possible that these anomalies represent delayed initial condition memory associated with internal climate variability (see Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2023</xref>). Further work is needed to understand the origins and mechanisms underlying this unexpected signal.</p><p id="Par67">There appear to be two stages of significant ocean initial-condition memory associated with the four chosen ocean initial states. The initial stage is focused in the North Atlantic and lasts for 3&#x02013;4 decades in SST and 4&#x02013;5 decades in upper-ocean temperatures. This stage can be explained by known AMOC dynamics. The second stage, located in the Indo-Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, appears approximately 35-years after initialization and lasts for ~&#x02009;30&#x02013;40 years in upper-ocean temperatures and SST. There is some evidence for eastward propagation of the signal across the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, with linkages to the subtropical southeast Pacific approximately 20 years later. Further work is needed to understand the dynamical mechanisms underlying the delayed appearance of significant ocean initial-condition memory in the Southern Ocean. We note that the ~&#x02009;20-year lag between the onset of ocean memory in the subtropics relative to higher latitudes of the southeast Pacific is quantitatively consistent with that found for the transient response to polar stratospheric ozone depletion (Dong et al. 2024). Additional investigation is also warranted to assess the predictability characteristics of each of the four AMOC ensembles individually, as they may differ depending on the phase and amplitude of the initial AMOC state.</p><p id="Par68">Our results have implications for studies using the CESM2 Large Ensemble and for informing the experimental design of Large Ensembles in general. One major implication concerns the common practice of equating the ensemble-mean at a given time with the externally forced response. This only holds true once the memory of the initial conditions is lost. We have shown that in the CESM2 Large Ensemble, initial-condition memory in upper-ocean temperatures can last up to 4&#x02013;5 decades depending on location, confounding the interpretation of the ensemble-mean as the externally forced response during the early decades of the historical simulations. To mitigate this issue, we recommend designing Large Ensembles with a buffer of several decades between the start date of the simulations and the start date of the intended period of analysis for ease of interpretation. For the same reason, we also recommend initializing Large Ensembles from a well spun-up Pictl simulation with minimal non-linear drift. With regard to initialization procedure, we recommend using a macro-initialization approach to guard against artificially limiting ensemble spread in the early decades of the historical simulations. We hope that our findings will stimulate future investigations of the physical mechanisms governing initial-condition memory effects and sensitivity of ensemble spread to methodological choices in the CESM2 Large Ensemble.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
