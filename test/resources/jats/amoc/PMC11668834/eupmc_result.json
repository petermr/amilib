An important consideration in their experimental design is the choice of initialization procedure as this influences the duration of initial-condition memory, with implications for interpreting the temporal evolution of both the ensemble-mean and ensemble-spread. Here we leverage the strategic design of the 100-member Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) SMILE to investigate the dependence of ensemble spread on the method of initialization (micro- vs. macro- perturbations) and the effects of ocean initial-condition memory. We find that the evolution of ensemble spread in 10-year low-pass filtered data is relatively insensitive to the method of initialization beyond the second decade, with the notable exception of the tropical Indo-Pacific in the 4th decade, when macro-initialization significantly enhances ensemble spread, possibly as a result of a state-dependent response to major volcanic activity. Initial-condition memory associated with the chosen Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) states unfolds in two stages: First, in the North Atlantic lasting 4-5 decades, and subsequently, in the Indo-Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean appearing 35-years after initialization and lasting 3-4 decades. Known AMOC dynamics explain the first stage, but the role of AMOC and the mechanisms responsible for the delayed appearance of initial-condition memory in the Southern Ocean remain to be fully elucidated. Implications and recommendations for the design of future SMILEs are provided.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00382-024-07553-z.", "affiliation": "NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "203376", "agency": "Swiss National Science Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07553-z"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07553-z"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11668834"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11668834?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-12-27", "firstIndexDate": "2024-12-27", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-12-27", "dateOfRevision": "2025-02-26", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-12-24", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-12-24"}
