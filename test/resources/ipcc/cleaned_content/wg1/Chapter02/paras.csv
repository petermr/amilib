wg1_ch02_2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter assesses the evidence basis for large-scale past changes in selected components of the climate system. As such, it combines much of the assessment performed in Chapters 2 through 5 of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) WGI contribution (IPCC, 2013) that, taken together, supported a finding of unequivocal recent warming of the climate system. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) WGI Report structure differs substantially from that in AR5 ( Section 1.1.2). This chapter focuses upon observed changes in climate system drivers and changes in key selected large-scale indicators of climate change and in important modes of variability (Cross-Chapter Box 2.2), which allow for an assessment of changes in the global climate system in an integrated manner. This chapter is complemented by Chapters 3 and 4, which respectively consider model assessment/detection and attribution, and future climate projections for subsets of these same indicators and modes. It does not consider changes in observed extremes, which are assessed in Chapter 11. The chapter structure is outlined in the visual abstract (Figure 2.1)."
wg1_ch02_2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Use is made of paleoclimate, in situ, ground- and satellite-based remote sensing, and reanalysis data products where applicable (Section 1.5). All observational products used in the chapter are detailed in Annex I, and information on data sources and processing for each figure and table can be found in the associated chapter Table 2.SM.1 available as an electronic supplement to the chapter. Use of common periods ranging from 56 million years ago through to the recent past is applied to the extent permitted by available data (Section 1.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.1). In all cases, the narrative proceeds from as far in the past as the data permit through to the present. Each sub-section starts by highlighting the key findings from AR5 and any relevant AR6-cycle Special Reports (SROCC, SR1.5, SRCCL), and then outlines the new evidence-basis arising from a combination of: (i) new findings reported in the literature, including new datasets and new versions of existing datasets; and (ii) recently observed changes, before closing with a new summary assessment."
wg1_ch02_2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Trends, when calculated as part of this assessment, have wherever possible been calculated using a common approach following that adopted in Box 2.2 of Chapter 2 of AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013). In addition to trends, consideration is also made of changes between various time slices/periods in performing the assessment (Section 1.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.1). Statistical significance of trends and changes are assessed at the two-tailed 90% confidence (very likely) level unless otherwise stated. Limited use is also made of published analyses that have employed a range of methodological choices. In each such case the method/metric is stated."
wg1_ch02_2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"There exist a variety of inevitable and, in some cases, irreducible uncertainties in performing an assessment of the observational evidence for climate change. In some instances, a combination of sources of uncertainty is important. For example, the assessment of global surface temperature over the instrumental record in Section 2.3.1.1.3 considers a combination of observational-dataset and trend-estimate uncertainties. Furthermore, estimates of parametric uncertainty are often not comprehensive in their consideration of all possible factors and, when such estimates are constructed in distinct manners, there are often significant limitations to their direct comparability (Hartmann et al., 2013, their Box 2.1)."

Earth’s mean temperature history during the current geological era (Cenozoic, beginning 66 Ma (66 million years ago)) can be broadly characterized as follows (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1): (i) transient warming during the first 15 Myr (15 million years) of the Cenozoic, punctuated by the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum; (ii) a long-term cooling over tens of millions of years beginning around 50 Ma, driven by (among other factors) the slow drift of tectonic plates, which drove mountain building, erosion and volcanism, and reconfigured ocean passages, all of which ultimately moved carbon from the atmosphere to other reservoirs and led to the development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) about 35–30 Ma; (iii) the intensification of cooling by climate feedbacks involving interactions among tectonics, ice albedo, ocean circulation, land cover and greenhouse gases, causing ice sheets to develop in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) by about 3 Ma; (iv) glacial-interglacial fluctuations paced by slow changes in Earth’s astronomical configuration (orbital forcing) and modulated by changes in the global carbon cycle and ice sheets on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, with particular prominence during the last 1 Myr; (v) a transition with both gradual and abrupt shifts from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present interglacial epoch (Holocene), with sporadic ice-sheet breakup disrupting ocean circulation; (vi) continued warming followed by minor cooling following the mid-Holocene, with superposed centennial- to decadal-scale fluctuations caused by volcanic activity, among other factors; (vii) recent warming related to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (Sections 2.2.3 and 3.3.1)."

From this comparison, there is medium confidence in the following: GMST estimated for the warmest long-term period of the Last Interglacial about 125 ka (125,000 years ago; 0.5°C–1.5°C relative to 1850–1900) overlaps with the low end of the range of temperatures projected under SSP1-2.6 including its negative emissions extension to the end of the 23rd century (1.0°Cto 2.2°C). GMST estimated for a period of prolonged warmth during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 3 Ma [2.5°C to 4.0°C] is similar to temperatures projected under SSP2-4.5 for the end of the 23rd century (2.3°C to 4.6°C). GMST estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum [5°C to 10°C] and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum [10°C to 18°C], about 15 and 50 Ma, respectively, overlap with the range projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (6.6°C to 14.1°C).

wg1_ch02_2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"This section assesses the magnitude and rates of changes in both natural and anthropogenically mediated climate drivers over a range of time scales. First, changes in insolation (orbital and solar; Section 2.2.1), and volcanic stratospheric aerosol (Section 2.2.2) are assessed. Next, well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs; CO2, N2O and CH4) are covered in Section 2.2.3, with climate feedbacks and other processes involved in the carbon cycle assessed in Chapter 5. The section continues with the assessment of changes in halogenated GHGs (Section 2.2.4), stratospheric water vapour, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone (Section 2.2.5), and tropospheric aerosols (Section 2.2.6). Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), their precursor emissions and key processes are assessed in more detail in Chapter 6. Section 2.2.7 assesses the effect of historical land cover change on climate, including biophysical and biogeochemical processes. Section 2.2.8 summarizes the changes in the Earth’s energy balance since 1750 using the comprehensive assessment of effective radiative forcing (ERF) performed in Section 7.3. For some SLCFs with insufficient spatial or temporal observational coverage, ERFs are based on model estimates, but also reported here for completeness and context. Tabulated global mixing ratios of all well-mixed GHGs and ERFs from 1750–2019 are provided in Annex III."
wg1_ch02_2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 assessed solar variability over multiple time scales, concluding that total solar irradiance (TSI) multi-millennial fluctuations over the past 9 kyr were <1 W m–2, but with no assessment of confidence provided. For multi-decadal to centennial variability over the last millennium, AR5 emphasized reconstructions of TSI that show little change (<0.1%) since the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715) when solar activity was particularly low, again without providing a confidence level. The AR5 further concluded that the best estimate of radiative forcing due to TSI changes for the period 1750–2011 was 0.05–0.10 W m–2 (medium confidence), and that TSIvery likely changed by –0.04 [–0.08 to 0.00] W m–2 between 1986 and 2008. Potential solar influences on climate due to feedbacks arising from interactions with galactic cosmic rays are assessed in Section 7.3.4.5."
wg1_ch02_2.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Slow periodic changes in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun mainly cause variations in seasonal and latitudinal receipt of incoming solar radiation. Precise calculations of orbital variations are available for tens of millions of years (Berger and Loutre, 1991; Laskar et al., 2011). The range of insolation averaged over boreal summer at 65°N was about 83 W m−2 during the past million years, and 3.2 W m−2 during the past millennium, but there was no substantial effect upon global average radiative forcing (0.02 W m–2 during the past millennium)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"A new reconstruction of solar irradiance extends back 9 kyr based upon updated cosmogenic isotope datasets and improved models for production and deposition of cosmogenic nuclides (Poluianov et al., 2016), and shows that solar activity during the second half of the 20th century was in the upper decile of the range. TSI features millennial-scale changes with typical magnitudes of 1.5 [1.4 to 2.1] W m–2 (C.-J. Wu et al., 2018). Although stronger variations in the deeper past cannot be ruled out completely (Egorova et al., 2018; Reinhold et al., 2019), there is no indication of such changes having happened over the last 9 kyr."
wg1_ch02_2.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recent estimates of TSI and spectral solar irradiance (SSI) for the past millennium are based upon updated irradiance models (e.g., Egorova et al., 2018; C.-J. Wu et al., 2018) and employ updated and revised direct sunspot observations over the last three centuries (Clette et al., 2014; Chatzistergos et al., 2017) as well as records of sunspot numbers reconstructed from cosmogenic isotope data prior to this (Usoskin et al., 2016). These reconstructed TSI time series (Figure 2.2a) feature little variation in TSI averaged over the past millennium. The TSI between the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715) and second half of the 20th century increased by 0.7–2.7 W m–2 (Jungclaus et al., 2017; Egorova et al., 2018; Lean, 2018; C.-J. Wu et al., 2018; Lockwood and Ball, 2020; Yeo et al., 2020). This TSI increase implies a change in ERF of 0.09–0.35 W m–2 (Section 7.3.4.4)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Estimation of TSI changes since 1900 (Figure 2.2b) has further strengthened, and confirms a small (less than about 0.1 W m–2) contribution to global climate forcing (Section 7.3.4.4). New reconstructions of TSI over the 20th century (Lean, 2018; C.-J. Wu et al., 2018) support previous results that the TSI averaged over the solar cycle very likely  increased during the first seven decades of the 20th century and decreased thereafter (Figure 2.2b). TSI did not change significantly between 1986 and 2019. Improved insights (Krivova et al., 2006; Yeo et al., 2015, 2017; Coddington et al., 2016) show that variability in the 200–400 nm UV range was greater than previously assumed. Building on these results, the forcing proposed by Matthes et al. (2017) has a 16% stronger contribution to TSI variability in this wavelength range compared to the forcing used in the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"To conclude, solar activity since the late 19th century was relatively high but not exceptional in the context of the past 9 kyr (high confidence). The associated global mean ERF is in the range of –0.06 to +0.08 W m–2 (Section 7.3.4.4)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 concluded that, on interannual time scales, the radiative effects of volcanic aerosols are a dominant natural driver of climate variability, with the greatest effects occurring within the first 2–5 years following a strong eruption. Reconstructions of radiative forcing by volcanic aerosols used in the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3) simulations and in AR5 featured short-lived perturbations of a range of magnitudes, with events of greater magnitude than –1 W m–2  (annual mean) occurring on average every 35–40 years, although no associated assessment of confidence was given. This section focuses on advances in reconstructions of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD), whereas (Chapter 7 focuses on the ERF of volcanic aerosols, and Chapter 5 assesses volcanic emissions of CO2 and CH4; tropospheric aerosols are discussed in Section 2.2.6. Cross-Chapter Box 4.1 undertakes an integrative assessment of volcanic effects including potential for 21st century effects. "
wg1_ch02_2.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Advances in analysis of sulphate records from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and AIS have resulted in improved dating and completeness of SAOD reconstructions over the past 2.5 kyr (Sigl et al., 2015), a more uncertain extension back to 10 ka (Kobashi et al., 2017; Toohey and Sigl, 2017), and a better differentiation of sulphates that reach high latitudes via stratospheric (strong eruptions) versus tropospheric pathways (A. Burke et al., 2019; Gautier et al., 2019). The PMIP4 volcanic reconstruction extends the period analysed in AR5 by 1 kyr (Figure 2.2c; Jungclaus et al., 2017) and features multiple strong events that were previously misdated, underestimated or not detected, particularly before about 1500 CE. The period between successive large volcanic eruptions (Negative ERF greater than –1 W m–2), ranges from 3–130 years, with an average of 43 ± 7.5 years between such eruptions over the past 2.5 kyr (data from Toohey and Sigl, 2017). The most recent such eruption was that of Mt Pinatubo in 1991. Century-long periods that lack such large eruptions occurred once every 400 years on average. Systematic uncertainties related to the scaling of sulphate abundance in glacier ice to radiative forcing have been estimated to be about 60% (Hegerl et al., 2006). Uncertainty in the timing of eruptions in the proxy record is ± 2 years (95% confidence interval) back to 1.5 ka and ± 4 years before (Toohey and Sigl, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"SAOD averaged over the period 950–1250 CE (0.012) was lower than for the period 1450–1850 CE (0.017) and similar to the period 1850–1900 (0.011). Uncertainties associated with these inter-period differences are not well quantified but have little effect because the uncertainties are mainly systematic throughout the record. Over the past 100 years, SAOD averaged 14% lower than the mean of the previous 24 centuries (back to 2.5 ka), and well within the range of centennial-scale variability (Toohey and Sigl, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Direct observations of volcanic gas-phase sulphur emissions (mostly SO2), sulphate aerosols, and their radiative effects are available from a variety of sources (Kremser et al., 2016). New estimates of SO2 emissions from explosive eruptions have been derived from satellite (beginning in 1979) and in situ measurements (Höpfner et al., 2015; Carn et al., 2016; Neely III and Schmidt, 2016; Brühl, 2018). Satellite observations of aerosol extinction after recent eruptions have uncertainties of about 15–25% (Vernier et al., 2011; Bourassa et al., 2012). Additional uncertainties occur when gaps in the satellite records are filled by complementary observations or using statistical methods (Thomason et al., 2018). Merged datasets (Thomason et al., 2018) and sparse ground-based measurements (Stothers, 1997) allow for volcanic forcing estimates back to 1850. In contrast to the CMIP5 historical volcanic forcing datasets (Ammann et al., 2003), updated time series (Figure 2.2d; Luo, 2018) feature a more comprehensive set of optical properties including latitude-, height- and wavelength-dependent aerosol extinction, single scattering albedo and asymmetry parameters. A series of small-to-moderate eruptions since 2000 resulted in perturbations in SAOD of 0.004–0.006 (Andersson et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"To conclude, strong individual volcanic eruptions cause multi-annual variations in radiative forcing. However, the average magnitude and variability of SAOD and its associated volcanic aerosol forcing since 1900 are not unusual in the context of at least the past 2.5 kyr (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3_p1,2.2.3.1 CO,"Well-mixed greenhouse gases generally have lifetimes of more than several years. The AR5 assigned medium confidence to the values of atmospheric CO2 concentrations (mixing ratios) during the warm geological periods of the early Eocene and Pliocene. It concluded with very high confidence that, by 2011, the mixing ratios of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the atmosphere exceeded the range derived from ice cores for the previous 800 kyr, and that the observed rates of increase of the greenhouse gases were unprecedented on centennial timescales over at least the past 22 kyr. It reported that over 2005–2011 atmospheric burdens of CO2, CH4, and N2O increased, with 2011 levels of 390.5 parts per million (ppm), 1803.2 parts per billion (ppb) and 324.2 ppb, respectively. Increases of CO2 and N2O over 2005–2011 were comparable to those over 1996–2005, while CH4 resumed increasing in 2007, after remaining nearly constant over 1999–2006. A comprehensive process-based assessment of changes in CO2, CH4, and N2O is undertaken in Chapter 5."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Isotopes from continental and marine sediments using improved analytical techniques and sampling resolution have reinforced the understanding of long-term changes in atmospheric CO2 during the past 450 Myr (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.3). In particular, for the last 60 Myr, sampling resolution and accuracy of the boron isotope proxy in ocean sediments has improved (Penman et al., 2014; Anagnostou et al., 2016, 2020; Chalk et al., 2017; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018; Dyez et al., 2018; Raitzsch et al., 2018; Sosdian et al., 2018; Henehan et al., 2019, 2020; de la Vega et al., 2020; Harper et al., 2020), the understanding of the alkenone CO2 proxy has increased (e.g., Badger et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019; Y. Zhang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021) and new phytoplankton proxies have been developed and applied (e.g., Witkowski et al., 2018). Understanding of the boron isotope CO2 proxy has improved since AR5 with studies showing very good agreement between boron-CO2 estimates and co-existing ice core CO2 (Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Foster, 2008; Henehan et al., 2013; Chalk et al., 2017; Raitzsch et al., 2018; see Figure 2.3c). Such independent validation has proven difficult to achieve with the other available CO2 proxies (e.g., Badger et al., 2019; Da et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019; Y. Zhang et al., 2019). Remaining uncertainties in these ocean sediment based proxies (Hollis et al., 2019) partly limit the applicability of the alkenoneδ13C and boronδ11B proxies beyond the Cenozoic, although new records are emerging, for example, Jurikova et al. (2020). CO2 estimates from the terrestrial CO2 proxies, such as stomatal density in fossil plants and δ13C of palaeosol carbonates, are available for much of the last 420 Myr. Given the low sampling density, relatively large CO2 uncertainty, and high age uncertainty (relative to marine sediments) of the terrestrial proxies, preference here is given to the marine based proxies (and boron in particular) where possible."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Levels were close to 1750 values during at least one prolonged interval during the Carboniferous and Permian (350–252 Ma). During the Triassic (251.9–201.3 Ma), atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios reached a maximum of between 2000–5000 ppm (200–220 Ma). During the PETM (56 Ma) CO2 rapidly rose from about 900 ppm to about 2000 ppm (Table 2.1; Schubert and Jahren, 2013; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Anagnostou et al., 2020) in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Turner, 2018). Estimated multi-millennial rates of CO2 accumulation during this event range from 0.3–1.5 PgC yr–1 (Gingerich, 2019), at least 4–5 times lower than current centennial rates (Section 5.3.1.1). Based on boron and carbon isotope data, supported by other proxies (Hollis et al., 2019), atmospheric CO2 during the EECO (50 Ma) was between 1150 and 2500 ppm (medium confidence), and then gradually declined over the last 50 Myr at a long-term rate of about 16 ppm Myr–1 (Figure 2.3). The last time the CO2 mixing ratio was as high as 1000 ppm (the level reached by some high emissions scenarios by 2100; Annex III) was prior to the Eocene-Oligocene transition (33.5 Ma; Figure 2.3) that was associated with the first major advance of the AIS (Pearson et al., 2009; Pagani et al., 2011; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Witkowski et al., 2018; Hollis et al., 2019). The compilation of Foster et al. (2017) constrained CO2 concentration to between 290 and 450 ppm during the MPWP, based primarily on the boron-isotope data reported by Martínez-Botí et al. (2015b), consistent with the AR5 range of 300–450 ppm. A more recent high-resolution boron isotope-based study revealed that CO2 cycled during the MPWP from about 330 to about 390 ppm on orbital timescales, with a mean of about 370 ppm (de la Vega et al., 2020). Although data from other proxy types (e.g., stomatal density orδ13C of alkenones) have too low resolution to resolve the orbital-related variability of CO2 during this interval (e.g., Kürschner et al., 1996; Stoll et al., 2019) there is general agreement among the different proxy types with the boron-derived mean (e.g., Stoll et al., 2019). High-resolution sampling (about 1 sample per 3 kyr) with the boron-isotope proxy indicates mean CO2 mixing ratios for the Marine Isotope Stage KM5c interglacial were 360–420 ppm (medium confidence) (de la Vega et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Following the MPWP, the atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio generally decreased at a rate of about 30 ppm Myr–1.

Related to the shift of glacial-interglacial cycle frequency from 40 to 100 kyr at 0.8–1.2 Ma, there was a decrease of glacial-period CO2 (Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018). These boron isotope-based CO2 results agree with available records based on ancient ice exposed near the surface of the AIS (Yan et al., 2019), however, direct comparison is limited due to a lack of ancient ice cores with sufficiently continuous stratigraphy (Higgins et al., 2015; Brook and Buizert, 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"To conclude, there is  high confidence that average EECO and MPWP (KM5c) CO2 concentrations were higher than those preceding industrialization at 1150–2500 ppm and 360–420 ppm, respectively.

Although these rates are an order of magnitude lower than those directly observed over 1919–2019 CE (Section 2.2.3.3.1), they provide information on non-linear responses of climate-biogeochemical feedbacks (Section 5.1.2). Multiple records for 0–1850 CE show CO2 mixing ratios of 274–285 ppm. Offsets among ice core records are about 1%, but the long-term trends agree well and show coherent multi-centennial variations of about 10 ppm (Ahn et al., 2012; Bauska et al., 2015; Rubino et al., 2019).

CO2 concentration increased by 5.0 ± 0.8 ppm during 970–1130 CE, followed by a decrease of 4.6 ± 1.7 ppm during 1580–1700 CE. The greatest rate of change over the CE prior to 1750 is observed at about 1600 CE, and ranges from –6.9 to +4.7 ppm per century in multiple high-resolution ice core records (Siegenthaler et al., 2005; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ahn et al., 2012; Bauska et al., 2015; Rubino et al., 2019). Although ice core records present low-pass filtered time series due to gas diffusion and gradual bubble close-off in the snow layer over the ice sheet (Fourteau et al., 2020), the rate of increase since 1850 CE (about 125 ppm increase over about 170 years) is far greater than implied for any 170-year period by ice core records that cover the last 800 ka (very high confidence)."

On millennial timescales, most rapid climate changes observed in Greenland and other regions are coincident with rapid CH4 changes (Buizert et al., 2015; Rhodes et al., 2015, 2017). The variability of CH4 on centennial timescales during the early Holocene does not significantly differ from that of the late Holocene prior to about 1850 (Rhodes et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2017). The LGM concentration was 390.5 ± 6.0 ppb (Kageyama et al., 2017). The global mean concentrations during 0–1850 CE varied between 625 and 807 ppb. High-resolution ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland exhibit the same trends with an inter-polar difference of 36–47 ppb (Sapart et al., 2012; L. Mitchell et al., 2013). There is a long-term positive trend of about 0.5 ppb per decade during the CE until 1750 CE. The most rapid CH4 changes prior to industrialization were as large as 30–50 ppb on multi-decadal timescales.

Zhang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021) and new phytoplankton proxies have been developed and applied (e.g., Witkowski et al., 2018). Understanding of the boron isotope CO2 proxy has improved since AR5 with studies showing very good agreement between boron-CO2 estimates and co-existing ice core CO2 (Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Foster, 2008; Henehan et al., 2013; Chalk et al., 2017; Raitzsch et al., 2018; see Figure 2.3c). Such independent validation has proven difficult to achieve with the other available CO2 proxies (e.g., Badger et al., 2019; Da et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019; Y. Zhang et al., 2019). Remaining uncertainties in these ocean sediment based proxies (Hollis et al., 2019) partly limit the applicability of the alkenoneδ13C and boronδ11B proxies beyond the Cenozoic, although new records are emerging, for example, Jurikova et al. (2020). CO2 estimates from the terrestrial CO2 proxies, such as stomatal density in fossil plants and δ13C of palaeosol carbonates, are available for much of the last 420 Myr. Given the low sampling density, relatively large CO2 uncertainty, and high age uncertainty (relative to marine sediments) of the terrestrial proxies, preference here is given to the marine based proxies (and boron in particular) where possible."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Levels were close to 1750 values during at least one prolonged interval during the Carboniferous and Permian (350–252 Ma). During the Triassic (251.9–201.3 Ma), atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios reached a maximum of between 2000–5000 ppm (200–220 Ma). During the PETM (56 Ma) CO2 rapidly rose from about 900 ppm to about 2000 ppm (Table 2.1; Schubert and Jahren, 2013; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Anagnostou et al., 2020) in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Turner, 2018). Estimated multi-millennial rates of CO2 accumulation during this event range from 0.3–1.5 PgC yr–1 (Gingerich, 2019), at least 4–5 times lower than current centennial rates (Section 5.3.1.1). Based on boron and carbon isotope data, supported by other proxies (Hollis et al., 2019), atmospheric CO2 during the EECO (50 Ma) was between 1150 and 2500 ppm (medium confidence), and then gradually declined over the last 50 Myr at a long-term rate of about 16 ppm Myr–1 (Figure 2.3). The last time the CO2 mixing ratio was as high as 1000 ppm (the level reached by some high emissions scenarios by 2100; Annex III) was prior to the Eocene-Oligocene transition (33.5 Ma; Figure 2.3) that was associated with the first major advance of the AIS (Pearson et al., 2009; Pagani et al., 2011; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Witkowski et al., 2018; Hollis et al., 2019). The compilation of Foster et al. (2017) constrained CO2 concentration to between 290 and 450 ppm during the MPWP, based primarily on the boron-isotope data reported by Martínez-Botí et al. (2015b), consistent with the AR5 range of 300–450 ppm. A more recent high-resolution boron isotope-based study revealed that CO2 cycled during the MPWP from about 330 to about 390 ppm on orbital timescales, with a mean of about 370 ppm (de la Vega et al., 2020). Although data from other proxy types (e.g., stomatal density orδ13C of alkenones) have too low resolution to resolve the orbital-related variability of CO2 during this interval (e.g., Kürschner et al., 1996; Stoll et al., 2019) there is general agreement among the different proxy types with the boron-derived mean (e.g., Stoll et al., 2019). High-resolution sampling (about 1 sample per 3 kyr) with the boron-isotope proxy indicates mean CO2 mixing ratios for the Marine Isotope Stage KM5c interglacial were 360–420 ppm (medium confidence) (de la Vega et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Following the MPWP, the atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio generally decreased at a rate of about 30 ppm Myr–1.

Related to the shift of glacial-interglacial cycle frequency from 40 to 100 kyr at 0.8–1.2 Ma, there was a decrease of glacial-period CO2 (Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018). These boron isotope-based CO2 results agree with available records based on ancient ice exposed near the surface of the AIS (Yan et al., 2019), however, direct comparison is limited due to a lack of ancient ice cores with sufficiently continuous stratigraphy (Higgins et al., 2015; Brook and Buizert, 2018)."

Wang et al., 2016), can significantly influence SWV abundance and the tropical cold point tropopause temperatures that largely control water vapour entering the stratosphere. It has also been shown that the convective lofting of ice can moisten the lower stratosphere over large regions (Dessler et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2017; Avery et al., 2017). Near-global observations of SWV have revealed unusually strong and abrupt interannual changes, especially in the tropical lower stratosphere. Between December 2015 and November 2016, the tropical mean SWV anomaly at 82 hPa dropped from 0.9 ± 0.1 ppm to –1.0 ± 0.1 ppm, accompanied by highly anomalous QBO-related dynamics in the tropical stratosphere (P.A. Newman et al., 2016; Tweedy et al., 2017) and the transition of ENSO from strong El Niño to La Niña conditions (Davis et al., 2017).

At southern and northern mid-latitudes, declines are 5.5% and 3.0% compared to the 1964–1980 average respectively. Total ozone remained practically unchanged in the tropics (Braesicke et al., 2018). Emission of ODS started before 1980 and some estimates suggest that as much as 40% of the long-term ozone loss occurred between 1960 and 1980 (Shepherd et al., 2014), lowering the 1964–1980 baseline values by about 1% (outside the polar regions), a value close to observational uncertainties.

Large ozone depletions continue to appear in spring in the Antarctic and, in particularly cold years, also in the Arctic. Model-based estimates disagree on the sign of the ERF due to stratospheric ozone changes, but agree that it is much smaller in magnitude than that due to tropospheric ozone changes (Section 7.3.2.5)."

Surface ozone likely  increased in East Asia, but levelled off or decreased in the eastern USA and western Europe. Free tropospheric trends (1971–2010) from ozonesondes and aircraft showed positive trends in most, but not all, assessed regions, and for most seasons and altitudes.

wg1_ch02_2.2.5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Prior to 1850 ozone observations do not exist, but a recent analysis using clumped-isotope composition of molecular oxygen (18O18O in O2) trapped in polar firn and ice, combined with atmospheric chemistry model simulations, constrains the global tropospheric ozone increase to less than 40% between 1850 and 2005, with most of this increase occurring between 1950 and 1980 (Yeung et al., 2019). Recently, the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report identified and evaluated 60 records of surface ozone observations collected at rural locations worldwide between 1896 and 1975, which were based on a range of measurement techniques with potentially large uncertainties (Tarasick et al., 2019). They found that from the mid-20th century (1930s to the early 1970s) to 1990–2014, rural surface ozone increased by 30–70% across the northern extra-tropics. This is smaller than the 100% 20th-century increase reported in AR5, which relied on far fewer measurement sites, all in Europe. In the northern tropics limited low-elevation historical data (1954–1975) provide no clear indication of surface ozone increases (Tarasick et al., 2019). However, similar to the northern mid-latitude increases, lower-free tropospheric ozone at Mauna Loa, Hawaii increased by approximately 50% from the late 1950s to present (Cooper et al., 2020). Historical observations are too limited to draw conclusions on surface ozone trends in the SH tropics and mid-latitudes since the mid-20th century, with tropospheric ozone exhibiting little change across Antarctica (Tarasick et al., 2019; Cooper et al., 2020). Based on reliable UV absorption measurements at remote locations (surface and lower troposphere), ozone trends since the mid-1990s varied spatially at northern mid-latitudes, but increased in the northern tropics (2–17%; 1–6 ppbv per decade; (Cooper et al., 2020; Gaudel et al., 2020). Across the SH these more recent observations are too limited to determine zonal trends (e.g., tropics, mid-latitudes, high latitudes)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.5.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The earliest observations of free tropospheric ozone (1934–1955) are available from northern mid-latitudes where limited data indicate a tropospheric column ozone increase of 48 ± 30% up to 1990–2012 (Tarasick et al., 2019). Starting in the 1960s, records from ozonesondes show no significant changes in the free troposphere over the Arctic and mid-latitude regions of Canada, but trends are mainly positive elsewhere in the northern mid-latitudes (Oltmans et al., 2013; Cooper et al., 2020). Tropospheric column and free tropospheric trends since the mid-1990s based on commercial aircraft, ozonesonde observations and satellite retrievals (Figure 2.8b,c), are overwhelmingly positive across the northern mid-latitudes (2–7%; 1–4 ppbv per decade) and tropics (2–14%; 1–5 ppbv per decade), with the largest increases (8–14%; 3–6 ppbv per decade) in the northern tropics in the vicinity of southern Asia and Indonesia. Observations in the SH are limited, but indicate average tropospheric column ozone increases of 2–12% (1–5 ppbv) per decade in the tropics (Figure 2.8c), and weak tropospheric column ozone increases (<5%, <1 ppbv per decade) at mid-latitudes (Cooper et al., 2020). Above Antarctica, mid-tropospheric ozone has increased since the late 20th century (Oltmans et al., 2013). The total ozone ERF from 1750 to 2019 best estimate is assessed as 0.47 W m–2 (Section 7.3.2.5) and this is dominated by increases in the troposphere. The underlying modelled global tropospheric ozone column increase (Skeie et al., 2020) from 1850 to 2010 of 40–60%, is somewhat higher than the isotope based upper-limit of Yeung et al. (2019). At mid-latitudes (30°–60°N) model increases of 30–40% since the mid-20th century are broadly consistent with observations."

Surface/low altitude ozone trends since the mid-1990s are variable at northern mid-latitudes, but positive in the tropics [2 to 17% per decade] (high confidence). Since the mid-1990s, free tropospheric ozone has increased by 2–7% per decade in most regions of the northern mid-latitudes, and 2–12% per decade in the sampled regions of the northern and southern tropics (high confidence).

The ERF associated with aerosol–radiation interactions for 2011 (relative to 1750) was estimated to be –0.45 ± 0.5 W m–2 and of aerosol–cloud interaction estimated as –0.45 [–1.2 to 0.0] W m–2.

Estimates of the glacial/interglacial ratio in global dust deposition are within the range of 2–4 (Albani et al., 2015; Lambert et al., 2015). New reconstructions indicate a ratio of 3–5 for the glacial/interglacial loadings for mid- and high-latitude ocean of both hemispheres (Lamy et al., 2014; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014; Serno et al., 2015). Improved quantification of changes in dust deposition from North Africa and North Atlantic sediment records confirms dust deposition rates lower by a factor 2–5 during the African Humid Period (10–5 ka) compared to the late Holocene (McGee et al., 2013; Albani et al., 2015; Middleton et al., 2018; Palchan and Torfstein, 2019).

Over southern Asia, however, AOD from satellite (MODIS/MISR) and AERONET retrievals show continuing increases (Li et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2017), with similar trends from UV-based aerosol retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite (Dahutia et al., 2018; Hammer et al., 2018). A comparison of MODIS and MISR radiometric observations with the broadband CERES satellite instrument (Corbett and Loeb, 2015) showed that drifts in calibration are unlikely  to affect the satellite derived trends. CERES shows patterns for clear-sky broadband radiation consistent with the aerosol spatio-temporal changes (Loeb et al., 2018; Paulot et al., 2018)."

Satellite data and ground-based records indicate that AOD exhibits predominantly negative trends since 2000 over NH mid-latitudes and SH continents, but increased over South Asia and East Africa (high confidence).

wg1_ch02_2.2.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Much of the global land surface has been modified or managed to some extent by human activities during the Holocene. Reconstructions based on pollen data indicate that natural vegetation probably covered most of the Earth’s ice-free terrestrial surface until roughly the mid-Holocene (Marquer et al., 2017; Harrison et al., 2020; F. Li et al., 2020). Reconstructions based on pollen, archaeological, and historical data indicate deforestation at the regional scale since at least 6 ka (Marquer et al., 2017; Stephens et al., 2019; Harrison et al., 2020; F. Li et al., 2020). From a global perspective, land-use forcing datasets (Lawrence et al., 2016) estimate that changes in land use (and related deforestation) were small on the global scale until the mid-19th century and accelerated markedly thereafter, with larger uncertainties prior to industrialization (Kaplan et al., 2017). Since the early 1980s, about 60% of all land cover changes have been associated with direct human activities, with spatial patterns emphasizing the regional character of land use and land management, including tropical deforestation, temperate afforestation, cropland intensification, and increased urbanization (Song et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018). At present, nearly three-quarters of the ice-free terrestrial surface is under some form of human use (Venter et al., 2016; Erb et al., 2017), particularly in agriculture and forest management."
wg1_ch02_2.2.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"The impact of historical land-cover change on global climate is assessed with model simulations that consider multiple climate and biophysical processes (e.g., changes in albedo, evapotranspiration, and roughness) and/or biogeochemical processes (e.g., changes in atmospheric composition such as carbon release from deforestation). The dominant biophysical response to land cover changes is albedo, which is estimated (using a MODIS albedo product and a historical land-use harmonization product) to have increased gradually prior to the mid-19th century and then strongly through the mid-20th century, with a slightly slower rise thereafter (Ghimire et al., 2014). Recent radiative forcing estimates arising from biophysical processes generally fall at the lower end of the AR5 assessed range. For instance, based on historical simulations from 13 CMIP6 models, C.J. Smith et al. (2020) estimated that the ERF from surface albedo changes (including snow cover and leaf area) was –0.08 [–0.22 to +0.06] W m–2 since 1850. Similarly, based on simulations from 13 CMIP5 models, Lejeune et al. (2020) estimated the radiative forcing from transitions between trees, crops, and grasslands was –0.11 [–0.16 to +0.04] W m–2 since 1860. Andrews et al. (2017) identified an ERF of –0.40 W m–2 since 1860, ascribing much of the effect to increases in albedo (including the unmasking of underlying snow cover); notably, however, the analysis was based on a single model with a known tendency to overestimate the ERF (Collins et al., 2011). Ward et al. (2014) examined the combined effects of biophysical and biogeochemical processes, obtaining an RF of 0.9 ± 0.5 W m–2 since 1850 that was driven primarily by increases in land-use related GHG emissions from deforestation and agriculture (Ward and Mahowald, 2015). According to a large suite of historical simulations, the biophysical effects of changes in land cover (i.e., increased surface albedo and decreased turbulent heat fluxes) led to a net global cooling of 0.10°C ± 0.14°C at the surface (SRCCL). Available model simulations suggest that biophysical and biogeochemical effects jointly may have contributed to a small global warming of 0.078°C ± 0.093°C at the surface over about the past two centuries (SRCCL), with a potentially even larger warming contribution over the Holocene as a whole (He et al., 2014)."
wg1_ch02_2.2.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"In summary, biophysical effects from historical changes in land use have an overall negative ERF (medium confidence).

Strong volcanic eruptions (Section 2.2.2) with periods of strong negative ERF lasting 2–5 years in duration occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There followed a relatively quiescent period between about 1920 and 1960, and then three strong eruptions in 1963, 1982 and 1991, and only small-to-moderate eruptions thereafter (Schmidt et al., 2018)."

Mixing ratios of the most abundant CFCs declined (Section 2.2.4). Mixing ratios of HCFCs increased, but growth rates are starting to decelerate. Mixing ratios of HFCs and some other human-made components are increasing (Section 2.2.4).

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This assessment of the paleo reference periods (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1) draws from studies based mostly or entirely on indirect observational evidence from geological archives (i.e., proxy records) rather than reconstructions that rely more heavily on modelled parameters and those based on deep-ocean temperatures (e.g., Köhler et al., 2015; Friedrich et al., 2016). In contrast to AR5, temperature estimates from climate models are not included in the assessed values for paleo reference periods in this chapter. The AR5 concluded that the reconstructed GMST during the PETM was 4°C–7°C warmer than pre-PETM mean climate (low confidence), and that the EECO and the MPWP were 9°C–14°C and 1.9°C–3.6°C warmer than pre-industrial, respectively (medium confidence). The GMST during the LIG was assessed at 1°C–2°C warmer than pre-industrial (medium confidence), whereas SROCC narrowed the range to 0.5°C–1.0°C warmer, but did not state a confidence level. The AR5 further concluded that it was very likely  that the LGM was 3°C–8°C colder than pre-industrial, and likely  that the maximum rate of global warming during the subsequent deglacial period was 1°C–1.5°C kyr–1."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"For the PETM, new reconstructions agree with those assessed by AR5. A major new compilation of proxy temperature data (Hollis et al., 2019) analysed using multiple statistical approaches (Inglis et al., 2020) indicates that GMST was 10°C–25°C (90% range) warmer than 1850–1900, or about 5°C warmer relative to the pre-PETM state. A related synthesis study also estimates that PETM warmed by 5°C (no uncertainty assigned; Zhu et al., 2019). A recent benthic isotope compilation (Westerhold et al., 2020) transformed to GMST based on the formulation by J. Hansen et al. (2013; Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1), and adjusted to 1850–1900 by adding 0.36°C, shows an increase of GMST by about 10°C during the PETM. This reflects the expected higher variability at single sites that were used to splice together the composite time series, compared to the globally averaged composite time series of Zachos et al. (2008). The latter was originally used by J. Hansen et al. (2013) to reconstruct GMST, and is the preferred representation of the global average bottom water conditions, despite its less well-refined chronology."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"For the EECO, new GMST reconstructions fall at the high end of the range assessed by AR5. These include estimates of 7°C–18°C (90% range; Inglis et al., 2020) and 12°C–18°C (95% range; Zhu et al., 2019) warmer than 1850–1900, and 10°C–16°C warmer than 1995–2014 ‘recent past’ conditions (2 standard error range; Caballero and Huber, 2013). Together, they indicate that GMST was 10°C–18°C warmer during the EECO compared with 1850–1900 (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 did not assess the GMST for the MCO. Reconstructions based on data from multiple study sites include estimates of about 4°C (uncertainty range not specified; You et al., 2009) and 5°C–10°C (2 standard error range; Goldner et al., 2014) warmer than 1850–1900. Together, these studies indicate that GMST was 4°C–10°C warmer during the MCO (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"For the MPWP, new proxy-based estimates of global sea surface temperatures (SST) are about 2.0°C–3.5°C warmer than 1850–1900, depending on which proxy types are included in the analysis (Foley and Dowsett, 2019; McClymont et al., 2020). On the basis of model-derived relationships between land versus sea surface temperatures under different climate states (Figure 3.2b), the increase in GMST is estimated to have been roughly 15% greater than the increase in global SST. Therefore, GMST during the MPWP is estimated to have been 2.5°C–4.0°C warmer than 1850–1900 (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"For the LIG (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1, and Figure 2.11), a major new compilation of marine proxy data (Turney et al., 2020) from 203 sites indicates that the average SST from 129–125 ka was 1.0°C ± 0.2°C (2 SD) warmer than 1850–1900 (reported relative to 1981–2010 and adjusted here by 0.8°C). These temperatures represent the time of peak warmth, which may not have been synchronous among these sites. This compares with two other SST estimates for 125 ka of 0.5°C ± 0.3°C (± 2 SD) warmer at 125 ka relative to 1870–1889 (Hoffman et al., 2017), and about 1.4°C (no uncertainty stated) warmer at 125 ka relative to 1850–1900 (Friedrich and Timmermann, 2020; reported relative to 10–5 ka and adjusted here by 0.4°C; Kaufman et al., 2020a). The average of these post-AR5 global SST anomalies is 1°C. Commensurately (Figure 3.2b), GMST is estimated to have been roughly 1.1°C above 1850–1900 values, although this value could be too high if peak warmth was not globally synchronous (Capron et al., 2017). A further estimate of peak GMST anomalies of 1.0°C–3.5°C (90% range; adjusted here to 1850–1900 by adding 0.2°C) based on 59 marine sediment cores (Snyder, 2016) is considerably warmer than remaining estimates and is therefore given less weight in the final assessment. The warmest millennium of the LIG GMST reconstruction in J. Hansen et al. (2013) is 1.5°C above 1850–1900. In summary, GMST during the warmest millennia of the LIG (within the interval of around 129–125 ka) is estimated to have reached 0.5°C–1.5°C higher values than the 1850–1990 reference period (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"New GMST reconstructions for the LGM fall near the middle of AR5’s very likely range, which was based on a combination of proxy reconstructions and model simulations. Two of these new reconstructions use marine proxies to reconstruct global SST that were scaled to GMST based on different assumptions. One indicates that GMST was 6.2 [4.5 to 8.1] °C cooler than the late Holocene average (Snyder, 2016), and the other, 5.7°C ± 0.8°C (2 SD) cooler than the average of the first part of the Holocene (10–5 ka) (Friedrich and Timmermann, 2020). A third new estimate (Tierney et al., 2020) uses a much larger compilation of marine proxies along with a data-assimilation procedure, rather than scaling, to reconstruct a GMST of 6.1°C ± 0.4°C (2 SD) cooler than the late Holocene. Assuming that the 1850–1900 reference period was 0.2°C and 0.4°C cooler than the late and first part of the Holocene, respectively (Kaufman et al., 2020a), the midpoints of these three new GMST reconstructions average –5.8°C relative to 1850–1900. The coldest multi-century period of the LGM in the J. Hansen et al. (2013) reconstruction is 4.3°C colder than 1850–1900. This compares to land- and SST-only estimates of about –6.1°C ± 2°C and –2.2°C ± 1°C, respectively (2 SD), which are based on AR5-generation studies that imply a warmer GMST than more recent reconstructions (Figure 1c in Harrison et al., 2015; Figure 7 in Harrison et al., 2016). A major new pollen-based data-assimilation reconstruction averages 6.9°C cooler over northern extratropical land (Cleator et al., 2020). LGM temperature variability on centennial scales was about four times higher globally than during the Holocene, and even greater at high latitudes (Rehfeld et al., 2018). In summary, GMST is estimated to have been 5°C–7°C lower during the LGM (around 23–19 ka) compared with 1850–1900 (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"For the LDT (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1), no new large-scale studies have been published since AR5 (Shakun et al., 2012) to further assess the rate of GMST change during this period of rapid global warming (estimated at 1°C–1.5°C per kyr). The reconstruction of Shakun et al. (2012) was based primarily on SST records and therefore underrepresents the change in GMST during the LDT. Temperature over Greenland increased by about ten times that rate during the centuries of most rapid warming (Jansen et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 did not include an assessment of large-scale temperature estimates for the MH, although it assigned  high confidence to the long-term cooling trend over mid- to high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the 5 kyr that preceded recent warming. For average annual NH temperatures, the period 1983–2012 was assessed as very likely  the warmest 30-year period of the past 800 years (high confidence) and likely  the warmest 30-year period of the past 1.4 kyr (medium confidence); the warm multi-decadal periods prior to the 20th century were unsynchronized across regions, in contrast to the warming since the mid-20th century (high confidence), although only sparse information was available from the SH."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"This section concerns the Holocene period prior to industrialization when GMST was overall highest. Whereas SR1.5 focussed upon the ‘Holocene thermal maximum’ when regional temperatures were up to 1°C higher than 1850–1900, though peak warming occurred regionally at different times between around 10 and 5 ka greatly complicating interpretation. A multi-method reconstruction (Kaufman et al., 2020a) based on a quality-controlled, multi-proxy synthesis of paleo-temperature records from 470 terrestrial and 209 marine sites globally (Kaufman et al., 2020b) indicates that the median GMST of the warmest two-century-long interval was 0.7 [0.3 to 1.8] °C warmer than 1800–1900 (which averaged 0.03°C colder than 1850–1900; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019), and was centred around 6.5 ka. This is similar to Marcott et al. (2013), which is based on a smaller dataset (73 sites) and different procedures to estimate a maximum warmth of 0.8°C ± 0.3°C (2 SD) at around 7.0 ka, adjusted here by adding 0.3°C to account for differences in reference periods. These may be underestimates because averaging inherently smoothed proxy records with uncertain chronologies reduces the variability in the temperature reconstruction (e.g., Dolman and Laepple, (2018) for sedimentary archives). However, the general coincidence between peak warmth and astronomically driven boreal summer insolation might reflect a bias toward summer conditions (Liu et al., 2014; Hou et al., 2019; Bova et al., 2021), suggesting that the estimate is too high. This possibility is supported by AR5-generation proxy data focusing on 6 ka (Harrison et al., 2014), the long-standing MH modelling target (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1), that indicate surface temperatures for land and ocean were indistinguishable from ‘pre-industrial’ climate (Figure 1c in Harrison et al., 2015; Figure 7 in Harrison et al., 2016). In contrast, the GMST estimate from the multi-method global reconstruction (Kaufman et al., 2020a) for the millennium centred on 6 ka is only about 0.1°C colder than the warmest millennium."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Taking all lines of evidence into account, the GMST averaged over the warmest centuries of the current interglacial period (sometime between around 6 and 7 ka) is estimated to have been 0.2°C–1.0°C higher than 1850–1900 (medium confidence). It is therefore more likely than not  that no multi-centennial interval during the post-glacial period was warmer globally than the most recent decade (which was 1.1°C warmer than 1850–1900; Section 2.3.1.1.3); the LIG (129–116 ka) is the next most recent candidate for a period of higher global temperature. Zonally averaged mean annual temperature reconstructions (Routson et al., 2019) indicate that MH warmth was most pronounced north of 30°N latitude, and that GMST subsequently decreased in general, albeit with multi-century variability, with greater cooling in the NH than in the SH (Kaufman et al., 2020a)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The temperature history of the last millennium and the methods used to reconstruct it have been studied extensively, both prior to and following AR5, as summarized recently by Smerdon and Pollack (2016) and Christiansen and Ljungqvist (2017). New regional (e.g., Shi et al., 2015; Stenni et al., 2017; Werner et al., 2018), global ocean (McGregor et al., 2015), quasi-hemispheric (Neukom et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2015; Anchukaitis et al., 2017), and global (Tardif et al., 2019) temperature reconstructions, and new regional proxy data syntheses (Lüning et al., 2019a, b) have been published, extending back 1–2 kyr. In addition, a major new global compilation of multiproxy, annually resolved paleo-temperature records for the CE (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2017) has been analysed using a variety of statistical methods for reconstructing temperature (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). The median of the multi-method GMST reconstruction from this synthesis (Figure 2.11a) generally agrees with the AR5 assessment, while affording more robust estimates of the following major features of GMST during the CE: (i) an overall millennial-scale cooling trend of –0.18 [–0.28 to 0.00] °C kyr–1 prior to 1850; (ii) a multi-centennial period of relatively low temperature beginning around the 15th century, with GMST averaging –0.03 [–0.30 to 0.06] °C between 1450 and 1850 relative to 1850–1900; (iii) the warmest multi-decadal period occurring most recently; and (iv) the rate of warming during the second half of the 20th century (from instrumental data) exceeding the 99th percentile of all 51-year trends over the past 2 kyr. Moreover, the new proxy data compilation shows that the warming of the 20th century was more spatially uniform than any other century-scale temperature change of the CE (medium confidence) (Neukom et al., 2019). A new independent temperature reconstruction extending back to 1580 is based on an expanded database of subsurface borehole temperature profiles, along with refined methods for inverse modelling (Cuesta-Valero et al., 2021). The borehole data, converted to GMST based on the modelled relation between changes in land versus sea surface temperature outlined previously, indicate that average GMST for 1600–1650 was 0.12°C colder than 1850–1900, which is similar to the PAGES 2k reconstruction (0.09°C colder), although both estimates are associated with relatively large uncertainties (0.8°C (95% range) and 0.5°C (90% range), respectively)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"To conclude, following approximately 6 ka, GMST generally decreased, culminating in the coldest multi-century interval of the post-glacial period (since 8 ka), which occurred between around 1450 and 1850 (high confidence). This multi-millennial cooling trend was reversed in the mid-19th century. Since around 1950, GMST has increased at an observed rate unprecedented for any 50-year period in at least the last 2000 years (high confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 concluded that it was certain that GMST had increased since the late 19th century. Total warming in GMST was assessed as 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C over 1880–2012, while the change from 1850–1900 to 2003–2012 was assessed at 0.78 [0.72 to 0.85] °C, and from 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 at 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C. The SR1.5 reported warming of GMST from 1850–1900 to 2006–2015 of 0.87°C, with an 1880–2012 trend of 0.86°C and an 1880–2015 trend of 0.92°C. The SRCCL concluded that since the pre-industrial period, surface air temperature over land areas has risen nearly twice as much as the global mean surface temperature (high confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there have been substantial improvements in the availability of instrumental archive data both over the ocean and on land. A new version of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS Release 3.0, Freeman et al., 2017) comprises over 450 million in situ marine reports and incorporates newly digitized data, increasing coverage in data sparse regions and times (e.g., polar oceans and World War I). The International Surface Temperature Initiative released a much improved collection of fundamental land surface air temperature records (Rennie et al., 2014) comprising more than 35,000 station records. These advances, both of which have substantially improved spatial coverage, have reduced uncertainties in assessments of both land and marine data."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"For SST analyses, three products – HadSST4 (1850–present, Kennedy et al., 2019), ERSSTv5 (1850–present, Huang et al., 2017) and COBE SST2 (1880–present, (Hirahara et al., 2014) – now have bias adjustments applied throughout the record. The new SST datasets account for two major issues previously identified in AR5: that globally averaged buoy SSTs are about 0.12°C cooler than ship-based SSTs (Kennedy et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015), and that SSTs from ship engine room intakes may have biases for individual ships depending upon the sensor set-up (Kent and Kaplan, 2006) but have an overall warm bias when globally aggregated (Kennedy et al., 2019). The first issue primarily affects data since 1990, when buoys began to increasingly contribute to the observation network (Woodruff et al., 2011), and the second issue has its largest effect from the 1940s to the 1970s. From the standpoint of uncertainty, ERSSTv4 (W. Liu et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016) and subsequent versions (Huang et al., 2017), and HadSST4 have estimates presented as ensembles that sample parametric uncertainty. Comparisons between these independently-derived analyses and the assessed uncertainties (Kennedy, 2014; Kent et al., 2017) show unambiguously that global mean SST increased since the start of the 20th century, a conclusion that is insensitive to the method used to treat gaps in data coverage (Kennedy, 2014)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"A number of recent studies also corroborate important components of the SST record (Hausfather et al., 2017; Kent et al., 2017; Cowtan et al., 2018; Kennedy et al., 2019). In particular, ATSR SST satellite retrievals (Merchant et al., 2012; Berry et al., 2018), the near-surface records from hydrographical profiles (Gouretski et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2018), and coastal observations (Cowtan et al., 2018) have all been shown to be broadly consistent with the homogenized SST analyses. Hausfather et al. (2017) also confirmed the new estimate of the rate of warming seen in ERSSTv4 since the late 1990s through comparison with independent SST data sources such as Argo floats and satellite retrievals. Nevertheless, dataset differences remain in the mid-20th century when there were major, poorly-documented, changes in instrumentation and observational practices (Kent et al., 2017), particularly during World War II, when ship observations were limited and disproportionately originated from US naval sources (Thompson et al., 2008). Kennedy et al. (2019) also identify differences between the new HadSST4 dataset and other SST datasets in the 1980s and 1990s, indicating that some level of structural uncertainty remains during this period, whilst Chan et al. (2019) and Davis et al. (2019) document residual uncertainties in the early and later 20th century records respectively."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Historically, SST has been used as a basis for global temperature assessment on the premise that the less variable SST data provides a better estimate of marine temperature changes than marine air temperature (MAT) (Kent and Kennedy, 2021). However, MAT products are used to adjust SST biases in the NOAA SST product because they are assessed to be more homogeneous (Huang et al., 2017). Observational datasets exist for night-marine air temperature (NMAT) (e.g., Cornes et al., 2020; Junod and Christy, 2020; Rayner et al., 2020) and there are methods to adjust daytime MATs (Berry et al., 2004), but there is to date no regularly updated dataset which combines MAT with temperatures over land. MAT datasets are more sparse in recent decades than SST datasets as marine datasets have become increasingly dependent on drifting buoys (Centurioni et al., 2019) which generally measure SST but not MAT, and there are almost no recent winter MAT data south of 40°S (Swart et al., 2019). However, the situation reverses in the 19th century with a greater prevalence of MAT than SST measurements available in the ICOADS data repository (Freeman et al., 2017, 2019; Kent and Kennedy, 2021)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"The GHCNMv4 dataset (Menne et al., 2018) includes many more land stations than GHCNMv3, arising from the databank efforts of Rennie et al.

A new version of the CRUTEM dataset (CRUTEMv5, Osborn et al., 2021) has increased data completeness and additional quality control measures. A new global land dataset, the China Land Surface Air Temperature (CLSAT) dataset (Xu et al., 2018) has higher network density in some regions (particularly Asia) than previously existing datasets. Global trends derived from CLSAT are generally consistent with those derived from other land datasets through 2014 (Xu et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 identified diurnal temperature range (DTR) as a substantial knowledge gap. The most recent analysis of Thorne et al.

(2005), HadEX2 (Donat et al., 2013a), HadGHCND (Donat et al., 2013b), GHCNDEX (Donat et al., 2013b), Berkeley Earth (Rohde et al., 2013), and CRU TS (Harris et al., 2014). The analysis highlighted substantial ambiguity in pre-1950 estimates arising from sparse data availability. After 1950 estimates agreed that DTR had decreased globally with most of that decrease occurring over the period 1960–1980. A subsequent DTR analysis using CLSAT further confirmed this behaviour (X. Sun et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"No recent literature has emerged to alter the AR5 finding that it is unlikely  that any uncorrected effects from urbanization (Box 10.3), or from changes in land use or land cover (Section 2.2.7), have raised global Land Surface Air Temperature (LSAT) trends by more than 10%, although larger signals have been identified in some specific regions, especially rapidly urbanizing areas such as eastern China (Y. Li et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2017; Z. Shi et al., 2019). There is also no clear indication that site-specific data homogeneity issues have had any significant impact on global trends since the early 20th century; there is more uncertainty in the 19th century, mainly arising from a lack of standardization of instrument shelters, which has been largely accounted for in data from central Europe (Jones et al., 2012), but less so elsewhere."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"At the time of AR5 a limitation of conventional datasets was the lack of coverage, especially in high latitudes, which although recognized as an issue (Simmons et al., 2010) had not been addressed in most products. Interpolation involves the statistical imputation of values across regions with limited data and can add both systematic and random uncertainties (Lenssen et al., 2019). Cowtan and Way (2014) applied a kriging-based method to extend existing datasets to polar regions, while Kadow et al. (2020) used an artificial intelligence-based method, and Vaccaro et al. (2021) used gaussian random Markov fields, for the same purpose, although only Kadow et al. (2020) uses the most recent generation of datasets as its base. The Berkeley Earth merged product (Rohde and Hausfather, 2020), HadCRUT5 (Morice et al., 2021) and NOAA GlobalTemp-Interim (Vose et al., 2021) all include interpolation over reasonable distances across data sparse regions which results in quasi-global estimates from the late 1950s when continuous Antarctic observations commenced. Interpolated datasets with substantial coverage of high latitudes show generally stronger warming of GMST than those with limited data in polar regions (Vose et al., 2021), and their strong warming at high northern latitudes is consistent with independent estimates from reanalyses (Simmons et al., 2017; Lenssen et al., 2019) and satellites (Cowtan and Way, 2014). Given the spatial scales of surface temperature variations and the verification of the methods, it is extremely likely  that interpolation results in a less-biased estimate of the actual global temperature change than ignoring regions with limited or no data."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"In total there are five conventional datasets which meet spatial coverage requirements and draw from the most recent generation of SST analyses, four of which have sufficient data in the 1850–1900 period to allow an assessment of changes from that baseline (Table 2.3). A fifth dataset is added to the assessment for changes over land areas. Datasets share SST and LSAT data products and in several cases differ solely in the post-processing interpolation applied meaning that there are far fewer methodological degrees of freedom than implied by a straight count of the number of available estimates."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p15,NO_TITLE,"Estimates of GMST have also benefitted from improved estimation of parametric uncertainties. New versions of three long-standing products from NASA GISTEMP v4 (Lenssen et al., 2019), NOAA GlobalTempv5 (B. Huang et al., 2019b) and HadCRUT5 (Morice et al., 2021) are all now available as ensemble estimates. These ensembles each account for a variety of systematic and random uncertainty effects in slightly different ways, giving broadly similar results, which are incorporated into the present assessment, with the total uncertainty generally declining up until the mid-20th century as data coverage improves."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.1.3_p16,NO_TITLE,"Another significant development has been the incorporation of reanalysis products (Section 1.5.2) into operational monitoring of GSAT. It was reported in AR5 that various reanalyses were broadly consistent with conventional surface datasets in the representation of trends since the mid-20th century. Since that time, Simmons et al. (2017) found that the ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011) and JRA-55 (Kobayashi et al., 2015) reanalyses continued to be consistent, over the last 20 years, with those surface datasets which fully represented the polar regions. GSAT trends from ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2020) are also broadly consistent with GMST trends from conventional surface datasets. However, the MERRA-2 reanalysis (Gelaro et al., 2017) GSAT spuriously cooled sharply relative to ERA-Interim and JRA-55 in about 2007 (Funk et al., 2019). Since the early 2000s, analyses of surface temperature, from which near-surface temperature may be derived, have also been available from various satellites (Famiglietti et al., 2018; Prakash et al., 2018; Susskind et al., 2019), which have the potential to improve assessments of temperature changes over data-sparse regions."

Temperatures averaged over land areas globally have warmed by 1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, substantially higher than the SST warming of 0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C. The four conventional surface temperature products which meet all criteria to be included in the final assessment (Table 2.4) agree that each of the last four decades has consecutively been the warmest globally since the beginning of their respective records (Figure 2.11c and Table 2.4). Each of the six years 2015 to 2020 has very likely been at least 0.9°C warmer than the 1850–1900 average."

These updates have led to convergence in the lower stratosphere layer (Maycock et al., 2018); in particular, the move to UAHv6.0 has addressed homogeneity issues identified by Seidel et al.

Reanalyses products had identified limitations near the 300 hPa level where the contribution of aircraft observations has increased rapidly in recent years (Dee et al., 2011; Gelaro et al., 2017), leading to identified biases (Dee and Uppala, 2009), that have been addressed in ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020). Modern reanalyses are generally well aligned with radiosonde and satellite observations in the middle and lower troposphere and lower stratosphere. A new operational mid- and upper-stratospheric dataset (STAR) has been developed by Zou and Qian (2016), merging the previous 1979–2006 SSU dataset (Zou et al., 2014) with a dataset from 1998 onwards drawn from relevant AMSU channels (Wang and Zou, 2014).

Comparison of RO with collocated radiosondes, Vaisala RS90/92 and GCOS Reference Upper Air Network data (RS92-GDP; Dirksen et al., 2014), show very good correspondence with global annual mean differences of less than 0.2°C in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Radiosonde daytime radiation biases were identified at higher altitudes (Ladstädter et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2017). The stability of RO makes this data a useful comparator for AMSU (Chen and Zou, 2014) and radiosondes (Ho et al., 2017; Tradowsky et al., 2017), as well as anchoring post-2006 reanalyses datasets and improving their consistency in the lower and middle stratosphere (Long et al., 2017; Ho et al., 2020). The effective vertical resolution of RO measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere was found to be up to 100 m at the tropical tropopause (Zeng et al., 2019a), which is favourable for resolving atmospheric variability (Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2012; Wilhelmsen et al., 2018; Stocker et al., 2019). Temperature trends in RO products are most consistent with each other and with other observations between 8 km and 25 km (Ho et al., 2012; Steiner et al., 2013, 2020a). The uncertainty increases above 25 km for the early RO period, for which data are based on the single-satellite CHAMP mission, but data at higher altitudes become more reliable for later missions based on advanced receivers (Steiner et al., 2020a), along with the application of corrections for ionospheric effects (Danzer et al., 2020). The uncertainty due to the changing number of observations is reduced by correcting for the sampling uncertainty in RO climatological fields (e.g., Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2011). For AIRS, thus far, stability of the instrument has been constrained to less than 0.03°C per decade for selected window channels in a comparison to SSTs measured by ocean buoys (Aumann et al., 2019).

They also extend further back to the 1950s and trends since quasi-global coverage around 1960 also show warming (Table 2.5). Trends in RO and AIRS data, supported by radiosonde datasets, exhibit a warming trend in most of the mid- to upper- troposphere at all non-polar latitudes over 2002–2019.

RO data (Gao et al., 2015) indicate little change in tropopause height over the short period from 2006 to 2014, but a warming below the tropopause is observed over 2002 to 2019 (Figure 2.12)."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Substantial limitations exist in reconstructing the global hydrological cycle prior to the Quaternary, particularly during the Eocene, due to the lack of high-resolution proxy records and their sparsity. Spatial heterogeneity complicates identification of wetting and drying signals during the PETM and the EECO, with paleo data and model simulations suggesting an intensified global hydrological cycle (Carmichael et al., 2016, 2017; Hyland et al., 2017; West et al., 2020), in particular an increased specific humidity (Winnick et al., 2015; van Dijk et al., 2020). Conditions wetter than present were inferred for the MPWP (Cross Chapter Box 2.4), with intensified Asian monsoons (An et al., 2015) but with nevertheless drier conditions over tropical and subtropical SH locations (Pontes et al., 2020). A new global reconstruction of hydroclimate proxies for the LIG points to stronger boreal precipitation compared to 1850–1900 over high latitudes and especially over monsoon areas, with a more heterogeneous signal for the SH (Scussolini et al., 2019). This heterogeneity is also present in the tropics, characterized by large zonal differences in precipitation change due to the variations in the intensity of Walker circulation (Section 2.3.1.4.1). Available records indicate reduced global vegetation cover and abundant atmospheric dust deposition during the LGM (increased aridity), particularly over the tropics and high latitudes (Lamy et al., 2014; Újvári et al., 2017). This agrees with models and moisture-sensitive proxies, suggesting an overall decrease in global precipitation during the LGM relative to recent decades, albeit with regional-scale heterogeneity (Cao et al., 2019). Despite lower global precipitation amounts, research since AR5 has identified a wetting of mid-latitudes during the LGM (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Lowry and Morrill, 2018; Morrill et al., 2018), thereby complicating the characterization of the LGM as a relatively ‘dry’ period. Low evaporation rates and increased top-soil moisture during the LGM may have contributed to elevated levels of large closed-basin lakes located in the 30°–45° latitudinal belts (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Scheff et al., 2017), such as the south-west United States (e.g., Ibarra et al., 2018), southern Australia (Petherick et al., 2013; Fitzsimmons et al., 2015; Sniderman et al., 2019) and Patagonia (e.g., Quade and Kaplan, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"New analyses suggest that during the Holocene, the NH mid-latitudes became increasingly wet, in phase with the strength of the latitudinal temperature and insolation gradients (Shuman and Marsicek, 2016; Routson et al., 2019).

Zhang et al., 2018; Liefert and Shuman, 2020). The NH tropics and many regions of the SH deep tropics experienced wetting up until the early to mid-Holocene but drying thereafter (Shanahan et al., 2015; Nash et al., 2016; Muñoz et al., 2017; Quade et al., 2018). Evidence for the SH is limited, with a wetting trend during the Holocene in low latitudes of South America (Kanner et al., 2013; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2013) and parts of the African tropics (Schefuß et al., 2011; Chevalier and Chase, 2015) but a drying tendency over southern Australia and New Zealand (van den Bos et al., 2018; Barr et al., 2019) and South America (Quade and Kaplan, 2017; Moreno et al., 2018)."

These reconstructions highlighted the occurrence of multi-decadal regional mega-droughts in the NH before 1600 CE, particularly during 800–1200 CE, with a predominance of wet periods after 1700 CE (Cook et al., 2015; Rodysill et al., 2018; Shuman et al., 2018). In the SH, much of South America and the African tropics experienced a reduction of precipitation during 900–1200 CE and a wetting peak during 1500–1800 CE (Tierney et al., 2015; Nash et al., 2016; Fletcher et al., 2018; Lüning et al., 2018; Campos et al., 2019), with an opposite pattern in southern subtropical Africa (Woodborne et al., 2015; Lüning et al., 2018). Large multi-decadal variability was documented over Australia and New Zealand during the 800–1300 CE period, followed by a well-defined wet period during 1500–1800 CE (Barr et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2019)."

Hydroclimate during the CE is dominated by regional variability, generally precluding definitive statements on changes at continental and larger scales, with a general reduction of mega-drought occurrences over the last about 500 years (medium confidence).

In-situ based humidity products suffer from uncertainties over poorly sampled regions particularly in the SH (Berry and Kent, 2011; Kent et al., 2014; Willett et al., 2014). There is general consensus in the inter-annual variability and sign of trends implying high confidence in increasing specific humidity since the 1970s and decreasing relative humidity since 2000, particularly over land (Simmons et al., 2010; Willett et al., 2014, 2020). Since 2012, specific humidity over land and ocean has remained well above the 1973–2019 average and reached record or near-record values (Figure 2.13b), with the strong 2015–2016 El Niño event boosting surface moisture levels (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018). The abatement from around 2000 to 2012 reported in AR5 has not persisted. This is consistent with increases in total column water vapour (Section 2.3.1.3.3) and a resumption of rapid warming in surface temperatures (Section 2.3.1.1.3). The global averaged relative humidity however has remained depressed since 2000 (Figure 2.13d; Simmons et al., 2010; Willett et al., 2014, 2020; Dunn et al., 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Since 1973, increases in specific humidity have been widespread and significant across the majority of the land and ocean regions where observations are available (Figure 2.13a). In contrast, trends in relative humidity show distinct spatial patterns with generally increasing trends over the higher latitudes and the tropics and generally decreasing trends over the sub-tropics and mid-latitudes, particularly over land areas (Figure 2.13c). Near-surface specific humidity over the oceans has increased since the 1970s according to several in-situ, satellite and reanalysis data records (Kent et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2020; Willett et al., 2020). According to the HadISDH product, increases in specific humidity and decreases in relative humidity are significant particularly over the NH mid-latitudes (Figure 2.13a,c). Poor data coverage over the SH south of 20°S does not allow for the robust assessment of trends. Sources of uncertainty include the initial measurement accuracy, homogenization over land, observational height at ships and instrument bias adjustment over ocean, and sparse spatio-temporal sampling (Prytherch et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2019; Willett et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, observations since the 1970s show avery likely  increase in near surface specific humidity over both land and oceans.

These approaches reveal two periods of positive trends, one from 1910 to 1940 and the other from 1975 onwards (Zhang et al., 2013; Mieruch et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2018), concurrent with periods of positive SST trends (Figure 2.11). Potential sources of errors in the SST-based estimation of TCWV include both uncertainties in historical SST and uncertainties in the parameters that define the relationship between the variables (Smith and Arkin, 2015). Trends based on 20CRv2c, ERA-20C and ERA-20CM indicate an increase in TCWV over much of the global ocean since the beginning of the 20th century, particularly over the tropics (Bordi et al., 2015; Smith and Arkin, 2015; Poli et al., 2016). TCWV trends estimated since the middle of the 20th century from radiosonde observations show significant increases over North America and large portions of Eurasia, while decreases are restricted to Australia, eastern Asia and the Mediterranean region (Y. Zhang et al., 2018). Overall, there is a significant increase in TCWV over global land areas since 1979 (Chen and Liu, 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Since the late 1970s a range of satellite missions permit a quasi-global assessment of TCWV. Several satellite products provide water vapour retrievals based upon distinct spectral domains, in addition to products from radiosondes, reanalyses and GNSS radio occultation. The GEWEX Water Vapour Assessment (G-VAP) provided an intercomparison of several TCWV data records, with global coverage but limited timespan (Schröder et al., 2018). The various global products generally exhibit a positive trend since 1979 (Figure 2.14; Allan et al., 2014; Mieruch et al., 2014; Schröder et al., 2016; J. Wang et al., 2016), most evident over the tropics (Gu and Adler, 2013; Chen and Liu, 2016; Mears et al., 2018; Wang and Liu, 2020; Salamalikis et al., 2021). The existence of apparent breakpoints in several products, which are generally coincident with changes in the observing system, lead to trend estimates that are not in line with theoretical expectations imposed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (Schröder et al., 2019), although other factors such as regional moisture divergence/convergence could account for the observed TCWV-temperature scaling. Substantial potential inhomogeneities affect trend estimates based on satellite, reanalysis and merged products in particular over Central Africa, the Sahara and central South America (Schröder et al., 2016, 2019; J. Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, data gaps in observations from ground-based GNSS receivers and radiosondes lead to low confidence in TCWV estimation in these regions."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, positive trends in global total column water vapour are very likely since 1979 when globally representative direct observations began, although uncertainties associated with changes in the observing system imply medium confidence in estimation of the trend magnitudes. Low confidence in longer-term trends arises from uncertainties in the SST-TCWV relationship and current centennial scale reanalyses, particularly during the first half of the 20th century."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"In situ precipitation records over land extend back for centuries in a few locations, and to the early to mid-20th century quasi-globally. Datasets differ in their input data, completeness of records, period covered, and the gridding procedures applied, which, given spatial clustering and the small spatial scales of precipitation, results in differences in global and regional estimates of precipitation changes (Q. Sun et al., 2018; Nogueira, 2020). The spatial variability of observed long-term trends (1901–2019) based on GPCC V2020 and CRU TS 4.04 (Figure 2.15a,b) indicates significant increases in precipitation mainly over eastern North America, northern Eurasia, southern South America and north-western Australia. Decreases are strongest across tropical western and equatorial Africa and southern Asia. The temporal evolution of global annual land precipitation anomalies exhibits little consistency between GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GHCNv4 datasets, especially prior to 1950, that is associated with limitations in data coverage (Figure 2.15c; Wu et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014; Gu and Adler, 2015). These disagreements between datasets prior to the 1950s result in differences in trend estimates over global land (Table 2.6). A qualitative consistency in decadal and interdecadal variations between the products is only observed since the 1950s, with primarily positive land precipitation anomalies during the 1950s, 1970s and during 2000 to 2019 (Figure 2.15c)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Several satellite-based precipitation datasets improve the representation of the spatio-temporal changes since the late 20th century. Some of these are based exclusively on satellite data (e.g., CMORPH, Joyce et al., 2004; GSMaP, Okamoto et al., 2005), with others being combinations of in situ observations, reanalyses and satellite retrievals (e.g., CMAP, Xie and Arkin, 1997; TRMM 3B43 V7, Huffman et al., 2007 ; PERSIANN-CDR, Ashouri et al., 2015; CHIRPS, Funk et al., 2015; GPCP V2.3, Adler et al., 2018). These can be affected by systematic and random uncertainties due to inhomogeneities in the satellite-derived precipitation and station data and the uncertainties of blending algorithms (Hegerl et al., 2015; Q. Sun et al., 2018). The spatial coverage of these products is near-global, with available estimations formally covering 60°S–60°N with decreasing quality from low to high latitudes, depending on the sensors and algorithms used (Hu et al., 2019). A detailed description of the most relevant satellite products is provided in section 10.2.1.1."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Recent trends (1980–2019) for GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GPCP V2.3 show significant increases in land precipitation over tropical Africa, the eastern portions of Europe and North America, central Asia and the Maritime Continent (Figure 2.14d–f). Significant decreases are observed over central South America, western North America, northern Africa and the Middle East. A detailed assessment of the recent regional precipitation trends using the same datasets can be found in the Atlas. Global trends for 1980–2019 show a general increase in annual precipitation over land, which is particularly marked for CRU TS 4.04 and GHCNv4 (Table 2.6). These changes have been accompanied by a strengthening of precipitation seasonality over tropical land areas, although with broad spread between different satellite-based (GPCP, MSWEP_V1.2, PERSIANN-CDR) and in situ gridded datasets (GPCC, CRU TS; Chou et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020). Increasing trends since 1980, in contrast to longer-term declining trends since 1901, are particularly evident over much of Africa, while more widespread negative trends were observed over much of southern South America in the more recent period (Atlas 7.2; Knutson and Zeng, 2018). A faster recent increase in precipitation over global land is inferred comparing the precipitation trends over 1960–2019 with 1980–2019 (Table 2.6). Over the global ocean, the comparison between precipitation datasets is compromised by the different measurement periods, as well as the spatial coverage of the available products (Adler et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018; Jaber and Abu-Allaban, 2020; Nogueira, 2020), limiting the ability to assess the sign and magnitude of precipitation trends. The GPCPv2.3 database (Adler et al., 2017, 2018) exhibits an increase of 2.94 mm yr–1 per decade over 1980–2019, principally due to the trends over the Indian ocean and in the tropical western Pacific (Figure 2.15f). The regional patterns of recent trends are consistent with the documented increase in precipitation over tropical wet regions and the decrease over dry areas, estimated through GPCP v2.2 data (Liu and Allan, 2013; Trammell et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2017; Polson and Hegerl, 2017)."

A faster increase in global land precipitation was observed since the 1980s (medium confidence), with large interannual variability and regional heterogeneity. Over the global ocean there is low confidence in the estimates of precipitation trends, linked to uncertainties in satellite retrievals, merging procedures and limited in situ observations."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 concluded that the pattern of precipitation minus evaporation (P–E) over the ocean had been enhanced since the 1950s (medium confidence).

The inferred changes in P–E were consistent with the observed increased TCWV, although uncertainties in the available products prevented identifying robust trends."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Estimating global-scale trends in P–E using direct observations alone is challenging due to limited evaporation measurements and inhomogeneities in satellite-derived precipitation and evaporation datasets (Hegerl et al., 2015; López et al., 2017). Hence, the assessment of global P–E trends is generally performed using reanalyses, although changes in the observing system imply considerable uncertainty (Skliris et al., 2014). Since the second half of the 20th century, several reanalyses and observational datasets have shown increases in P–E over global land, although 75% of land areas exhibit no significant changes and both internal variability and observational uncertainty are substantial (Greve et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2016). The recently released ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) showed improvements in the representation of tropical precipitation, although it overestimates global precipitation trends in comparison to ERA-Interim and GPCP (Nogueira, 2020), and suffers from temporal changes in the annual balance between precipitation and evaporation (Hersbach et al., 2020). The spatial pattern of P–E trends over 1980–2019 (Figure 2.16a) are largely consistent with the trends in the GPCP v2.3 precipitation dataset (Figure 2.15f and Section 2.3.1.3.4) and agrees in sign with the trends from other reanalyses such as JRA-55 and MERRA-2 (L. Yu et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"A variety of reanalysis products exhibit diverse temporal evolutions of P–E (Figure 2.16b–d). Globally MERRA-2, ERA20C and ERA20CM exhibit little change whereas JRA-55, ERA5 and 20CRv3 all imply long-term changes (Figure 2.16d). A potential limitation in estimating P–E from some reanalysis products is readily apparent when considering the temporal evolution of global P–E from CFSR and MERRA (Figure 2.16d) which both exhibit strong discontinuities over the global ocean in the late 1990s. Over global land as a whole, precipitation exceeds evaporation (P–E >0) for all the reanalysis products (Figure 2.16c), with decreasing trends in P–E for ERA5 and JRA-55 and increasing trends for MERRA-2 and CFSR. The P–E over the global ocean is negative (evaporation exceeding precipitation) for most reanalyses (Figure 2.16d), with declining trends in ERA5 and MERRA-2 dominated by trends in evaporation (Bosilovich et al., 2017; Hersbach et al., 2020) (Figure 2.16d). The recent increase in ocean evaporation was also documented for several reanalyses (Craig et al., 2017) and in satellite data (Andersson et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2014), although with considerable differences between available estimates (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017; L. Yu et al., 2020). An alternative indirect approach to estimate P–E changes is based on near-surface ocean salinity (Section 2.3.3.2), which is partially driven by the freshwater flux at the ocean surface. The near-surface salinity trends are more spatially coherent compared to those revealed by P–E estimates from reanalyses, with an intensification of the water cycle over oceans, especially in subtropical regions (Durack et al., 2012; Skliris et al., 2014; L. Yu et al., 2020). However, the precise rate of water cycle intensification implied by salinity trends is sensitive to methodological choices (e.g., Skliris et al., 2016; Zika et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"In conclusion, observational uncertainty yields low confidence in globally averaged trends in P–E over the 20th century, with a spatial pattern dominated by precipitation changes over land and by evaporation increases over the ocean.

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"Human intervention on river discharge linked to increases in evapotranspiration and some reduction of intra-annual streamflow variability (Jaramillo and Destouni, 2015; Chai et al., 2020) might affect the detection of trends in extreme daily streamflow events (Do et al., 2017; Gudmundsson et al., 2019). However, these activities have a minor impact on annual streamflow compared to climate variations (Dai et al., 2009; Alkama et al., 2013). Available global studies post-1950 generally concur that there have been more rivers experiencing decreases than increases in runoff (Do et al., 2017; Su et al., 2018; Gudmundsson et al., 2019; X. Shi et al., 2019). Most of the rivers have not experienced statistically significant changes in streamflow, and when globally aggregated there is no significant change (Dai and Zhao, 2017). Global streamflow variability is strongly modulated by ENSO and PDV, with below-normal global streamflow as a response to El Niño events and vice-versa during La Niña episodes (Dai, 2016; Liang et al., 2016; Kim, 2019). The response of streamflow to changes in precipitation associated with ENSO and PDV has heterogeneous regional patterns at subcontinental scales (Section 8.3.2.9.1). No significant trends are found for reanalysis-based discharge estimates over 1993 to 2015 (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017). Uncertainties in global streamflow trends arise predominantly from changes in instrumentation, gauge restoration, recalibration of rating curves, flow regulation or channel engineering (Alkama et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et al., 2018; Ghiggi et al., 2019)."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Substantial limitations exist in reconstructing the global hydrological cycle prior to the Quaternary, particularly during the Eocene, due to the lack of high-resolution proxy records and their sparsity. Spatial heterogeneity complicates identification of wetting and drying signals during the PETM and the EECO, with paleo data and model simulations suggesting an intensified global hydrological cycle (Carmichael et al., 2016, 2017; Hyland et al., 2017; West et al., 2020), in particular an increased specific humidity (Winnick et al., 2015; van Dijk et al., 2020). Conditions wetter than present were inferred for the MPWP (Cross Chapter Box 2.4), with intensified Asian monsoons (An et al., 2015) but with nevertheless drier conditions over tropical and subtropical SH locations (Pontes et al., 2020). A new global reconstruction of hydroclimate proxies for the LIG points to stronger boreal precipitation compared to 1850–1900 over high latitudes and especially over monsoon areas, with a more heterogeneous signal for the SH (Scussolini et al., 2019). This heterogeneity is also present in the tropics, characterized by large zonal differences in precipitation change due to the variations in the intensity of Walker circulation (Section 2.3.1.4.1). Available records indicate reduced global vegetation cover and abundant atmospheric dust deposition during the LGM (increased aridity), particularly over the tropics and high latitudes (Lamy et al., 2014; Újvári et al., 2017). This agrees with models and moisture-sensitive proxies, suggesting an overall decrease in global precipitation during the LGM relative to recent decades, albeit with regional-scale heterogeneity (Cao et al., 2019). Despite lower global precipitation amounts, research since AR5 has identified a wetting of mid-latitudes during the LGM (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Lowry and Morrill, 2018; Morrill et al., 2018), thereby complicating the characterization of the LGM as a relatively ‘dry’ period. Low evaporation rates and increased top-soil moisture during the LGM may have contributed to elevated levels of large closed-basin lakes located in the 30°–45° latitudinal belts (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Scheff et al., 2017), such as the south-west United States (e.g., Ibarra et al., 2018), southern Australia (Petherick et al., 2013; Fitzsimmons et al., 2015; Sniderman et al., 2019) and Patagonia (e.g., Quade and Kaplan, 2017)."

Zhang et al., 2018; Liefert and Shuman, 2020). The NH tropics and many regions of the SH deep tropics experienced wetting up until the early to mid-Holocene but drying thereafter (Shanahan et al., 2015; Nash et al., 2016; Muñoz et al., 2017; Quade et al., 2018). Evidence for the SH is limited, with a wetting trend during the Holocene in low latitudes of South America (Kanner et al., 2013; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2013) and parts of the African tropics (Schefuß et al., 2011; Chevalier and Chase, 2015) but a drying tendency over southern Australia and New Zealand (van den Bos et al., 2018; Barr et al., 2019) and South America (Quade and Kaplan, 2017; Moreno et al., 2018)."

These reconstructions highlighted the occurrence of multi-decadal regional mega-droughts in the NH before 1600 CE, particularly during 800–1200 CE, with a predominance of wet periods after 1700 CE (Cook et al., 2015; Rodysill et al., 2018; Shuman et al., 2018). In the SH, much of South America and the African tropics experienced a reduction of precipitation during 900–1200 CE and a wetting peak during 1500–1800 CE (Tierney et al., 2015; Nash et al., 2016; Fletcher et al., 2018; Lüning et al., 2018; Campos et al., 2019), with an opposite pattern in southern subtropical Africa (Woodborne et al., 2015; Lüning et al., 2018). Large multi-decadal variability was documented over Australia and New Zealand during the 800–1300 CE period, followed by a well-defined wet period during 1500–1800 CE (Barr et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2019)."

In-situ based humidity products suffer from uncertainties over poorly sampled regions particularly in the SH (Berry and Kent, 2011; Kent et al., 2014; Willett et al., 2014). There is general consensus in the inter-annual variability and sign of trends implying high confidence in increasing specific humidity since the 1970s and decreasing relative humidity since 2000, particularly over land (Simmons et al., 2010; Willett et al., 2014, 2020). Since 2012, specific humidity over land and ocean has remained well above the 1973–2019 average and reached record or near-record values (Figure 2.13b), with the strong 2015–2016 El Niño event boosting surface moisture levels (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018). The abatement from around 2000 to 2012 reported in AR5 has not persisted. This is consistent with increases in total column water vapour (Section 2.3.1.3.3) and a resumption of rapid warming in surface temperatures (Section 2.3.1.1.3).

Near-surface specific humidity over the oceans has increased since the 1970s according to several in-situ, satellite and reanalysis data records (Kent et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2020; Willett et al., 2020). According to the HadISDH product, increases in specific humidity and decreases in relative humidity are significant particularly over the NH mid-latitudes (Figure 2.13a,c). Poor data coverage over the SH south of 20°S does not allow for the robust assessment of trends. Sources of uncertainty include the initial measurement accuracy, homogenization over land, observational height at ships and instrument bias adjustment over ocean, and sparse spatio-temporal sampling (Prytherch et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2019; Willett et al., 2020)."

TCWV trends estimated since the middle of the 20th century from radiosonde observations show significant increases over North America and large portions of Eurasia, while decreases are restricted to Australia, eastern Asia and the Mediterranean region (Y. Zhang et al., 2018). Overall, there is a significant increase in TCWV over global land areas since 1979 (Chen and Liu, 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Since the late 1970s a range of satellite missions permit a quasi-global assessment of TCWV. Several satellite products provide water vapour retrievals based upon distinct spectral domains, in addition to products from radiosondes, reanalyses and GNSS radio occultation. The GEWEX Water Vapour Assessment (G-VAP) provided an intercomparison of several TCWV data records, with global coverage but limited timespan (Schröder et al., 2018). The various global products generally exhibit a positive trend since 1979 (Figure 2.14; Allan et al., 2014; Mieruch et al., 2014; Schröder et al., 2016; J. Wang et al., 2016), most evident over the tropics (Gu and Adler, 2013; Chen and Liu, 2016; Mears et al., 2018; Wang and Liu, 2020; Salamalikis et al., 2021). The existence of apparent breakpoints in several products, which are generally coincident with changes in the observing system, lead to trend estimates that are not in line with theoretical expectations imposed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (Schröder et al., 2019), although other factors such as regional moisture divergence/convergence could account for the observed TCWV-temperature scaling. Substantial potential inhomogeneities affect trend estimates based on satellite, reanalysis and merged products in particular over Central Africa, the Sahara and central South America (Schröder et al., 2016, 2019; J. Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, data gaps in observations from ground-based GNSS receivers and radiosondes lead to low confidence in TCWV estimation in these regions."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, positive trends in global total column water vapour are very likely since 1979 when globally representative direct observations began, although uncertainties associated with changes in the observing system imply medium confidence in estimation of the trend magnitudes. Low confidence in longer-term trends arises from uncertainties in the SST-TCWV relationship and current centennial scale reanalyses, particularly during the first half of the 20th century."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"In situ precipitation records over land extend back for centuries in a few locations, and to the early to mid-20th century quasi-globally. Datasets differ in their input data, completeness of records, period covered, and the gridding procedures applied, which, given spatial clustering and the small spatial scales of precipitation, results in differences in global and regional estimates of precipitation changes (Q. Sun et al., 2018; Nogueira, 2020). The spatial variability of observed long-term trends (1901–2019) based on GPCC V2020 and CRU TS 4.04 (Figure 2.15a,b) indicates significant increases in precipitation mainly over eastern North America, northern Eurasia, southern South America and north-western Australia. Decreases are strongest across tropical western and equatorial Africa and southern Asia. The temporal evolution of global annual land precipitation anomalies exhibits little consistency between GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GHCNv4 datasets, especially prior to 1950, that is associated with limitations in data coverage (Figure 2.15c; Wu et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014; Gu and Adler, 2015). These disagreements between datasets prior to the 1950s result in differences in trend estimates over global land (Table 2.6). A qualitative consistency in decadal and interdecadal variations between the products is only observed since the 1950s, with primarily positive land precipitation anomalies during the 1950s, 1970s and during 2000 to 2019 (Figure 2.15c)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Several satellite-based precipitation datasets improve the representation of the spatio-temporal changes since the late 20th century. Some of these are based exclusively on satellite data (e.g., CMORPH, Joyce et al., 2004; GSMaP, Okamoto et al., 2005), with others being combinations of in situ observations, reanalyses and satellite retrievals (e.g., CMAP, Xie and Arkin, 1997; TRMM 3B43 V7, Huffman et al., 2007 ; PERSIANN-CDR, Ashouri et al., 2015; CHIRPS, Funk et al., 2015; GPCP V2.3, Adler et al., 2018). These can be affected by systematic and random uncertainties due to inhomogeneities in the satellite-derived precipitation and station data and the uncertainties of blending algorithms (Hegerl et al., 2015; Q. Sun et al., 2018). The spatial coverage of these products is near-global, with available estimations formally covering 60°S–60°N with decreasing quality from low to high latitudes, depending on the sensors and algorithms used (Hu et al., 2019). A detailed description of the most relevant satellite products is provided in section 10.2.1.1."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Recent trends (1980–2019) for GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GPCP V2.3 show significant increases in land precipitation over tropical Africa, the eastern portions of Europe and North America, central Asia and the Maritime Continent (Figure 2.14d–f). Significant decreases are observed over central South America, western North America, northern Africa and the Middle East. A detailed assessment of the recent regional precipitation trends using the same datasets can be found in the Atlas. Global trends for 1980–2019 show a general increase in annual precipitation over land, which is particularly marked for CRU TS 4.04 and GHCNv4 (Table 2.6). These changes have been accompanied by a strengthening of precipitation seasonality over tropical land areas, although with broad spread between different satellite-based (GPCP, MSWEP_V1.2, PERSIANN-CDR) and in situ gridded datasets (GPCC, CRU TS; Chou et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020). Increasing trends since 1980, in contrast to longer-term declining trends since 1901, are particularly evident over much of Africa, while more widespread negative trends were observed over much of southern South America in the more recent period (Atlas 7.2; Knutson and Zeng, 2018). A faster recent increase in precipitation over global land is inferred comparing the precipitation trends over 1960–2019 with 1980–2019 (Table 2.6). Over the global ocean, the comparison between precipitation datasets is compromised by the different measurement periods, as well as the spatial coverage of the available products (Adler et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018; Jaber and Abu-Allaban, 2020; Nogueira, 2020), limiting the ability to assess the sign and magnitude of precipitation trends. The GPCPv2.3 database (Adler et al., 2017, 2018) exhibits an increase of 2.94 mm yr–1 per decade over 1980–2019, principally due to the trends over the Indian ocean and in the tropical western Pacific (Figure 2.15f). The regional patterns of recent trends are consistent with the documented increase in precipitation over tropical wet regions and the decrease over dry areas, estimated through GPCP v2.2 data (Liu and Allan, 2013; Trammell et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2017; Polson and Hegerl, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"In summary, globally averaged land precipitation has likely  increased since the middle of the 20th century (medium confidence), with low confidence in trends prior to 1950. A faster increase in global land precipitation was observed since the 1980s (medium confidence), with large interannual variability and regional heterogeneity. Over the global ocean there is low confidence in the estimates of precipitation trends, linked to uncertainties in satellite retrievals, merging procedures and limited in situ observations."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 concluded that the pattern of precipitation minus evaporation (P–E) over the ocean had been enhanced since the 1950s (medium confidence).

The inferred changes in P–E were consistent with the observed increased TCWV, although uncertainties in the available products prevented identifying robust trends."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Estimating global-scale trends in P–E using direct observations alone is challenging due to limited evaporation measurements and inhomogeneities in satellite-derived precipitation and evaporation datasets (Hegerl et al., 2015; López et al., 2017). Hence, the assessment of global P–E trends is generally performed using reanalyses, although changes in the observing system imply considerable uncertainty (Skliris et al., 2014). Since the second half of the 20th century, several reanalyses and observational datasets have shown increases in P–E over global land, although 75% of land areas exhibit no significant changes and both internal variability and observational uncertainty are substantial (Greve et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2016). The recently released ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) showed improvements in the representation of tropical precipitation, although it overestimates global precipitation trends in comparison to ERA-Interim and GPCP (Nogueira, 2020), and suffers from temporal changes in the annual balance between precipitation and evaporation (Hersbach et al., 2020). The spatial pattern of P–E trends over 1980–2019 (Figure 2.16a) are largely consistent with the trends in the GPCP v2.3 precipitation dataset (Figure 2.15f and Section 2.3.1.3.4) and agrees in sign with the trends from other reanalyses such as JRA-55 and MERRA-2 (L. Yu et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"A variety of reanalysis products exhibit diverse temporal evolutions of P–E (Figure 2.16b–d). Globally MERRA-2, ERA20C and ERA20CM exhibit little change whereas JRA-55, ERA5 and 20CRv3 all imply long-term changes (Figure 2.16d). A potential limitation in estimating P–E from some reanalysis products is readily apparent when considering the temporal evolution of global P–E from CFSR and MERRA (Figure 2.16d) which both exhibit strong discontinuities over the global ocean in the late 1990s. Over global land as a whole, precipitation exceeds evaporation (P–E >0) for all the reanalysis products (Figure 2.16c), with decreasing trends in P–E for ERA5 and JRA-55 and increasing trends for MERRA-2 and CFSR. The P–E over the global ocean is negative (evaporation exceeding precipitation) for most reanalyses (Figure 2.16d), with declining trends in ERA5 and MERRA-2 dominated by trends in evaporation (Bosilovich et al., 2017; Hersbach et al., 2020) (Figure 2.16d). The recent increase in ocean evaporation was also documented for several reanalyses (Craig et al., 2017) and in satellite data (Andersson et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2014), although with considerable differences between available estimates (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017; L. Yu et al., 2020). An alternative indirect approach to estimate P–E changes is based on near-surface ocean salinity (Section 2.3.3.2), which is partially driven by the freshwater flux at the ocean surface. The near-surface salinity trends are more spatially coherent compared to those revealed by P–E estimates from reanalyses, with an intensification of the water cycle over oceans, especially in subtropical regions (Durack et al., 2012; Skliris et al., 2014; L. Yu et al., 2020). However, the precise rate of water cycle intensification implied by salinity trends is sensitive to methodological choices (e.g., Skliris et al., 2016; Zika et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"In conclusion, observational uncertainty yields low confidence in globally averaged trends in P–E over the 20th century, with a spatial pattern dominated by precipitation changes over land and by evaporation increases over the ocean.

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.3.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"Human intervention on river discharge linked to increases in evapotranspiration and some reduction of intra-annual streamflow variability (Jaramillo and Destouni, 2015; Chai et al., 2020) might affect the detection of trends in extreme daily streamflow events (Do et al., 2017; Gudmundsson et al., 2019). However, these activities have a minor impact on annual streamflow compared to climate variations (Dai et al., 2009; Alkama et al., 2013). Available global studies post-1950 generally concur that there have been more rivers experiencing decreases than increases in runoff (Do et al., 2017; Su et al., 2018; Gudmundsson et al., 2019; X. Shi et al., 2019). Most of the rivers have not experienced statistically significant changes in streamflow, and when globally aggregated there is no significant change (Dai and Zhao, 2017). Global streamflow variability is strongly modulated by ENSO and PDV, with below-normal global streamflow as a response to El Niño events and vice-versa during La Niña episodes (Dai, 2016; Liang et al., 2016; Kim, 2019). The response of streamflow to changes in precipitation associated with ENSO and PDV has heterogeneous regional patterns at subcontinental scales (Section 8.3.2.9.1). No significant trends are found for reanalysis-based discharge estimates over 1993 to 2015 (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017). Uncertainties in global streamflow trends arise predominantly from changes in instrumentation, gauge restoration, recalibration of rating curves, flow regulation or channel engineering (Alkama et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et al., 2018; Ghiggi et al., 2019)."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Paleo reconstructions of rainfall and trade winds extending over the last 100 kyr show an intensification of the NH HC concurrently with a weakening of the SH HC and a southward shift of the inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during Heinrich stadials (Deplazes et al., 2013; McGee et al., 2018; Stríkis et al., 2018; Wendt et al., 2019). An intensification of the HC associated with conditions similar to La Niña (northward migrations of both the ITCZ and the SH westerlies) was found in reconstructions for the MH (McGee et al., 2014; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019). Changes in insolation from the mid to late Holocene favoured a southward migration in the position of the ITCZ and the descending branch of the HC in the NH, approaching its current width and position (Wirth et al., 2013; Thatcher et al., 2020). Tree ring chronologies from the NH mid-latitudes over the last 800 years show that the northern edge of the HC tended to migrate southward during positive phases of ENSO and PDV, with northward shifts during negative phases (Alfaro-Sánchez et al., 2018). Between 1400 and 1850 CE the HC over both hemispheres and the ITCZ were displaced southward, consistent with occurrence of drought conditions in several NH regions (Wirth et al., 2013; Burn and Palmer, 2014; Lechleitner et al., 2017; Alfaro-Sánchez et al., 2018; Flores-Aqueveque et al., 2020). Moreover, several proxy records showed not only inter-hemispheric shifts in the ITCZ but a contraction of the tropical belt during 1400–1850 CE, which followed an expansion during 950–1250 CE (Denniston et al., 2016; Griffiths et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"From centennial-scale reanalyses, Liu et al.

A substantial discrepancy between HC characteristics in centennial-scale reanalyses and in ERA-Interim (D’Agostino and Lionello, 2017) since 1979 yields significant questions regarding their ability to capture changes in HC behaviour. Taken together with the existence of apparent non-climatic artefacts in the datasets (Nguyen et al., 2015), this implies low confidence in changes in the extent and intensity of HC derived from centennial-scale reanalyses. However, using multiple observational datasets and centennial-scale reanalyses, Bronnimann et al. (2015) identified a southward shift in the NH HC edge from 1945 to 1980 of about 0.25° latitude per decade, consistent with observed changes in global land monsoon precipitation (Section 2.3.1.4.2)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 several studies based upon a range of metrics and different reanalyses products have suggested that the annual mean HC extent has shifted poleward at an approximate rate of 0.1°–0.5° latitude per decade over the last about 40 years (Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Davis and Birner, 2017; Grise et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018, 2020; Studholme and Gulev, 2018; Grise and Davis, 2020). The observed widening of the annual mean HC, revealed by a variety of metrics, is primarily due to poleward shift of the Northern Hemisphere HC. There have been stronger upward trends in the NH extent of HC after 1992 (Figure 2.17a). The estimated magnitude of the recent changes based on modern-era reanalyses is not as large as that in AR5, due to apparent biases in older-generation reanalyses (Grise et al., 2019). Moreover, large interannual variability leads to uncertainties in estimates of long-term changes (Nguyen et al., 2013; Garfinkel et al., 2015b; Seviour et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018), particularly for the NH given its zonal asymmetries (Staten et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). These large-scale features of the HC based on reanalyses agree with estimates revealed from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) during 1979–2012 (Lucas and Nguyen, 2015; Mathew et al., 2016). Recent trends based on reanalyses indicate a larger seasonal widening in the HC for summer and autumn in each hemisphere, although the magnitude of changes in HC extent is strongly dependent on dataset and metrics used (Grise et al., 2018; Y. Hu et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018). The shifts in the HC position were accompanied by a narrowing ITCZ over the Atlantic and Pacific basins, with no significant change in its location and increases in the precipitation intensity (Byrne et al., 2018)."

Huang et al., 2019), which is more marked in the NH than the SH (Studholme and Gulev, 2018). However, the ability of reanalyses to represent the HC strength has been questioned due to inaccurate representation of latent heating distribution, which is directly related to tropical convection and influences the HC dynamics (Chemke and Polvani, 2019; Mathew and Kumar, 2019)."

During the Holocene, a transition from a strong WC located more westward during the Early-to-Mid Holocene towards a weak and eastward shifted WC during the late Holocene was inferred from proxy records from the Pacific Warm Pool and South East Asia (Barr et al., 2019; Dang et al., 2020; Griffiths et al., 2020), in concurrence with changes in ENSO activity (Section 2.4.2). Reconstructions for the CE showed weakened WC during 1000–1250 and since 1850, with an intensified circulation during 1500–1850 CE (Xu et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Considering instrumental records, there is considerable interdecadal variability in the strength of the WC, resulting in time-period dependent magnitude and even sign of trends (Carilli et al., 2015; Bordbar et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2018), with some studies reporting weakening over the 20th century (e.g., Power and Kociuba, 2011; Liu et al., 2019), while others reported strengthening (Z. Li et al., 2020), particularly over the last 30–40 years (e.g., Hu et al., 2013; L’Heureux et al., 2013; Yim et al., 2017). Based on estimation of changes in mid-tropospheric velocity from changes in observed cloud cover, Bellomo and Clement (2015) suggest a weakening and eastward shift of the WC over 1920–2010, however the robustness of this signal is questionable due to high uncertainty in the ship-reported cloud data used before 1954. Using centennial-scale 20CR reanalysis Tseng et al. (2019) showed that the vertical westerly wind shear over the western Pacific does not indicate any long-term change during 1900–1980, but shows a marked increase since the 1980s that is not present in ERA-Interim and JRA-55, again calling into question the ability of centennial-scale reanalyses to capture tropical circulation changes. Recent strengthening together with a westward shift of the WC (Bayr et al., 2014; Ma and Zhou, 2016) was identified across several reanalysis products and observational datasets, and using different metrics for quantifying WC. Nevertheless, satellite observations of precipitation and analyses of upper tropospheric humidity suggest substantially weaker strengthening of the WC than implied by reanalyses (Chung et al., 2019). This recent strengthening in the WC is associated with enhanced precipitation in the tropical western Pacific, anomalous westerlies in the upper troposphere, strengthened downwelling in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and anomalous surface easterlies in the western and central tropical Pacific (Dong and Lu, 2013; McGregor et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). Positive trends in sea level pressure over the eastern Pacific and concurrent negative trends over the Indonesian region result in a pattern implying a shift towards a La Niña-like WC regime, with strengthening of the Pacific Trade Winds mainly over 1979–2012 (L’Heureux et al., 2013; England et al., 2014; Sohn et al., 2016; Zhao and Allen, 2019).

There is low confidence in the estimation of long-term trends in the strength of the Walker circulation, which are time period dependent and subject to dataset uncertainties.

Wang et al., 2017; Seth et al., 2019), with intensified NH monsoon systems during precession minima (Toucanne et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2019). The eccentricity forcing (about 100 kyr cycle) shows stronger GM during interglacial periods (P.X. Wang et al., 2014, 2017; An et al., 2015; Mohtadi et al., 2016). Changes in obliquity (about 41 kyr cycle) modify the strength of monsoon systems, with increased summer monsoon rainfall when obliquity is maximal (Y. Liu et al., 2015b; Mohtadi et al., 2016). Millennial scale variability in GM during the LDT was also linked to the occurrences of Heinrich stadials, resulting in weakened NH monsoons and intensified SH monsoons (An et al., 2015; P.X.

A decline in GM precipitation and a retraction of the northern fringes of monsoon areas was inferred from the mid-Holocene onwards, with some regions experiencing wetter conditions during the mid to late Holocene compared with present and a strengthening of the SH monsoons (P.X.

An overall increase in monsoon precipitation during extended boreal summer (JJAS) over the NH since 1979 is revealed by GPCP (Deng et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019) and CMAP for 1980–2010 (Jiang et al., 2016). SH summer monsoon behaviour is dominated by strong interannual variability and large regional differences (Kitoh et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2016; Kamae et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019), with no significant trends reported by GPCP and CMAP (Deng et al., 2018). Uncertainty predominantly arises from the observed increase in tropical precipitation seasonality (Feng et al., 2013) and the estimation of GM precipitation over the ocean areas, leading to a large apparent spread across datasets (Kitoh et al., 2013; Kamae et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, observed trends during the last century indicate that the GM precipitation decline reported in AR5 has reversed since the 1980s, with a likely  increase mainly due to a significant positive trend in the NH summer monsoon precipitation (medium confidence). However, GM precipitation has exhibited large multi-decadal variability over the last century, creating low confidence in the existence of centennial-length trends in the instrumental record. Proxy reconstructions show a likely NH monsoons weakening since the mid-Holocene, with opposite behaviour for the SH monsoons."

A variety of proxies are available for the changes in the position of the extratropical jets/westerlies during the Holocene. Recent syntheses of moisture-sensitive proxy records indicate drier-than-present conditions over mid-latitudes of western North America (Hermann et al., 2018; Liefert and Shuman, 2020) during the MH, which together with a weakened Aleutian Low (Bailey et al., 2018) implies that the winter North Pacific jetstream was shifted northward. A synthesis of lines of evidence from the SH indicates that the westerly winds were stronger over 14–5 ka, followed by regional asymmetry after 5 ka (Fletcher and Moreno, 2012). There is no consensus on the shifts of the SH westerlies with some studies implying poleward migrations (Lamy et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2015; Turney et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018) and others suggesting an equatorward shift (Kaplan et al., 2016) in the MH."

Wang et al., 2017a). Storm tracks over the North Atlantic-European sector shifted northward as indicated by multi-proxy indicators over the North Atlantic (Wirth et al., 2013; Orme et al., 2017) and Mediterranean (Roberts et al., 2012). Reconstructed westerly winds in the SH suggest a poleward shift (Lamy et al., 2010; Schimpf et al., 2011; Goodwin et al., 2014; Koffman et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2018), with latitudinal change comparable to that during recent decades (Swart and Fyfe, 2012; Manney and Hegglin, 2018)."

Lee et al., 2019). Over NH mid-latitudes, the summer zonal wind speeds have weakened in the mid-troposphere (Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Coumou et al., 2014, 2015; Haimberger and Mayer, 2017). Meanwhile there are indications of enhanced jetstream meandering in boreal autumn at the hemispheric scale (Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Di Capua and Coumou, 2016), whereas the regional arrangement of meandering depends on the background atmospheric state (Cohen et al., 2020). These meandering trends, however, are sensitive to the metrics used (Screen and Simmonds, 2013; Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Cattiaux et al., 2016; Vavrus, 2018).

In recent decades the number of deep extratropical cyclones has increased over the SH (Section 8.3.2.8.1 and Figure 8.12; Reboita et al., 2015; X.L.

This is generally consistent with the previously reported shifts retrieved from satellite temperature observations (Fu and Lin, 2011; Davis and Rosenlof, 2012). After the 1960s the magnitude of meridional shifts in extratropical jets over both the North Atlantic and North Pacific in August is enhanced compared to multi-century variability (Trouet et al., 2018). Despite some regional differences (Woollings et al., 2014; Norris et al., 2016; J. Wang et al., 2017a; Xue and Zhang, 2017; Ma and Zhang, 2018; Melamed-Turkish et al., 2018), overall poleward deflection of storm tracks in boreal winter over both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific was identified during 1979–2010 (Tilinina et al., 2013). Over the SH extra-tropics there is a similarly robust poleward shift in the polar jet since 1979 (Pena-Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018; WMO, 2018), although after 2000 the December–January–February (DJF) tendency to poleward shift of the SH jet stream position ceased (Banerjee et al., 2020). The general poleward movement in midlatitude jet streams (Lucas et al., 2014) is consistent with the expansion of the tropical circulation (Section 2.3.1.4.1). The changes of extratropical jets and westerlies are also related to the annular modes of variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Robust trends in blocking have only been found in certain regions and specific seasons during recent decades. Increases in blocking frequency have occurred over low-latitude regions in the North Atlantic in boreal winter (Davini et al., 2012), the South Atlantic in austral summer (Dennison et al., 2016) and the southern Indian Ocean in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). Over the subpolar North Atlantic sustained periods of positive Greenland blocking were identified during 1870–1900 and from the late 1990s to 2015 (Hanna et al., 2015). Further analysis of association of Greenland blocking with the NAM is provided in Section 2.4.1.1. Meanwhile, a reduced blocking frequency has been found over winter in Siberia (Davini et al., 2012) and the south-western Pacific in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). Over eastern European Russia and western Siberia (40°E–100°E) a tendency towards longer blocking events was reported by Luo et al. (2016) for 2000–2013 and by Tyrlis et al. (2020) for 1979–2017. Inter-annual variance in the number of blocking events over the SH (Oliveira et al., 2014) and North Atlantic (Kim and Ha, 2015) has enhanced. Blocking events and their trends are sensitive to choice of datasets, calculation periods and methods (Cheung et al., 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; Pepler et al., 2018; Rohrer et al., 2018; Woollings et al., 2018b; Kononova and Lupo, 2020).

There is low confidence in shifting of extratropical jets in the NH during the mid-Holocene and over 950–1400 CE to latitudes that likely  were similar to those since 1979.

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Terrestrial in situ wind datasets have been updated and the quality-control procedures have been improved, with particular attention to homogeneity and to better retaining true extreme values (Dunn et al., 2012, 2014, 2016). Global mean land wind speed (excluding Australia) from HadISD for 1979–2018 shows a reduction (stilling) of 0.063 m s–1 per decade (Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). Trends are broadly insensitive to the subsets of stations used. Although the meteorological stations are unevenly distributed worldwide and sparse in South America and Africa, the majority exhibit stilling particularly in the NH (Figure 2.19). Regionally, strong decreasing trends are reported in central Asia and North America (–0.106 and –0.084 m s–1 per decade respectively) during 1979–2018 (McVicar et al., 2012; Vautard et al., 2012; J. Wu et al., 2018; Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). This stilling tendency has reversed after 2010 and the global mean surface winds have strengthened (Zeng et al., 2019b; Azorin-Molina et al., 2020), although the robustness of this reversal is unclear given the short period and interannual variability (Kousari et al., 2013; Kim and Paik, 2015; Azorin-Molina et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Over the ocean, datasets demonstrate considerable disagreement in surface wind speed trends and spatial features (Kent et al., 2013). Global ocean surface winds from NOCv2.0 demonstrate upward trends of about 0.11 m s–1 per decade (1979–2015) with somewhat smaller trends from WASwind for 1979–2011 (Azorin-Molina et al., 2017, 2019). The trends are consistent until 1998, but diverge thereafter. Both ERA5 and JRA-55 reanalyses show consistently increasing global marine wind speeds over 1979–2015, though flattening since 2000, whereas MERRA-2 agrees until 1998, but then exhibits increased variability and an overall decrease in the last two decades (Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). This agrees with estimates by Sharmar et al. (2021) showing upward ocean wind trends from 1979 to 2000 which are consistent in ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2, but disagree with CFSR trends for the same period. Over 2000–2019 all reanalyses show diverging tendencies. An updated multiplatform satellite database (comprising data from altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers) from 1985–2018 shows small increases in mean wind speed over the global ocean, with the largest increase observed in the Southern Ocean (Young and Ribal, 2019), consistent with signals in ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2 (Sharmar et al., 2021). Overall, most products suggest positive trends over the Southern Ocean, western North Atlantic and the tropical eastern Pacific since the early 1980s."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"The modern era reanalyses exhibit SLP increases over the SH subtropics with stronger increases in austral winter over 1979–2018.

Discrepancies in the low-frequency variations during the first half of the 20th century exist in the centennial-scale reanalysis products (Befort et al., 2016). Overall, modern reanalysis datasets support the AR5 conclusion that there is no clear signal for trends in the strength and position of the permanent and quasi-permanent pressure centres of action since the 1950s. Instead, they highlight multi-decadal variations. Large-scale SLP is strongly associated with the changes in modes of variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV)."

Mitchell et al., 2013; Kretschmer et al., 2018). Errors in reanalysis stratospheric winds were assessed and discrepancies in stratospheric atmospheric circulation and temperatures between reanalyses, satellites and radiosondes have been reported (D.M.

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"The northern stratospheric polar vortex has varied intra-seasonally and with altitude during recent decades. Multiple reanalysis and radiosonde datasets show that the midwinter lower stratospheric geopotential height (150 hPa) over the polar region north of 60°N has increased significantly since the early 1980s (Bohlinger et al., 2014; Garfinkel et al., 2017). This signal extends to the middle and upper stratosphere. In January-February zonal winds north of 60°N at 10 hPa have been weakening (Kim et al., 2014; Kretschmer et al., 2018). Daily atmospheric circulation patterns over the northern polar stratosphere exhibit a decreasing frequency of strong vortex events and commensurate increase in more-persistent weak events, which largely explains the observed significant weakening of the vortex during 1979–2015 (Kretschmer et al., 2018). The northern polar vortex has weakened in early winter but strengthened during late winter (Bohlinger et al., 2014; Garfinkel et al., 2015a, 2017; Ivy et al., 2016; Seviour, 2017; Kretschmer et al., 2018). In the middle and upper stratosphere, a strengthening trend of the northern polar vortex during DJF has occurred since 1998, contrasting the weakening trend beforehand (D. Hu et al., 2018). The position of the polar vortex also has long-term variations, exhibiting a persistent shift toward Northern Siberia and away from North America in February over the period 1979–2015 (Zhang et al., 2016; J. Zhang et al., 2018). Multiple measures show similar location changes (Seviour, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), a phenomenon of rapid stratospheric air temperature increases (sometimes by more than 50°C in 1–2 days), is tightly associated with the reversal of upper stratospheric zonal winds, and a resulting collapse or substantial weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex (Butler et al., 2015; Butler and Gerber, 2018) and on average occurs approximately 6 times per decade in the NH winter (Charlton et al., 2007; Butler et al., 2015). The SSW record from all modern reanalyses is very consistent. There is a higher occurrence of major midwinter SSWs in the 1980s and 2000s with no SSW events during 1990–1997 (Reichler et al., 2012; Butler et al., 2015). An assessment of multi-decadal variability and change in SSW events is sensitive to both chosen metric and methods (Palmeiro et al., 2015). Due to the lack of assimilation of upper air data, the centennial-scale reanalyses do not capture SSW events, even for the most recent decades (Butler et al., 2015, 2017) and hence cannot inform on earlier behaviour. There has been considerably less study of trends in the SH stratosphere polar vortex strength despite the interest in the ozone hole and the potential impact of the SH stratosphere polar vortex strength on it. The occurrence of SSW events in the SH is not as frequent as in the NH, with only 3 documented events in the last 40 years (Shen et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, it is likely  that the northern lower stratospheric polar vortex has weakened since the 1980s in midwinter, and its location has shifted more frequently toward the Eurasian continent.

There was  high confidence that the post-1990s strengthening of the Pacific WC reversed its weakening observed from the mid-19th century to the 1990s."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Paleo reconstructions of rainfall and trade winds extending over the last 100 kyr show an intensification of the NH HC concurrently with a weakening of the SH HC and a southward shift of the inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during Heinrich stadials (Deplazes et al., 2013; McGee et al., 2018; Stríkis et al., 2018; Wendt et al., 2019). An intensification of the HC associated with conditions similar to La Niña (northward migrations of both the ITCZ and the SH westerlies) was found in reconstructions for the MH (McGee et al., 2014; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019). Changes in insolation from the mid to late Holocene favoured a southward migration in the position of the ITCZ and the descending branch of the HC in the NH, approaching its current width and position (Wirth et al., 2013; Thatcher et al., 2020). Tree ring chronologies from the NH mid-latitudes over the last 800 years show that the northern edge of the HC tended to migrate southward during positive phases of ENSO and PDV, with northward shifts during negative phases (Alfaro-Sánchez et al., 2018). Between 1400 and 1850 CE the HC over both hemispheres and the ITCZ were displaced southward, consistent with occurrence of drought conditions in several NH regions (Wirth et al., 2013; Burn and Palmer, 2014; Lechleitner et al., 2017; Alfaro-Sánchez et al., 2018; Flores-Aqueveque et al., 2020). Moreover, several proxy records showed not only inter-hemispheric shifts in the ITCZ but a contraction of the tropical belt during 1400–1850 CE, which followed an expansion during 950–1250 CE (Denniston et al., 2016; Griffiths et al., 2016)."

A substantial discrepancy between HC characteristics in centennial-scale reanalyses and in ERA-Interim (D’Agostino and Lionello, 2017) since 1979 yields significant questions regarding their ability to capture changes in HC behaviour. Taken together with the existence of apparent non-climatic artefacts in the datasets (Nguyen et al., 2015), this implies low confidence in changes in the extent and intensity of HC derived from centennial-scale reanalyses. However, using multiple observational datasets and centennial-scale reanalyses, Bronnimann et al. (2015) identified a southward shift in the NH HC edge from 1945 to 1980 of about 0.25° latitude per decade, consistent with observed changes in global land monsoon precipitation (Section 2.3.1.4.2)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 several studies based upon a range of metrics and different reanalyses products have suggested that the annual mean HC extent has shifted poleward at an approximate rate of 0.1°–0.5° latitude per decade over the last about 40 years (Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Davis and Birner, 2017; Grise et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018, 2020; Studholme and Gulev, 2018; Grise and Davis, 2020). The observed widening of the annual mean HC, revealed by a variety of metrics, is primarily due to poleward shift of the Northern Hemisphere HC. There have been stronger upward trends in the NH extent of HC after 1992 (Figure 2.17a). The estimated magnitude of the recent changes based on modern-era reanalyses is not as large as that in AR5, due to apparent biases in older-generation reanalyses (Grise et al., 2019). Moreover, large interannual variability leads to uncertainties in estimates of long-term changes (Nguyen et al., 2013; Garfinkel et al., 2015b; Seviour et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018), particularly for the NH given its zonal asymmetries (Staten et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). These large-scale features of the HC based on reanalyses agree with estimates revealed from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) during 1979–2012 (Lucas and Nguyen, 2015; Mathew et al., 2016). Recent trends based on reanalyses indicate a larger seasonal widening in the HC for summer and autumn in each hemisphere, although the magnitude of changes in HC extent is strongly dependent on dataset and metrics used (Grise et al., 2018; Y. Hu et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018). The shifts in the HC position were accompanied by a narrowing ITCZ over the Atlantic and Pacific basins, with no significant change in its location and increases in the precipitation intensity (Byrne et al., 2018)."

Huang et al., 2019), which is more marked in the NH than the SH (Studholme and Gulev, 2018). However, the ability of reanalyses to represent the HC strength has been questioned due to inaccurate representation of latent heating distribution, which is directly related to tropical convection and influences the HC dynamics (Chemke and Polvani, 2019; Mathew and Kumar, 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Paleo evidence during the LGM indicates a weaker WC over the Indian Ocean (DiNezio et al., 2018; Windler et al., 2019) with a stronger Pacific WC (DiNezio and Tierney, 2013). During the Holocene, a transition from a strong WC located more westward during the Early-to-Mid Holocene towards a weak and eastward shifted WC during the late Holocene was inferred from proxy records from the Pacific Warm Pool and South East Asia (Barr et al., 2019; Dang et al., 2020; Griffiths et al., 2020), in concurrence with changes in ENSO activity (Section 2.4.2). Reconstructions for the CE showed weakened WC during 1000–1250 and since 1850, with an intensified circulation during 1500–1850 CE (Xu et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Considering instrumental records, there is considerable interdecadal variability in the strength of the WC, resulting in time-period dependent magnitude and even sign of trends (Carilli et al., 2015; Bordbar et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2018), with some studies reporting weakening over the 20th century (e.g., Power and Kociuba, 2011; Liu et al., 2019), while others reported strengthening (Z. Li et al., 2020), particularly over the last 30–40 years (e.g., Hu et al., 2013; L’Heureux et al., 2013; Yim et al., 2017). Based on estimation of changes in mid-tropospheric velocity from changes in observed cloud cover, Bellomo and Clement (2015) suggest a weakening and eastward shift of the WC over 1920–2010, however the robustness of this signal is questionable due to high uncertainty in the ship-reported cloud data used before 1954. Using centennial-scale 20CR reanalysis Tseng et al. (2019) showed that the vertical westerly wind shear over the western Pacific does not indicate any long-term change during 1900–1980, but shows a marked increase since the 1980s that is not present in ERA-Interim and JRA-55, again calling into question the ability of centennial-scale reanalyses to capture tropical circulation changes. Recent strengthening together with a westward shift of the WC (Bayr et al., 2014; Ma and Zhou, 2016) was identified across several reanalysis products and observational datasets, and using different metrics for quantifying WC. Nevertheless, satellite observations of precipitation and analyses of upper tropospheric humidity suggest substantially weaker strengthening of the WC than implied by reanalyses (Chung et al., 2019). This recent strengthening in the WC is associated with enhanced precipitation in the tropical western Pacific, anomalous westerlies in the upper troposphere, strengthened downwelling in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and anomalous surface easterlies in the western and central tropical Pacific (Dong and Lu, 2013; McGregor et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). Positive trends in sea level pressure over the eastern Pacific and concurrent negative trends over the Indonesian region result in a pattern implying a shift towards a La Niña-like WC regime, with strengthening of the Pacific Trade Winds mainly over 1979–2012 (L’Heureux et al., 2013; England et al., 2014; Sohn et al., 2016; Zhao and Allen, 2019). Seasonal assessment of the WC showed significant changes in the vertical westerly wind shear over the Pacific during the austral summer and autumn implying a strengthening (Clem et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there has been a likely  widening of the Hadley circulation since the 1980s, mostly due to its extension in the NH, although there is only medium confidence in the extent of the changes. This has been accompanied by a strengthening of the Hadley circulation, particularly in the NH (medium confidence). There is low confidence in the estimation of long-term trends in the strength of the Walker circulation, which are time period dependent and subject to dataset uncertainties. Trends since 1980 are better characterized and consistent with avery likely strengthening that resembles a La Niña-like Walker circulation and a westward shift of the Walker circulation, although with medium confidence in the magnitude of the changes, arising from the differences between satellite observations and reanalysis products."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 reported a weakening of the global monsoon (GM) circulation as well as a decrease of global land monsoon rainfall over the second half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there was low confidence in the observed circulation trends due to uncertainties in reanalysis products and in the definition of the monsoon area. From a paleo perspective, AR5 only assessed regional monsoon changes."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"New research based on high-resolution proxies reinforces previous findings on the influence of orbital cycles on GM variability on millennial time scales. The intensity of the monsoon systems is generally out of phase between hemispheres, being associated with the precession cycle (about 21–23 kyr) (An et al., 2015; P.X. Wang et al., 2017; Seth et al., 2019), with intensified NH monsoon systems during precession minima (Toucanne et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2019). The eccentricity forcing (about 100 kyr cycle) shows stronger GM during interglacial periods (P.X. Wang et al., 2014, 2017; An et al., 2015; Mohtadi et al., 2016). Changes in obliquity (about 41 kyr cycle) modify the strength of monsoon systems, with increased summer monsoon rainfall when obliquity is maximal (Y. Liu et al., 2015b; Mohtadi et al., 2016). Millennial scale variability in GM during the LDT was also linked to the occurrences of Heinrich stadials, resulting in weakened NH monsoons and intensified SH monsoons (An et al., 2015; P.X. Wang et al., 2017; Margari et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"An intensification of the NH monsoons in the early to mid-Holocene with increased precipitation and regional expansions of rainfall areas identified through a variety of proxy records is shown by Biasutti et al. (2018) and P.X. Wang et al. (2017). The response for the SH monsoons during this period indicates a weakening in both summer and winter precipitation (P.X. Wang et al., 2014, 2017; Sachs et al., 2018). A decline in GM precipitation and a retraction of the northern fringes of monsoon areas was inferred from the mid-Holocene onwards, with some regions experiencing wetter conditions during the mid to late Holocene compared with present and a strengthening of the SH monsoons (P.X. Wang et al., 2014, 2017; Sachs et al., 2018). For the CE, GM reconstructions exhibit inter-hemispheric contrast during the period 950–1250 CE, with intensified NH monsoons and weakened SH monsoons, and the opposite pattern during 1400–1850 CE (P.X. Wang et al., 2014; An et al., 2015)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Direct observations highlight that the GM land precipitation, particularly over the NH, experienced a slight increase from 1900 through the early 1950s, followed by an overall decrease from the 1950s to the 1980s, and then an increase to present (Kitoh et al., 2013; B. Wang et al., 2018, 2021; X. Huang et al., 2019b). This highlights the existence of multi-decadal variations in the NH monsoon circulation patterns and precipitation intensity (Wang et al., 2013; P.X. Wang et al., 2014, 2017; Monerie et al., 2019). An overall increase in monsoon precipitation during extended boreal summer (JJAS) over the NH since 1979 is revealed by GPCP (Deng et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019) and CMAP for 1980–2010 (Jiang et al., 2016). SH summer monsoon behaviour is dominated by strong interannual variability and large regional differences (Kitoh et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2016; Kamae et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019), with no significant trends reported by GPCP and CMAP (Deng et al., 2018). Uncertainty predominantly arises from the observed increase in tropical precipitation seasonality (Feng et al., 2013) and the estimation of GM precipitation over the ocean areas, leading to a large apparent spread across datasets (Kitoh et al., 2013; Kamae et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, observed trends during the last century indicate that the GM precipitation decline reported in AR5 has reversed since the 1980s, with a likely  increase mainly due to a significant positive trend in the NH summer monsoon precipitation (medium confidence). However, GM precipitation has exhibited large multi-decadal variability over the last century, creating low confidence in the existence of centennial-length trends in the instrumental record. Proxy reconstructions show a likely NH monsoons weakening since the mid-Holocene, with opposite behaviour for the SH monsoons."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Proxy records consistent with modelling results imply a southward shift of the storm tracks over the North Atlantic during the LGM (Raible et al., 2021). A variety of proxies are available for the changes in the position of the extratropical jets/westerlies during the Holocene. Recent syntheses of moisture-sensitive proxy records indicate drier-than-present conditions over mid-latitudes of western North America (Hermann et al., 2018; Liefert and Shuman, 2020) during the MH, which together with a weakened Aleutian Low (Bailey et al., 2018) implies that the winter North Pacific jetstream was shifted northward. A synthesis of lines of evidence from the SH indicates that the westerly winds were stronger over 14–5 ka, followed by regional asymmetry after 5 ka (Fletcher and Moreno, 2012). There is no consensus on the shifts of the SH westerlies with some studies implying poleward migrations (Lamy et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2015; Turney et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018) and others suggesting an equatorward shift (Kaplan et al., 2016) in the MH."

Wang et al., 2017a). Storm tracks over the North Atlantic-European sector shifted northward as indicated by multi-proxy indicators over the North Atlantic (Wirth et al., 2013; Orme et al., 2017) and Mediterranean (Roberts et al., 2012). Reconstructed westerly winds in the SH suggest a poleward shift (Lamy et al., 2010; Schimpf et al., 2011; Goodwin et al., 2014; Koffman et al., 2014; Moreno et al., 2018), with latitudinal change comparable to that during recent decades (Swart and Fyfe, 2012; Manney and Hegglin, 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Multiple reanalyses show that since 1979 the subtropical jet wind speeds have generally increased in winter and decreased in summer in both hemispheres, but the trends are regionally dependent (Pena-Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018; S.H. Lee et al., 2019). Over NH mid-latitudes, the summer zonal wind speeds have weakened in the mid-troposphere (Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Coumou et al., 2014, 2015; Haimberger and Mayer, 2017). Meanwhile there are indications of enhanced jetstream meandering in boreal autumn at the hemispheric scale (Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Di Capua and Coumou, 2016), whereas the regional arrangement of meandering depends on the background atmospheric state (Cohen et al., 2020). These meandering trends, however, are sensitive to the metrics used (Screen and Simmonds, 2013; Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Cattiaux et al., 2016; Vavrus, 2018). Hypothesized links to Arctic warming are assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 10.1."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Multiple reanalyses and radiosonde observations show an increasing number of extratropical cyclones over the NH since the 1950s (Chang and Yau, 2016; X.L.

In recent decades the number of deep extratropical cyclones has increased over the SH (Section 8.3.2.8.1 and Figure 8.12; Reboita et al., 2015; X.L.

Wang et al., 2017a; Gertler and O’Gorman, 2019). The regional changes for different intensity extratropical cyclones are assessed in Section 8.3.2.8.1. The assessment of trends is complicated by strong interannual to decadal variability, sensitivity to dataset choice and resolution (Tilinina et al., 2013; Lucas et al., 2014; X.L. Wang et al., 2016; Pepler et al., 2018; Rohrer et al., 2018) and cyclone identification/tracking methods (Neu et al., 2013; Grieger et al., 2018). Thus there is overall low confidence for recent changes in global extratropical storm tracks."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"A consistent poleward shift of the tropospheric extratropical jets since 1979 is reported by multiple reanalyses (Figure 2.18; Davis and Rosenlof, 2012; Davis and Birner, 2013; Pena-Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018), and radiosonde winds (Allen et al., 2012). This is generally consistent with the previously reported shifts retrieved from satellite temperature observations (Fu and Lin, 2011; Davis and Rosenlof, 2012). After the 1960s the magnitude of meridional shifts in extratropical jets over both the North Atlantic and North Pacific in August is enhanced compared to multi-century variability (Trouet et al., 2018). Despite some regional differences (Woollings et al., 2014; Norris et al., 2016; J. Wang et al., 2017a; Xue and Zhang, 2017; Ma and Zhang, 2018; Melamed-Turkish et al., 2018), overall poleward deflection of storm tracks in boreal winter over both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific was identified during 1979–2010 (Tilinina et al., 2013). Over the SH extra-tropics there is a similarly robust poleward shift in the polar jet since 1979 (Pena-Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018; WMO, 2018), although after 2000 the December–January–February (DJF) tendency to poleward shift of the SH jet stream position ceased (Banerjee et al., 2020). The general poleward movement in midlatitude jet streams (Lucas et al., 2014) is consistent with the expansion of the tropical circulation (Section 2.3.1.4.1). The changes of extratropical jets and westerlies are also related to the annular modes of variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Robust trends in blocking have only been found in certain regions and specific seasons during recent decades. Increases in blocking frequency have occurred over low-latitude regions in the North Atlantic in boreal winter (Davini et al., 2012), the South Atlantic in austral summer (Dennison et al., 2016) and the southern Indian Ocean in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). Over the subpolar North Atlantic sustained periods of positive Greenland blocking were identified during 1870–1900 and from the late 1990s to 2015 (Hanna et al., 2015). Further analysis of association of Greenland blocking with the NAM is provided in Section 2.4.1.1. Meanwhile, a reduced blocking frequency has been found over winter in Siberia (Davini et al., 2012) and the south-western Pacific in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). Over eastern European Russia and western Siberia (40°E–100°E) a tendency towards longer blocking events was reported by Luo et al. (2016) for 2000–2013 and by Tyrlis et al. (2020) for 1979–2017. Inter-annual variance in the number of blocking events over the SH (Oliveira et al., 2014) and North Atlantic (Kim and Ha, 2015) has enhanced. Blocking events and their trends are sensitive to choice of datasets, calculation periods and methods (Cheung et al., 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; Pepler et al., 2018; Rohrer et al., 2018; Woollings et al., 2018b; Kononova and Lupo, 2020). As a result, hemispheric and global trends in blocking frequency have overall low confidence. "
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"In summary, the total number of extratropical cyclones has likely  increased since the 1980s in the NH (low confidence), but with fewer deep cyclones particularly in summer. The number of strong extratropical cyclones has likely  increased in the SH (medium confidence). The extratropical jets and cyclone tracks have likely been shifting poleward in both hemispheres since the 1980s with marked seasonality in trends (medium confidence). There is low confidence in shifting of extratropical jets in the NH during the mid-Holocene and over 950–1400 CE to latitudes that likely  were similar to those since 1979. There is low confidence in observed global-scale changes in the occurrence of blocking events."

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Terrestrial in situ wind datasets have been updated and the quality-control procedures have been improved, with particular attention to homogeneity and to better retaining true extreme values (Dunn et al., 2012, 2014, 2016). Global mean land wind speed (excluding Australia) from HadISD for 1979–2018 shows a reduction (stilling) of 0.063 m s–1 per decade (Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). Trends are broadly insensitive to the subsets of stations used. Although the meteorological stations are unevenly distributed worldwide and sparse in South America and Africa, the majority exhibit stilling particularly in the NH (Figure 2.19). Regionally, strong decreasing trends are reported in central Asia and North America (–0.106 and –0.084 m s–1 per decade respectively) during 1979–2018 (McVicar et al., 2012; Vautard et al., 2012; J. Wu et al., 2018; Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). This stilling tendency has reversed after 2010 and the global mean surface winds have strengthened (Zeng et al., 2019b; Azorin-Molina et al., 2020), although the robustness of this reversal is unclear given the short period and interannual variability (Kousari et al., 2013; Kim and Paik, 2015; Azorin-Molina et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Over the ocean, datasets demonstrate considerable disagreement in surface wind speed trends and spatial features (Kent et al., 2013). Global ocean surface winds from NOCv2.0 demonstrate upward trends of about 0.11 m s–1 per decade (1979–2015) with somewhat smaller trends from WASwind for 1979–2011 (Azorin-Molina et al., 2017, 2019). The trends are consistent until 1998, but diverge thereafter. Both ERA5 and JRA-55 reanalyses show consistently increasing global marine wind speeds over 1979–2015, though flattening since 2000, whereas MERRA-2 agrees until 1998, but then exhibits increased variability and an overall decrease in the last two decades (Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). This agrees with estimates by Sharmar et al. (2021) showing upward ocean wind trends from 1979 to 2000 which are consistent in ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2, but disagree with CFSR trends for the same period. Over 2000–2019 all reanalyses show diverging tendencies. An updated multiplatform satellite database (comprising data from altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers) from 1985–2018 shows small increases in mean wind speed over the global ocean, with the largest increase observed in the Southern Ocean (Young and Ribal, 2019), consistent with signals in ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2 (Sharmar et al., 2021). Overall, most products suggest positive trends over the Southern Ocean, western North Atlantic and the tropical eastern Pacific since the early 1980s."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"The modern era reanalyses exhibit SLP increases over the SH subtropics with stronger increases in austral winter over 1979–2018. Over the NH, SLP increased over the mid-latitude Pacific in boreal winter and decreased over the eastern subtropical and mid-latitude North Atlantic in boreal summer. Discrepancies in the low-frequency variations during the first half of the 20th century exist in the centennial-scale reanalysis products (Befort et al., 2016). Overall, modern reanalysis datasets support the AR5 conclusion that there is no clear signal for trends in the strength and position of the permanent and quasi-permanent pressure centres of action since the 1950s. Instead, they highlight multi-decadal variations. Large-scale SLP is strongly associated with the changes in modes of variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, since the 1970s a worldwide weakening of surface wind has likely occurred over land, particularly marked in the NH, with low confidence in a recent partial recovery since around 2010. Differences between available wind speed estimates lead to low confidence in trends over the global ocean as a whole but with most estimates showing strengthening globally over 1980–2000 and over the last four decades in the Southern Ocean, western North Atlantic and the tropical eastern Pacific."

Mitchell et al., 2013; Kretschmer et al., 2018). Errors in reanalysis stratospheric winds were assessed and discrepancies in stratospheric atmospheric circulation and temperatures between reanalyses, satellites and radiosondes have been reported (D.M.

wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"The northern stratospheric polar vortex has varied intra-seasonally and with altitude during recent decades. Multiple reanalysis and radiosonde datasets show that the midwinter lower stratospheric geopotential height (150 hPa) over the polar region north of 60°N has increased significantly since the early 1980s (Bohlinger et al., 2014; Garfinkel et al., 2017). This signal extends to the middle and upper stratosphere. In January-February zonal winds north of 60°N at 10 hPa have been weakening (Kim et al., 2014; Kretschmer et al., 2018). Daily atmospheric circulation patterns over the northern polar stratosphere exhibit a decreasing frequency of strong vortex events and commensurate increase in more-persistent weak events, which largely explains the observed significant weakening of the vortex during 1979–2015 (Kretschmer et al., 2018). The northern polar vortex has weakened in early winter but strengthened during late winter (Bohlinger et al., 2014; Garfinkel et al., 2015a, 2017; Ivy et al., 2016; Seviour, 2017; Kretschmer et al., 2018). In the middle and upper stratosphere, a strengthening trend of the northern polar vortex during DJF has occurred since 1998, contrasting the weakening trend beforehand (D. Hu et al., 2018). The position of the polar vortex also has long-term variations, exhibiting a persistent shift toward Northern Siberia and away from North America in February over the period 1979–2015 (Zhang et al., 2016; J. Zhang et al., 2018). Multiple measures show similar location changes (Seviour, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), a phenomenon of rapid stratospheric air temperature increases (sometimes by more than 50°C in 1–2 days), is tightly associated with the reversal of upper stratospheric zonal winds, and a resulting collapse or substantial weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex (Butler et al., 2015; Butler and Gerber, 2018) and on average occurs approximately 6 times per decade in the NH winter (Charlton et al., 2007; Butler et al., 2015). The SSW record from all modern reanalyses is very consistent. There is a higher occurrence of major midwinter SSWs in the 1980s and 2000s with no SSW events during 1990–1997 (Reichler et al., 2012; Butler et al., 2015). An assessment of multi-decadal variability and change in SSW events is sensitive to both chosen metric and methods (Palmeiro et al., 2015). Due to the lack of assimilation of upper air data, the centennial-scale reanalyses do not capture SSW events, even for the most recent decades (Butler et al., 2015, 2017) and hence cannot inform on earlier behaviour. There has been considerably less study of trends in the SH stratosphere polar vortex strength despite the interest in the ozone hole and the potential impact of the SH stratosphere polar vortex strength on it. The occurrence of SSW events in the SH is not as frequent as in the NH, with only 3 documented events in the last 40 years (Shen et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.1.4.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, it is likely  that the northern lower stratospheric polar vortex has weakened since the 1980s in midwinter, and its location has shifted more frequently toward the Eurasian continent. The short record and substantial decadal variability yields low confidence in any trends in the occurrence of SSW events in the NH winter and such events in the SH are rare."

A number of new products have also become available, including new datasets (e.g., Berkeley Earth, Rohde and Hausfather, 2020) and new interpolations based on existing datasets (e.g., Cowtan and Way, 2014 and Kadow et al., 2020). These various estimates are not fully independent."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Improvements in global temperature datasets since AR5 have addressed two major systematic issues. First, new SST datasets (Huang et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2019) address deficiencies previously identified in AR5 relating to the shift from predominantly ship-based to buoy-based measurements; these improvements result in larger warming trends, particularly in recent decades. Second, all datasets now employ interpolation to improve spatial coverage. This is particularly important in the Arctic, which has warmed faster than the rest of the globe in recent decades (Atlas 5.9.2.2); under-sampling of the Arctic leads to a cool bias in recent decades (Simmons et al., 2017; Benestad et al., 2019). Some datasets are now spatially complete (Cowtan and Way, 2014; Kadow et al., 2020) while others have expanded spatial coverage (Lenssen et al., 2019; Rohde and Hausfather, 2020; Morice et al., 2021; Vose et al., 2021). Several interpolation methods have been benchmarked against test cases (e.g., Lenssen et al., 2019), and comparisons with reanalyses further confirm the value of such interpolation (Simmons et al., 2017). It is extremely likely  that interpolation produces an improved estimate of the changes in GMST compared to ignoring data-void regions."

wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Each of the six years from 2015 to 2020 has likely been warmer than any prior year in the instrumental record.

A linear trend has become a poorer representation of observed change over time since most of the sustained warming has occurred after the 1970s (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Figure 1) and all values since 2012 are at least 0.2°C above a linear trendline for 1850–2020. For this reason, the primary method used to assess observed warming in this report is the change in temperature from 1850–1900 to the most recent decade (2011–2020) or the recent past (1995–2014), replacing the trend-based methods used in AR5 and earlier assessments. The effect of this change from trend-based to change-based metrics is currently relatively minor at –0.03°C (<5%) for the most recent decade, but this may not remain the case in future (high confidence)."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"AR5 used 1850–1900 as an approximate pre-industrial baseline for global temperature change, whilst using an earlier pre-industrial baseline of 1750 for radiative forcings. Cross-Chapter Box 1.2 assesses that there was an observed GMST change from the period around 1750 to 1850–1900 of around 0.1°C (likely range –0.1 to +0.3°C, medium confidence). This additional global temperature change before 1850–1900 is not included when making AR6 assessments on global warming to date, global temperature threshold crossing times, or remaining carbon budgets to ensure consistency with previous ARs."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p14,NO_TITLE,"GMST is a combination of land surface air temperatures (LSAT) and SSTs, whereas GSAT is a combination of LSAT and marine air temperatures (MATs). Although GMST and GSAT are closely related, the two measures are physically distinct. The implications have become more apparent since AR5 (Merchant et al., 2013; Cowtan et al., 2015; Simmons et al., 2017; IPCC, 2018 (SR1.5); Richardson et al., 2018), and it has been shown (Rubino et al., 2020) that MAT and SST can show distinct multi-decadal-scale trends and patterns of interannual variability. Although SR1.5 used GMST for observational-based and GSAT for model-based headline warming statements, they noted the importance of the difference for their assessment (SR1.5Section 1.2.1.1). The SR1.5 used information from CMIP5 models to estimate a GSAT equivalent from observation-based GMST for certain applications such as remaining carbon budgets. The following subsections assess available lines of evidence related to the equivalence between GMST and GSAT."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p16,NO_TITLE,"A well-understood physical constraint on the vertical gradient between the air and sea surface temperature is that it is approximately proportional to the turbulent sensible heat flux in the atmospheric surface layer (Chor et al., 2020). Similarly, the latent heat flux scales with the vertical humidity gradient and, in the global mean and in most oceanic regions, the latent heat flux is substantially larger than the sensible heat flux (Sections 7.2.1 and 9.2.1.3). If GSAT were to warm faster than GMST, the sensible surface heat flux would respond so as to reduce this difference. However, it is the sum of the sensible, latent, and radiative heat fluxes that controls GMST, so the sensible heat flux effect cannot be considered in isolation. Attempts to further constrain the combination of fluxes (e.g., Lorenz et al., 2010; Siler et al., 2019) rely on parameterizations or output from Earth system models (ESMs) or reanalyses and so are not considered independent. Apart from the above global considerations, regional and seasonal effects such as changes to the frequency and intensity of storms, sea state, cloudiness, sea ice cover, vegetation and land use may all affect the GSAT to GMST difference, either directly or by altering the relationships between gradients and energy fluxes. These changing energy flux relationships are monitored through observing the stratification of the upper ocean (Section 9.2.1.3) and the response of upper ocean processes (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3) in ESMs and reanalyses, but such monitoring tasks rival the observational challenge of directly observing SSTs and 2 m air temperature under a wide range of conditions. In summary, because of the lack of physical constraints and the complexity of processes driving changes in the GSAT to GMST temperature differences, there is no simple explanation based on physical grounds alone for how this difference responds to climate change."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p18,NO_TITLE,"There is currently no regularly updated, entirely observation-based dataset for GSAT. The best available observations of near-surface air temperature over ocean are datasets of night-time marine air temperature (NMAT; e.g., Cornes et al., 2020; Junod and Christy, 2020), though spatial coverage is less extensive than for SST. Night-time measurements are used to avoid potential biases from daytime heating of ship superstructures. Kennedy et al. (2019) show little difference between HadNMAT2 and HadSST4 between 1920 and 1990, but a warming of SST relative to NMAT manifesting as a step change of 0.05°C–0.10°C in the early 1990s, which may reflect an actual change, the impact of increasingly divergent spatial coverage between SST and MAT measurements, or unresolved structural uncertainties in one or both datasets. This leads to NMAT warming around 10% more slowly than SST over the last century. In contrast, Junod and Christy (2020) find NMAT trends which are 8–17% larger than those for SST in the ERSSTv4 and HadISST datasets for the period 1900 to 2010, but 11–15% smaller than the SST trends for the same datasets from 1979 to 2010. However, ERSSTv4 uses NMAT data as a basis for homogeneity adjustment so is not fully independent. Kent and Kennedy (2021) note sensitivity to methodological choices in comparisons but find that NMAT is warming more slowly than SST products over most periods considered. Rubino et al. (2020) exploit tropical Pacific moored buoy arrays, available since the early 1980s, and find differences in NMAT and SST anomalies, which are sensitive to the choice of period and show spatio-temporal ENSO-related (Annex IV) signals in the differences."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p19,NO_TITLE,"Overall, with medium evidence and low agreement, available observational products suggest that NMAT is warming less than SST by up to 15%. Given that these ocean observations cover roughly two thirds of the globe, this implies that GMST is warming up to at most 10% faster than GSAT. Substantial uncertainty remains and the effect is highly sensitive to the choice of both time period and choice of NMAT and SST observational products to compare. Observed NMAT warming faster than observed SST cannot be precluded."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p21,NO_TITLE,"CMIP historical simulations and projections agree that GSAT increases faster than GMST, the reverse of what is indicated by many marine observations. Several studies approximate the approach used to derive GMST from observations by blending SST over open ocean and SAT over land and sea ice from model output (Cowtan et al., 2015; Richardson et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Cowtan et al. found that trends in GSAT are of the order of 9% larger than for GMST in CMIP5, based on data from 1850–2100 (historical + RCP8.5), if anomalies are blended and sea ice is allowed to vary over time (Cowtan et al., 2015). Broadly consistent numbers are found for both CMIP5 and CMIP6, across a range of SSP and RCP scenarios and time periods (Richardson et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Blending monthly anomalies and allowing sea ice to vary, the change in GSAT for 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900 is 2–8% larger than spatially-complete GMST in CMIP6 historical and SSP2-4.5 simulations (Gillett et al., 2021), and 6–12% larger in CMIP5 historical and RCP2.6 and 8.5 simulations for 2007–2016 relative to 1861–1880 (Richardson et al., 2018). However, a true like-for-like comparison to observational products is challenging because methodological choices have a large impact on the relationship between modelled GMST and GSAT and none of these studies fully reproduces the methods used to derive estimates of GMST in recent observational datasets, which use various ways to infill areas lacking in situ observations (Jones, 2020)."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p22,NO_TITLE,"Marine boundary layer behaviour and parameterizations in all CMIP models are based upon Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (e.g., Businger et al., 1971), which informs assumptions around gradients in the near-surface boundary layer dependent upon temperature, wind speed and humidity. This leaves open the possibility of a common model bias, while Druzhinin et al. (2019) also point to departures of temperature profiles from theoretical predictions under certain conditions. There remain inadequacies in understanding and modelling of key processes (Edwards et al., 2020), and biases in the representation of the absolute SST-MAT difference have been identified in climate models and reanalyses (Găinuşă-Bogdan et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020)."

(2017) found that in JRA-55 and ERA-Interim (following an adjustment to account for an apparent discontinuity), GSAT increased 2–4% faster than GMST over the period 1979–2016. In atmospheric reanalyses, SST is given as a lower boundary condition from an observed globally interpolated product (such as HadISST; Rayner et al., 2003) whereas the air temperature is reliant upon model parameterizations and assimilated observations that do not include MAT observations (Simmons et al., 2017), thereby limiting their capability to constrain differences in GMST and GSAT trends. Furthermore, it is unclear what the lack of dynamic coupling at the ocean-atmosphere interface might imply for the representativeness of reanalysis-based estimates."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p26,NO_TITLE,"There is a significant issue in areas where sea ice melts or grows, where the quantity used in observational-based GMST estimates switches between air temperature and sea surface temperature. This primarily affects analyses combining SAT anomalies over land and ice with SST anomalies over ocean. In areas where sea ice has recently melted, the climatological value changes from an air-temperature based estimate to an SST estimate based upon the freezing point of seawater (–1.8°C). This switch in climatology to, in general, a warmer climatology, leads to a bias towards reduced warming in anomalies compared with analyses based on absolute temperatures. Richardson et al. (2018) found this underestimation to amount to approximately 3% of observed warming in historical model simulations. Given the projected future sea ice losses, the effect will grow in future (low confidence), with potential effects of the order of 0.1°C in the second half of the 21st century under high warming scenarios, although with some uncertainty arising from the large spread of sea ice loss in model projections (Tokarska et al., 2019)."

The very likely range of estimated historical GMST warming is combined with the assessed ± 10% uncertainty in the relationship between GMST and GSAT changes to infer a GSAT equivalent, accounting for any possible real-world physical difference.

wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p35,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 assessed estimate for historical warming between 1850–1900 and 1986–2005 is 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C. The equivalent in AR6 is 0.69 [0.54 to 0.79] °C, and the 0.08 [-0.01 to 0.12] °C difference is an estimate of the contribution of changes in observational understanding alone (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1). The exact value of this contribution depends upon the metric being compared (GMST/GSAT, the method used to calculate a trend or change between two periods, the exact reference period used), with the best estimates (with the exception of the SR1.5 GSAT estimate) falling between 0.07°C and 0.12°C. The choice of 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 as the basis is due to the widespread use of this period across AR5 and SR1.5 in several contexts. The AR6-assessed GMST warming between 1850–1900 and 2011–2020 is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C. An AR5-equivalent assessment using this estimated difference in observational understanding is thus 1.01 [0.94 to 1.08] °C. These updates and improvements in observational datasets affect other quantities that derive from the assessment of GSAT warming, including estimates of remaining carbon budgets and estimates of crossing times of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (see Cross Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1)."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p37,NO_TITLE,"The updated estimate of historical warming is one contribution to the revised time of projected crossing of the threshold of 1.5°C global warming in comparison with SR1.5, but is not the only reason for this update. The AR6 assessment of future change in GSAT (Table 4.5) results in the following threshold-crossing times, based on 20-year moving averages. The threshold-crossing time is defined as the midpoint of the first 20-year period during which the average GSAT exceeds the threshold. During the near term (2021–2040), a 1.5°C GSAT increase relative to the average over the period 1850–1900 is very likely  to occur in scenario SSP5-8.5, likely  to occur in scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and more likely than not  to occur in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of crossing the 1.5°C global warming level lies in the early 2030s. This is in the early part of the likely range (2030–2052) assessed in SR1.5, which assumed continuation of the then-reported warming rate; this estimated rate has been confirmed in AR6 (Section 3.3.1). Roughly half of this difference arises from the higher diagnosed historical warming in AR6. The other half arises because, for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near term than was assessed as ‘current’ in SR1.5 (medium confidence). When considering scenarios similar to SSP1-1.9 instead of linear extrapolation, the SR1.5 estimate of when 1.5°C global warming is crossed is close to the central estimate reported here (SR1.5, Table 2.SM.12)."

AR6 undertakes three changes to this approach. First, the AR6 assessment of improved observational records is used. Second, the recent past baseline period is updated from 1986–2005 to 1995–2014, and, third, historical estimates are expressed in GSAT instead of GMST for consistency of historical estimates with future projections. The updated estimates of warming to date in AR6 lead to higher estimates of future warming, all else being equal. The temperature classification of emissions scenarios in the WGIII report adopts the definition of temperature classes as introduced in SR1.5, and assigns emissions scenarios to these classes based on their AR6 assessed GSAT outcomes (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1; WGIII Annex C.II.2.4)."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p40,NO_TITLE,"In both AR5 and SR1.5, remaining carbon budgets were expressed as a function of GSAT warming, while also highlighting the implications of using historical warming estimates expressed in GMST. The AR5 reported total carbon budgets for GSAT warming relative to 1861–1880. The AR5 Synthesis Report (SYR) also includes remaining carbon budget estimates based on AR5 WGIII scenario projections that use the method for AR5 scenario projections described above. The SR1.5 integrated several methodological advancements to estimate remaining carbon budgets and reported budgets for additional GSAT warming since the 2006–2015 period, estimating, following the application of an adjustment (Richardson et al., 2016, Table 1.1, SR1.5) to GMST, that 0.97°C (± 0.12°C) of GSAT warming occurred historically between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015. The AR6 assessment, above, leads to an estimate of 0.94°C of warming between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015. All other factors considered equal, the AR6 estimate thus implies that 0.03°C more warming is considered for remaining carbon budgets compared to SR1.5. Combining this 0.03°C value with the SR1.5 transient climate response to cumulative emissions of CO2 (TCRE) translates into remaining carbon budgets about 70 [40–140] GtCO2 larger compared to SR1.5 on a like-for-like basis. Meanwhile, on the same like-for-like basis, updates to historical observational products would reduce remaining carbon budgets reported in AR5 SYR based on WGIII scenario projections by about 180 [120 to 370] GtCO2. Box 5.2 provides a further overview of updates to estimates of the remaining carbon budget since AR5."

The implications are mainly that the level of warming associated with a particular impact has been revised. This has very limited practical implications for the assessment of the benefits of limiting global warming to specific levels, as well as for the urgency of adaptation action. For example, impacts that occurred in the period 1986–2005 were previously associated with a GMST increase of 0.61°C relative to 1850–1900, relative to AR5 estimates. These impacts are now instead associated with a GMST increase of 0.69°C, relative to the assessment in this Report. The impacts themselves have not changed. Similarly, the impacts previously associated with a GMST or GSAT increase of 1.5°C will now generally be associated with a slightly different global warming level. This is because projections of future warming and its impacts relative to 1850–1900 are normally made by adding projected warming from a recent past baseline to an estimate of the observed warming from 1850–1900, as in AR5 and SR1.5."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.3_p43,NO_TITLE,"Most of the previously projected impacts and risks associated with global warming of 1.5°C have therefore not changed and are still associated with the same level of future warming (0.89°C) relative to 1986–2005.

Similarly, the impacts now associated with 1.5°C warming would have previously been associated with 1.42°C warming. There are exceptions where impacts studies have used a baseline earlier than 1986–2005 (e.g., King et al., 2017), for which the new estimate of the historical warming would mean an earlier occurrence of the projected impacts. However, even in these cases, the ostensible difference in impacts associated with a 0.08°C difference in global mean temperature will be small in comparison with the uncertainties. There are also substantial uncertainties in regional climate changes and the magnitude of climate impact-drivers projected to occur with global warming of 1.5°C (Betts et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2018). Furthermore, the time of reaching global warming of 1.5°C is subject to uncertainties of approximately ±10 years associated with uncertainties in climate sensitivity, and ±3 to 4 years associated with the different SSP forcing scenarios (Section 4.3.4, Table 4.5, and see discussion above)."

A record-low Arctic SIA since the start of the satellite era (1979) occurred in September 2012 (Figure 2.20a).

Most of this decline in SIA has occurred after 2000, and is superimposed by substantial interannual variability. The sharp decline in Arctic summer SIA coincides with earlier surface melt onset (Mortin et al., 2016; Bliss et al., 2017), later freeze-up, and thus a longer ice retreat and open water period (Stammerjohn et al., 2012; Parkinson, 2014; Peng et al., 2018)."

The loss of older ice is indicative of a thinning overall of ice cover (Tschudi et al., 2016), but also the remaining older ice has become thinner (E. Hansen et al., 2013). Since in situ ice thickness measurements are sparse, information about ice thickness is mainly based on airborne and satellite surveys. Records from a combination of different platforms show for the central and western Arctic Ocean (Arctic Ocean north of Canada and Alaska) negative trends since the mid-1970s (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015; Kwok, 2018), with a particularly rapid decline during the 2000s, which coincided with a large loss of multiyear sea ice. Direct observations from 2004 and 2017 indicate a decrease of modal ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland by 0.75 m, but with little thinning between 2014 and 2017 (Haas et al., 2017). This agrees with data based on satellite altimetry and airborne observations, showing no discernible thickness trend since 2010 (Kwok and Cunningham, 2015; Kwok, 2018; Kwok and Kacimi, 2018; see Figure 2.21). However, sea-ice thickness derived from airborne and spaceborne data is still subject to uncertainties imposed by snow loading. For radar altimeters, insufficient penetration of radar signal into the snowpack results in overestimation of ice thickness (e.g., Ricker et al., 2015; King et al., 2018; Nandan et al., 2020). Negative trends in ice thickness since the 1990s are also reported from the Fram Strait in the Greenland Sea, and north of Svalbard (E. Hansen et al., 2013; Renner et al., 2014; King et al., 2018; Rösel et al., 2018; Spreen et al., 2020). Thickness data collected in the Fram Strait originate from ice exported from the interior of the Arctic Basin and are representative of a larger geographical area upstream in the transpolar drift. A reduction of survival rates of sea ice exported from the Siberian shelves by 15% per decade has interrupted the transpolar drift and affected the long-range transport of sea ice (Krumpen et al., 2019). The thinner and on average younger ice has less resistance to dynamic forcing, resulting in a more dynamic ice cover (Hakkinen et al., 2008; Spreen et al., 2011; Vihma et al., 2012; Kwok et al., 2013)."

Recent observations indicate a substantial thinning of the spring snowpack in the western Arctic (Cavalieri et al., 2012; Brucker and Markus, 2013; Kurtz et al., 2013; Laxon et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2018). In contrast, thick snow over Arctic sea ice in the Atlantic sector north of Svalbard (snow thickness around 0.4 m or more) has been observed in the 1970s and since the 1990s (Rösel et al., 2018), but data are too sparse to detect trends."

Arctic sea ice has become younger, thinner and faster moving (very high confidence). Snow thickness on sea ice has decreased in the western Arctic Ocean (medium confidence).

The SROCC noted that a significant positive trend in mean annual sea ice cover between 1979 and 2015 had not persisted, due to three consecutive years of below-average sea ice cover (2016–2018). The SROCC stated also that historical Antarctic sea ice data from different sources indicated a decrease in overall Antarctic sea ice cover since the early 1960s, but was too small to be separated from natural variability (high confidence)."

Proxies from marine sediments for intervals preceding and following the MPWP indicate open water conditions with less sea ice than modern conditions (Taylor-Silva and Riesselman, 2018; Ishino and Suto, 2020). During the LGM, proxies indicate that austral winter sea ice coverage reached the polar ocean front (e.g., Nair et al., 2019). More recently, sea ice coverage appears to have fluctuated substantially throughout the Holocene (e.g., for the western Amundsen Sea, Lamping et al., 2020). At the beginning of the CE, regional summer sea ice coverage in the north-western Ross Sea was lower than today (Tesi et al., 2020). Crosta et al.

These reconstructions, in combination with recent satellite-based observations indicate: (i) a decrease in summer SIE across all Antarctic sectors since the early- to mid-20th century; (ii) a decrease in winter SIE in the East Antarctic and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas sectors starting in the 1960s; and (iii) small fluctuations in winter SIE in the Weddell Sea over the 20th century (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b). There are also ice-core indications that the pronounced Ross Sea increase dates back to the mid-1960s (Sinclair et al., 2014; Thomas and Abram, 2016). While there is reasonable broad-scale concurrence across these estimates, the uncertainties are large, there is considerable interannual variability, and reconstructions require further validation (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b). New reconstructions (Thomas et al., 2019) from Antarctic land ice cores show that SIE in the Ross Sea had increased between 1900 and 1990, while the Bellingshausen Sea had experienced a decline in SIE; this dipole pattern is consistent with satellite-based observations from 1979 to 2019 (Parkinson, 2019), but the recent rate of change then has been larger. Records of Antarctic SIE for the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Edinburgh and Day, 2016), show SIE comparable with the satellite era, although with marked spatial heterogeneity (e.g., Thomas et al., 2019)."

The continuous satellite passive-microwave record shows that there was a modest increase in overall Antarctic SIA of 2.5% ± 0.2% per decade (1 standard error over 1979–2015; Comiso et al., 2017). For overall ice coverage and for this period, positive long-term trends were most pronounced during austral autumn advance (Maksym, 2019), being moderate in summer and winter, and lowest in spring (Holland, 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Hobbs et al., 2016a, b; Comiso et al., 2017). Since 2014, overall Antarctic SIE (and SIA) has exhibited major fluctuations from record-high to record-low satellite era extents (Massonnet et al., 2015; Reid and Massom, 2015; Reid et al., 2015; Comiso et al., 2017; Parkinson, 2019). After setting record-high extents each September from 2012 through 2014, Antarctic SIE (and SIA) dipped rapidly in mid-2016 and remained predominantly below average through 2019 (Reid et al., 2020). For the most recent decade of observations (2010–2019), the decadal means of three SIA products (Figure 2.20b) were 2.17 million km2 for February and 15.75 million km2 for September, respectively. The corresponding levels for the means for the first decade of recordings (1979–1988) were 2.04 million km2 for February and 15.39 million km2 for September indicating little overall change. Initial SIA data for 2020 (OSISAF) show SIA for September above, and for February slightly below the recent decadal means (Figure 2.20b).

The limited pre-satellite era data does not allow for a similar assessment for the entire spring-summer period. Assessment of SCE trends in the NH since 1978 indicates that for the October to February period there is substantial uncertainty in trends with the sign dependent on the observational product. Analysis using the NOAA Climate Data Record shows an increase in October to February SCE (Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015; Kunkel et al., 2016) while analyses based on satellite borne optical sensors (Hori et al., 2017) or multi-observation products (Mudryk et al., 2020) show a negative trend for all seasons (Section 9.5.3.1 and Figure 9.23). The greatest declines in SCE have occurred during boreal spring and summer, although the estimated magnitude is dataset dependent (Rupp et al., 2013; Estilow et al., 2015; Bokhorst et al., 2016; Thackeray et al., 2016; Connolly et al., 2019)."

The former shows that glaciers retreated during the LDT and retracted to their minimum extent between 8 ka and 6 ka. Except for some glaciers in the SH and tropics, glaciers expanded thereafter, reaching their maximum extent beyond their present-day margins during the mid-15th to late 19th centuries CE. With few exceptions, glacier margins worldwide have retreated since the 19th century, with the rate of retreat and its global character since the late 20th century being unusual in the context of the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2016, Figure 2.23a). However, the areal extents of modern glaciers in most places in the NH are still larger than those of the early and/or middle Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015). When considering Holocene and present glaciers extents, it is important to account for the relatively long adjustment time of glaciers (often referred to as response time; Section 9.5.1.3); the majority of modern glaciers are currently out of equilibrium with current climate, even without further global warming (Mernild et al., 2013; Christian et al., 2018; Marzeion et al., 2018; Zekollari et al., 2020). The size of glaciers during other periods warmer than the Early to Mid-Holocene, such as the MPWP and LIG, is largely unknown because the deposits marking previous extents were in almost all cases over-ridden by later glaciations. For Arctic glaciers, different regional studies consistently indicate that in many places glaciers are now smaller than they have been in millennia (Lowell et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2013, 2017; Harning et al., 2016, 2018; Schweinsberg et al., 2017, 2018; Pendleton et al., 2019)."

Observations are in general consistent with trends revealed by global glacier mass change modelling for almost the entire 20th century (1901–1990) implying an estimated mass loss (without uncharted glaciers (Parkes and Marzeion, 2018) and excluding peripheral glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica) of very likely 210 ± 90 Gt yr–1 and very likely 170 ± 80 Gt yr–1 for the period 1971–2019 (Marzeion et al., 2015; Section 9.5.1 and Table 9.5)."

Oscillations over the past 7.5 Myr, including the Pliocene and through the glacial – interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene are not well-constrained, but most studies indicate that Greenland was at least partially glaciated over this time with extended periods when it was predominantly deglaciated (Bierman et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016). Geological evidence and modelling studies suggest periods of glacial intensification during the Pliocene at 4.9 Myr, 4.0 Myr, 3.6 Myr and 3.3 Myr (De Schepper et al., 2014; Bierman et al., 2016; Bachem et al., 2017). Retreat of the GrIS occurred during the MPWP and GrIS extent was reduced compared to today with some studies suggesting that the ice sheet was limited to the highest elevations (De Schepper et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2015; Haywood et al., 2016; Blake-Mizen et al., 2019). There is apparent glacial intensification following the MPWP, 2.75–2.72 Myr (Nielsen and Kuijpers, 2013; De Schepper et al., 2014; Blake-Mizen et al., 2019; Knutz et al., 2019). Several studies agree that during the LIG the total GrIS extent was likely less than present day (Section 9.4.1, Figure 9.17) with the total mass loss ranging from 0.3–6.2 m sea level equivalent (SLE), although timing and magnitude of this mass loss are not well constrained (Helsen et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2013; Vasskog et al., 2015; Goelzer et al., 2016; Sinclair et al., 2016; Yau et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2020). During the LGM, the GrIS reached a peak ice volume greater than present (2–5 m SLE), as revealed by the limited number of available geological records (Simpson et al., 2009; Lecavalier et al., 2014; Batchelor et al., 2019)."

It is probable that its total volume during 8–3 ka was smaller than today (Larsen et al., 2015; Young and Briner, 2015; Briner et al., 2016), but uncertainties exist regarding precisely when the minimum MH extent and volume was reached, due to uncertainties in reconstructions.

Based on physical understanding, paleo evidence and numerical simulations, it is very likely  that the AIS has been smaller than today during at least some past warm climates (such as MCO and LIG), in particular the WAIS (Figure 9.18; Golledge et al., 2014; de Boer et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Levy et al., 2016).

Marine sediments indicate that during the Pleistocene repeated ungrounding and loss of large marine-based parts of the AIS occurred during interglacial periods, with at least seven transitions between floating and grounded ice in the Ross Sea during the last 780 kyr (McKay et al., 2012) and at least three reductions in ice volume in the Wilkes Basin during the last 500 kyr (Wilson et al., 2018).

Geophysical imaging indicates a readvance in this area around 6 ± 2 ka (Wearing and Kingslake, 2019). Other studies from the region conclude that ice-sheet retreat and thinning was fastest from 9 to 8 ka (Johnson et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2016; Spector et al., 2017), or millennia later, during the MH (Hein et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2019), with indications of a subsequent readvance (Venturelli et al., 2020). In East Antarctica, rapid ice-sheet thinning occurred between around 9 and 5 ka (Jones et al., 2015), consistent with previous work indicating that the ice sheet in many regions was at or close to its current position by 5 ka (Bentley et al., 2014).

For the period 1979–2000, an insignificant Antarctic-wide negative SMB trend has been estimated (Medley and Thomas, 2019). The Antarctic Ice Sheet lost 2670 [1800 to 3540]Gt (SLE 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]mm) of ice between 1992 and 2020.

Within quantified uncertainties, this estimate agrees with other recent estimates (Rignot et al., 2019; B. Smith et al., 2020; Velicogna et al., 2020). There is therefore very high confidence that the AIS has been losing mass over 1992–2020 (Section 9.4.2.1 and Figure 2.24). Major contributions to recent AIS changes arise from West Antarctica and Wilkes Land in East Antarctica (Rignot et al., 2019). For the East Antarctic most studies suggest that the mass balance is not significantly different from zero (Bamber et al., 2018; IMBIE Consortium, 2018; Mohajerani et al., 2018; Rignot et al., 2019)."

wg1_ch02_2.3.2.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Permafrost occurrence during the Pliocene has been inferred from pollen in lake sediments in NE Arctic Russia and permafrost-vegetation relationships which indicate that permafrost was absent during the MPWP in this region (Brigham-Grette et al., 2013; Herzschuh et al., 2016). Analysis of speleothem records in Siberian caves, indicates that permafrost was absent in the current continuous permafrost zone at 60°N at the start of the 1.5 Ma record, with aggradation occurring around 0.4 Ma (Vaks et al., 2020). There are indications of extensive permafrost thaw during subsequent interglacials especially further south in the current permafrost zone (Vaks et al., 2013). Reconstruction of permafrost distribution during the LGM indicates that permafrost was more extensive in exposed areas (Vandenberghe et al., 2014). In non-glaciated areas of the North American Arctic there is permafrost that survived the LIG (French and Millar, 2014). Trends and timing of permafrost aggradation and thaw over the last 6 kyr in peatlands of the NH were recently summarized (Hiemstra, 2018; Treat and Jones, 2018). Three multi-century periods (ending 1000 Before the Common Era (BCE), 500 CE and 1850 CE) of permafrost aggradation, associated with neoglaciation periods are inferred resulting in more extensive permafrost in peatlands of the present-day discontinuous permafrost zone, which reached a peak approximately 250 years ago, with thawing occurring concurrently with post 1850 warming (Treat and Jones, 2018). Although permafrost persists in peatlands at the southern extent of the permafrost zone where it was absent prior to 3 ka, there has been thawing since the 1960s (James et al., 2013; B.M. Jones et al., 2016; Holloway and Lewkowicz, 2020)."

Recent (2018–2019) permafrost temperatures in the upper 20–30 m layer (at depths where seasonal variation is minimal) were the highest ever directly observed at most sites (Romanovsky et al., 2020), with temperatures in colder permafrost of northern North America being more than 1°C higher than they were in 1978. Increases in temperature of colder Arctic permafrost are larger (average 0.4°C–0.6°C per decade) than for warmer (temperature >–2°C) permafrost (average 0.17°C per decade) of sub-Arctic regions (Figures 2.25, 9.22)."

Although ALT decreased over the following few years, it has generally increased again since the late 2000s (Duchesne et al., 2015; Romanovsky et al., 2017b, 2020). However, at some sites there has been little change in ALT due to ground subsidence that accompanies thaw of ice-rich permafrost (Streletskiy et al., 2017; O’Neill et al., 2019). In the European and Russian Arctic there has been a broad-scale increase in ALT during the 21st century (Streletskiy et al., 2015; Romanovsky et al., 2020).

Sea-ice charts since 1850 (Walsh et al., 2017, 2019) suggest that there was no significant trend before the 1990s, but the uncertainty of these estimates is large and could mask a trend, a possibility illustrated by Brennan et al.

wg1_ch02_2.3.2.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"There has been a continuing decline in SIE and Arctic sea ice area (SIA) in recent years (Figure 2.20a). To reduce grid-geometry associated biases and uncertainties (Notz, 2014; Ivanova et al., 2016; Meier and Stewart, 2019) SIA is used in addition to, or instead of SIE herein (see also section 9.3.1). A record-low Arctic SIA since the start of the satellite era (1979) occurred in September 2012 (Figure 2.20a). Decadal SIA means based on the average of three different satellite products decreased from 6.23 to 3.76 million km2 for September and 14.52 to 13.42 million km2 for March SIA (Figure 2.20a). Initial SIA data for 2020 (OSISAF) are within the range of these recent decadal means or slightly below (Figure 2.20a). SIA has declined since 1979 across the seasonal cycle (Figure 9.13). Most of this decline in SIA has occurred after 2000, and is superimposed by substantial interannual variability. The sharp decline in Arctic summer SIA coincides with earlier surface melt onset (Mortin et al., 2016; Bliss et al., 2017), later freeze-up, and thus a longer ice retreat and open water period (Stammerjohn et al., 2012; Parkinson, 2014; Peng et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.2.1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Over the past two decades, first-year sea ice has become more dominant and the oldest multiyear ice (older than 4 years) which in March 1985 made up 33% of the Arctic sea-ice cover, has nearly disappeared, making up 1.2% in March 2019 (Perovich et al., 2020). The loss of older ice is indicative of a thinning overall of ice cover (Tschudi et al., 2016), but also the remaining older ice has become thinner (E. Hansen et al., 2013). Since in situ ice thickness measurements are sparse, information about ice thickness is mainly based on airborne and satellite surveys. Records from a combination of different platforms show for the central and western Arctic Ocean (Arctic Ocean north of Canada and Alaska) negative trends since the mid-1970s (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015; Kwok, 2018), with a particularly rapid decline during the 2000s, which coincided with a large loss of multiyear sea ice. Direct observations from 2004 and 2017 indicate a decrease of modal ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland by 0.75 m, but with little thinning between 2014 and 2017 (Haas et al., 2017). This agrees with data based on satellite altimetry and airborne observations, showing no discernible thickness trend since 2010 (Kwok and Cunningham, 2015; Kwok, 2018; Kwok and Kacimi, 2018; see Figure 2.21). However, sea-ice thickness derived from airborne and spaceborne data is still subject to uncertainties imposed by snow loading. For radar altimeters, insufficient penetration of radar signal into the snowpack results in overestimation of ice thickness (e.g., Ricker et al., 2015; King et al., 2018; Nandan et al., 2020). Negative trends in ice thickness since the 1990s are also reported from the Fram Strait in the Greenland Sea, and north of Svalbard (E. Hansen et al., 2013; Renner et al., 2014; King et al., 2018; Rösel et al., 2018; Spreen et al., 2020). Thickness data collected in the Fram Strait originate from ice exported from the interior of the Arctic Basin and are representative of a larger geographical area upstream in the transpolar drift. A reduction of survival rates of sea ice exported from the Siberian shelves by 15% per decade has interrupted the transpolar drift and affected the long-range transport of sea ice (Krumpen et al., 2019). The thinner and on average younger ice has less resistance to dynamic forcing, resulting in a more dynamic ice cover (Hakkinen et al., 2008; Spreen et al., 2011; Vihma et al., 2012; Kwok et al., 2013)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.2.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"The SROCC noted the lack of continuous records of snow on sea ice. Nevertheless in recent decades, more snow on sea ice has been observed in the Atlantic sector in the Arctic than in the western Arctic Ocean (Webster et al., 2018). Previously, Warren et al. (1999) showed that over 1954–1991 there were weak trends towards declining snow depth on sea ice in the Pacific sector. Recent observations indicate a substantial thinning of the spring snowpack in the western Arctic (Cavalieri et al., 2012; Brucker and Markus, 2013; Kurtz et al., 2013; Laxon et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2018). In contrast, thick snow over Arctic sea ice in the Atlantic sector north of Svalbard (snow thickness around 0.4 m or more) has been observed in the 1970s and since the 1990s (Rösel et al., 2018), but data are too sparse to detect trends."

Proxies from marine sediments for intervals preceding and following the MPWP indicate open water conditions with less sea ice than modern conditions (Taylor-Silva and Riesselman, 2018; Ishino and Suto, 2020). During the LGM, proxies indicate that austral winter sea ice coverage reached the polar ocean front (e.g., Nair et al., 2019). More recently, sea ice coverage appears to have fluctuated substantially throughout the Holocene (e.g., for the western Amundsen Sea, Lamping et al., 2020). At the beginning of the CE, regional summer sea ice coverage in the north-western Ross Sea was lower than today (Tesi et al., 2020). Crosta et al. (2021) suggest, based on different proxies, four different phases with 7–10 months periods of sea ice occurrence per year in the Antarctic region off Adelie Land during the CE, where each phase was several hundred years long."

These reconstructions, in combination with recent satellite-based observations indicate: (i) a decrease in summer SIE across all Antarctic sectors since the early- to mid-20th century; (ii) a decrease in winter SIE in the East Antarctic and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas sectors starting in the 1960s; and (iii) small fluctuations in winter SIE in the Weddell Sea over the 20th century (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b). There are also ice-core indications that the pronounced Ross Sea increase dates back to the mid-1960s (Sinclair et al., 2014; Thomas and Abram, 2016). While there is reasonable broad-scale concurrence across these estimates, the uncertainties are large, there is considerable interannual variability, and reconstructions require further validation (Hobbs et al., 2016a, b). New reconstructions (Thomas et al., 2019) from Antarctic land ice cores show that SIE in the Ross Sea had increased between 1900 and 1990, while the Bellingshausen Sea had experienced a decline in SIE; this dipole pattern is consistent with satellite-based observations from 1979 to 2019 (Parkinson, 2019), but the recent rate of change then has been larger.

The continuous satellite passive-microwave record shows that there was a modest increase in overall Antarctic SIA of 2.5% ± 0.2% per decade (1 standard error over 1979–2015; Comiso et al., 2017). For overall ice coverage and for this period, positive long-term trends were most pronounced during austral autumn advance (Maksym, 2019), being moderate in summer and winter, and lowest in spring (Holland, 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Hobbs et al., 2016a, b; Comiso et al., 2017). Since 2014, overall Antarctic SIE (and SIA) has exhibited major fluctuations from record-high to record-low satellite era extents (Massonnet et al., 2015; Reid and Massom, 2015; Reid et al., 2015; Comiso et al., 2017; Parkinson, 2019). After setting record-high extents each September from 2012 through 2014, Antarctic SIE (and SIA) dipped rapidly in mid-2016 and remained predominantly below average through 2019 (Reid et al., 2020).

Initial SIA data for 2020 (OSISAF) show SIA for September above, and for February slightly below the recent decadal means (Figure 2.20b).

The limited pre-satellite era data does not allow for a similar assessment for the entire spring-summer period. Assessment of SCE trends in the NH since 1978 indicates that for the October to February period there is substantial uncertainty in trends with the sign dependent on the observational product. Analysis using the NOAA Climate Data Record shows an increase in October to February SCE (Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015; Kunkel et al., 2016) while analyses based on satellite borne optical sensors (Hori et al., 2017) or multi-observation products (Mudryk et al., 2020) show a negative trend for all seasons (Section 9.5.3.1 and Figure 9.23).

The former shows that glaciers retreated during the LDT and retracted to their minimum extent between 8 ka and 6 ka. Except for some glaciers in the SH and tropics, glaciers expanded thereafter, reaching their maximum extent beyond their present-day margins during the mid-15th to late 19th centuries CE. With few exceptions, glacier margins worldwide have retreated since the 19th century, with the rate of retreat and its global character since the late 20th century being unusual in the context of the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2016, Figure 2.23a). However, the areal extents of modern glaciers in most places in the NH are still larger than those of the early and/or middle Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015). When considering Holocene and present glaciers extents, it is important to account for the relatively long adjustment time of glaciers (often referred to as response time; Section 9.5.1.3); the majority of modern glaciers are currently out of equilibrium with current climate, even without further global warming (Mernild et al., 2013; Christian et al., 2018; Marzeion et al., 2018; Zekollari et al., 2020). The size of glaciers during other periods warmer than the Early to Mid-Holocene, such as the MPWP and LIG, is largely unknown because the deposits marking previous extents were in almost all cases over-ridden by later glaciations. For Arctic glaciers, different regional studies consistently indicate that in many places glaciers are now smaller than they have been in millennia (Lowell et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2013, 2017; Harning et al., 2016, 2018; Schweinsberg et al., 2017, 2018; Pendleton et al., 2019)."

Observations between the 1960s and 2019 indicate that mass loss has increased over recent decades (Figure 2.23b).

Observations are in general consistent with trends revealed by global glacier mass change modelling for almost the entire 20th century (1901–1990) implying an estimated mass loss (without uncharted glaciers (Parkes and Marzeion, 2018) and excluding peripheral glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica) of very likely 210 ± 90 Gt yr–1 and very likely 170 ± 80 Gt yr–1 for the period 1971–2019 (Marzeion et al., 2015; Section 9.5.1 and Table 9.5)."

Analysis of speleothem records in Siberian caves, indicates that permafrost was absent in the current continuous permafrost zone at 60°N at the start of the 1.5 Ma record, with aggradation occurring around 0.4 Ma (Vaks et al., 2020). There are indications of extensive permafrost thaw during subsequent interglacials especially further south in the current permafrost zone (Vaks et al., 2013). Reconstruction of permafrost distribution during the LGM indicates that permafrost was more extensive in exposed areas (Vandenberghe et al., 2014). In non-glaciated areas of the North American Arctic there is permafrost that survived the LIG (French and Millar, 2014). Trends and timing of permafrost aggradation and thaw over the last 6 kyr in peatlands of the NH were recently summarized (Hiemstra, 2018; Treat and Jones, 2018). Three multi-century periods (ending 1000 Before the Common Era (BCE), 500 CE and 1850 CE) of permafrost aggradation, associated with neoglaciation periods are inferred resulting in more extensive permafrost in peatlands of the present-day discontinuous permafrost zone, which reached a peak approximately 250 years ago, with thawing occurring concurrently with post 1850 warming (Treat and Jones, 2018). Although permafrost persists in peatlands at the southern extent of the permafrost zone where it was absent prior to 3 ka, there has been thawing since the 1960s (James et al., 2013; B.M.

Recent (2018–2019) permafrost temperatures in the upper 20–30 m layer (at depths where seasonal variation is minimal) were the highest ever directly observed at most sites (Romanovsky et al., 2020), with temperatures in colder permafrost of northern North America being more than 1°C higher than they were in 1978. Increases in temperature of colder Arctic permafrost are larger (average 0.4°C–0.6°C per decade) than for warmer (temperature >–2°C) permafrost (average 0.17°C per decade) of sub-Arctic regions (Figures 2.25, 9.22)."

Over the LDT, ocean warming occurred in two stages, offset by some heat loss during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.58–12.75 ka). Only during a short period of rapid warming at the end of the Younger Dryas (12.75–11.55 ka) were rates comparable to those observed since the 1970s (Bereiter et al., 2018; Shackleton et al., 2019). Ice cores imply a small decrease in the global mean ocean temperature during the early Holocene (<0.4°C) (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019). Sediment cores from the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Ocean (0–1000 m) indicate a stronger regional cooling (compared to mean ocean temperature) of 1.0°C ± 0.7°C to 1.8°C ± 0.4°C from the early/mid-Holocene to ca.1750 CE (Rosenthal et al., 2013, 2017; Morley et al., 2014; Kalansky et al., 2015). Sediment cores from the western equatorial Pacific suggest 0.8°C ± 0.1°C higher temperatures in the upper 700 m of the ocean during 950–1100 CE compared to 1400–1750 CE. These changes are consistent with a global estimate derived from combined surface and subsurface ocean temperature proxy records (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; McGregor et al., 2015). A combined study of model and observational data further confirmed these results, treating temperature as a passive tracer (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019) and addressing the role of circulation dynamics (Scheen and Stocker, 2020). Collectively, the proxy records indicate a global OHC decrease of about 400 ± 70 ZJ (about 170 ± 100 ZJ in the Pacific) in the upper 700 m between 950–1100 CE and 1400–1750 CE, and also suggest that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to this cooling (Rosenthal et al., 2013), partially offsetting the global increase since 1750 CE (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019; Gebbie, 2021)."

Direct estimates benefit from improved: bias adjustments (e.g., Cheng et al., 2018; Leahy et al., 2018; Palmer et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2018; B. Wang et al., 2018; Bagnell and DeVries, 2020; Gouretski and Cheng, 2020); interpolation methods (Kuusela and Stein, 2018; Su et al., 2020); and characterization of sources of uncertainty (e.g., Good, 2017; Wunsch, 2018; Allison et al., 2019; Garry et al., 2019; Meyssignac et al., 2019; Palmer et al., 2021), including those originating from forced and intrinsic ocean variability (Penduff et al., 2018). After 2006 direct OHC estimates for the upper 2000 m layer benefit from the near-global ARGO array with its superior coverage over 60°S–60°N (Roemmich et al., 2019). Indirect estimates include OHC and ThSL series inferred from satellite altimetry and gravimetry since 2003 (Meyssignac et al., 2019), the passive uptake of OHC (ThSL) at centennial timescales inferred from observed SST anomalies, and time-invariant circulation processes from an ocean state estimation (e.g., Zanna et al., 2019). Resplandy et al. (2019) estimate the rate of global OHC uptake over 1991–2016 from changes in atmospheric composition and physical relationships based on CMIP5 model simulations. The uncertainties are broader than from direct estimates but the estimate is qualitatively consistent."

Larger warming rates are observed in the upper 700 m compared to deeper layers, with more areas exhibiting significant warming than significant cooling (Johnson and Lyman, 2020). There is an improved consistency among available estimates of OHC rates in the upper 2000 m since 2006. Cheng et al. (2020), von Schuckmann et al. (2020) and Johnson et al.

Ocean reanalyses support findings of continued upper ocean warming (Balmaseda et al., 2013; von Schuckmann et al., 2018; Meyssignac et al., 2019), albeit with higher spread than solely observational estimates, particularly in the poorly sampled deep ocean below 2000 m (Storto et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2018)."

It is likely  the global ocean has warmed since 1871, consistent with the observed increase in sea surface temperature. It is virtually certain that OHC increased between 1971 and 2018 in the upper 700 m and very likely  in the 700–2000 m layer, with  high confidence since 2006. It is likely  the OHC below 2000 m has increased since 1992.

These episodes were associated with disruptions to the large-scale deep ocean circulation (Buizert et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). Further quantification of paleo salinity changes is complicated by incomplete understanding of proxy-salinity relationships and the relative influence of atmospheric and ocean processes across regions and paleo periods (Rohling, 2007; LeGrande and Schmidt, 2011; Holloway et al., 2016; Conroy et al., 2017)."

Over recent decades, new observations from Argo floats and ocean reanalyses provide general support that changes in the global patterns of near-surface salinity contrast are broadly associated with an intensification of the hydrological cycle (Sections 2.3.1.3.5 and 8.3.1.1). However, this assessment is complicated by changing observational techniques (Section 1.5.1), temporally and spatially inhomogeneous sampling and uncertainties in interpolation algorithms and the substantial influence of modes of natural variabiltity and ocean circulation processes over interannual timescales (Skliris et al., 2014; Durack, 2015; Grist et al., 2016; Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Vinogradova and Ponte, 2017; Liu et al., 2020). Following AR5, based on the updated analysis from Durack and Wijffels (2010) which infills in situ gaps to recover large-scale patterns the mean salinity contrast between high- and low- near-surface salinity regions increased by 0.14 [0.07 to 0.20] from 1950 to 2019."

Correction for past temperatures and a calibration for ice-volume changes implies uncertainty estimates of ± 10–13 m (1 SD) (Grant et al., 2014; Shakun et al., 2015; Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016). A recent marine oxygen-isotope-based GMSL reconstruction (Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016) agrees with previous reconstructions, while focusing on the past 800 kyr (Figure 2.28). It shows that GMSL during the Holocene was among the highest over this entire interval, and was surpassed only during the LIG (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 5e)) and MIS 11 (medium confidence); however, relatively brief (about 2 kyr) highstands during other interglacial periods might be obscured by dating limitations."

This agrees with the elevation of 13 ± 2 m for the MIS 11 subtidal–intertidal transition in South Africa (Roberts et al., 2012). A revised glacial isostatic adjustment at this location resulted in a peak GMSL estimate of 8–11.5 m (Chen et al., 2014). In light of these data, and the review by Dutton et al.

The distribution and thickness of pre-LIG ice sheets (Dendy et al., 2017; Rohling et al., 2017) and isostasy driven by sediment loading since the LIG (Pico, 2020) add further uncertainty. In light of these recent studies and previous assessments, there is medium confidence that peak GMSL during the LIG was likely between 5 and 10 m higher than modern. Relative sea-level estimates from some sites (e.g., Bahamas and Seychelles) report ephemeral, metre-scale fluctuations (Vyverberg et al., 2018). Different generations of LIG reef growth at other sites (e.g., Yucatan Peninsula, Western Australia) suggest the occurrence of sudden accelerations in GMSL change (Blanchon et al., 2009; O’Leary et al., 2013). However, other sites (e.g., South Australia, Mediterranean), indicate that LIG sea level was substantially stable (T.-Y. Pan et al., 2018; Polyak et al., 2018). In addition, there are uncertainties in the interpretation of local relative sea level from some GMSL reconstructions (Barlow et al., 2018).

Estimates from relatively stable locations where the effects of GIA are small and relatively insensitive to parameters defining Earth rheology, and where RSL is expected to approximate GMSL to within about 1 m (e.g., Milne and Mitrovica, 2008), suggest that RSL was between about –6 to +1.5 m at around 6 ka at multiple locations (Camoin et al., 1997; Braithwaite et al., 2000; Frank et al., 2006; Montaggioni and Faure, 2008; Vacchi et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2017; Hibbert et al., 2018).

Over the last about 1.5 kyr, the most prominent century-scale GMSL trends include average maximum rates of lowering and rising of –0.7 ± 0.5 mm yr–1 (2 SD) over 1020–1120 CE, and 0.3 ± 0.5 (2 SD) over 1460–1560, respectively. Between 1000 and 1750 CE, GMSL is estimated to have been within the range of about –0.11 to +0.09 m relative to 1900 (Kemp et al., 2018). This was followed by a sustained increase of GMSL that began between 1820 and 1860 and has continued to the present day. New analyses demonstrate that it is very likely  that GMSL rise over the 20th century was faster than over any preceding century in at least 3 kyr (Kopp et al., 2016; Kemp et al., 2018) (Figure 2.28)."

(2019) combined a Kalman Smoother (Hay et al., 2015) with Reduced Space Optimal Interpolation (Church and White, 2011; Ray and Douglas, 2011) in an effort to better represent both the long-term GMSL change while preserving information on sea-level variability. In addition, new ensemble-based methods for quantifying GMSL change have been presented that account for both structural and parametric uncertainty (Palmer et al., 2021). Altimeter time series of GMSL change (Figure 2.28) have been extended to 2019/2020 but bias adjustments (Watson et al., 2015; Beckley et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017; Ablain et al., 2019; Legeais et al., 2020) did not change since SROCC."

The acceleration rate very likely  is 0.094 [0.082 to 0.115] mm yr–2 for 1993–2018 (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018, updated), consistent with other estimates (Watson et al., 2015; X.

wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"On multi-millennial timescales, proxy evidence indicates that the AMOC varied repeatedly in strength and vertical structure. During the last glacial period, particularly around the LGM, AMOC was estimated to be shallower than present, although there is continued debate about the magnitude of the shoaling (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Gebbie, 2014), and whether this change was associated with a weaker overturning (Ritz et al., 2013; Menviel et al., 2017; Muglia et al., 2018). There are indications that substantial variations in AMOC were associated with abrupt climate changes during the glacial intervals, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events (14–70 ka) (McManus et al., 2004; Böhm et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). During these millennial-scale oscillations, weakened AMOC was associated with dramatic cooling in the NH and warming in the SH (Buizert et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016), while hemispheric changes of opposite sign accompanied strengthened AMOC. After the final demise of the Laurentide ice sheet about 8 ka, the mean overall strength of AMOC has been relatively stable throughout the rest of the Holocene compared to the preceding 100 kyr (Hoffmann et al., 2018; Lippold et al., 2019). There are however indications of episodic variations in AMOC during the Holocene (Bianchi and McCave, 1999; Oppo et al., 2003; Thornalley et al., 2013; Ayache et al., 2018), and past interglacial intervals (Galaasen et al., 2014, 2020; Hayes et al., 2014; Mokeddem et al., 2014; H. Huang et al., 2020). Over the last 3 kyr, there are indications that AMOC variability was potentially linked to decreasing production of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), one of the water masses contributing to AMOC (Alonso-Garcia et al., 2017; Moffa-Sánchez and Hall, 2017; Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Numerous proxy records collectively imply that AMOC is currently at its weakest point in the past 1.6 ka (Rahmstorf et al., 2015; Caesar et al., 2018, 2021; Thibodeau et al., 2018; Thornalley et al., 2018). Caesar et al. (2021) analyse a compilation of various available indirect AMOC proxies from marine sediments, in situ-based reconstructions and terrestrial proxies, which show a decline beginning in the late 19th century and over the 20th century superimposed by large decadal variability in the second half of the 20th century. Indirect reconstructions of AMOC components based on coastal sea level records in the western North Atlantic (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Piecuch, 2020) show an AMOC decline since the late 1950s, with only a short period of recovery during the 1990s."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"However, other studies highlight that proxy records do not show such clear signals (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019), and the use of SST- and coastal sea level-based proxies of AMOC places uncertainties on these results (Little et al., 2019; Jackson and Wood, 2020; Menary et al., 2020). For instance, SSTs are additionally influenced by atmospheric and non-AMOC related ocean variability (Josey et al., 2018; Keil et al., 2020; Menary et al., 2020), while sea level responds to a variety of factors (e.g., atmospheric pressure and local winds) independent of the AMOC (Woodworth et al., 2014; Piecuch and Ponte, 2015; Piecuch et al., 2016). Finally, large decadal variability is present in many reconstructions and obscures estimation of the long-term trend over the 20th century (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Yashayaev and Loder, 2016; Thornalley et al., 2018; Caesar et al., 2021). It is also noted that the proxy reported AMOC decline, beginning in the late 19th century, is not supported by model-based evidence (Sections 3.5.4.1 and 9.2.3.1)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Since the 1980s, multiple lines of observational evidence for AMOC change exist. Ship-based hydrographic estimates of AMOC as far back as the 1980s show no overall decline in AMOC strength (Fu et al., 2020; Worthington et al., 2021). Direct indications from in-situ observations report a –2.5 ± 1.4 Sv change between 1993 and 2010 across the OVIDE section, superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability (Mercier et al., 2015). At 41°N and 26°N, a decline of –3.1 ± 3.2 Sv per decade and –2.5 ± 2.1 Sv per decade respectively has been reported over 2004–2016 (Baringer et al., 2018; Smeed et al., 2018). However, Moat et al. (2020) report an increase in AMOC strength at 26°N over 2009–2018. Recent time series of moored observations at 11ºS (Hummels et al., 2015), 34°S (Meinen et al., 2018; Kersalé et al., 2020), and between 57 and 60ºN (Lozier et al., 2019) are currently too short to permit robust conclusions about changes. The directly observed AMOC weakening since 2004, while significant, is over too short a period to assess whether it is part of a longer term trend or dominated by decadal‐scale internal variability (Smeed et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). Notably an increase and subsequent decline in the 1990s is present in estimates of AMOC and associated heat transport constructed from reanalyses or auxiliary data (Section 9.2.3.1; Frajka-Williams, 2015; Jackson et al., 2016; Trenberth and Fasullo, 2017; Jackson and Wood, 2020)."

An associated strengthening of the outflow from the Labrador Sea has not been observed (Zantopp et al., 2017; Lozier et al., 2019), while strengthening of the AMOC is tentative (Desbruyères et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). A long-term increase of the upper overturning cell in the Southern Ocean since the 1990s can be assessed with low confidence, and there is medium confidence of a decrease in Antarctic bottom water (AABW) volume and circulation, which has potential implications for the strength of the AMOC (Section 9.2.3.2)."

From the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, the directly observed weakening in AMOC (high confidence) cannot be distinguished between decadal-scale variability or a long-term trend (high confidence)."

It was pointed out that these changes are likely predominantly due to interannual-to-decadal variability, and in the case of the subtropical cells represent a reversal of earlier multi-decadal changes. SROCC concluded that it was unlikely  that there has been a statistically significant net southward movement of the mean Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) position over the past 20 years, in contrast to AR5, where this change had been assessed with medium confidence."

The Agulhas current has strengthened substantially during the warming associated with deglaciations of the past 1 Myr (Peeters et al., 2004; Bard and Rickaby, 2009; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010; Marino et al., 2013; Ballalai et al., 2019). According to sediment core analyses, the Agulhas leakage varied by about 10 Sv during major climatic transitions over the past 640 kyr (Caley et al., 2014). Available data suggests that there was relatively little change in the net flow of the ACC during the LGM, with no consensus on the sign of changes (McCave et al., 2013; Lamy et al., 2015; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2016), except at one location at the northern edge of the Drake Passage where a 40% decrease of transport had been reported (Lamy et al., 2015). Longer time series from the northern entrance to Drake Passage suggest a consistent transport variability of 6–16% through glacial climate cycles, with higher current speeds during interglacial times and reduced current speeds during glacial intervals (Toyos et al., 2020). Inferred variability in the size and strength of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre was substantial, and included rapid changes on millennial time scales during both interglacial and glacial intervals over the last 150 kyr (Born and Levermann, 2010; Mokeddem et al., 2014; Irvalı et al., 2016; Mokeddem and McManus, 2016). North Atlantic – Arctic exchange has also varied in the past, with indications of an increasing inflow of Atlantic waters into the Arctic during the late Holocene (Ślubowska et al., 2005) with an acceleration to the recent inflow that is now the largest of the past 2 kyr (Spielhagen et al., 2011)."

However, they do not support an intensification of WBCs, with a weakening, broadening, or little change reported for the Kuroshio (Y.-L.

The Gulf Stream has recently reversed a long-term poleward migration (Bisagni et al., 2017). Multidecadal variability of the strength and position of WBCs (Hsin, 2015; Bisagni et al., 2017; McCarthy et al., 2018) and short records from direct observations obscure the detection of any long-term trends (Yang et al., 2020)."

However, only during the PETM is the change sufficiently well-constrained to allow for a direct comparison with recent and current trends (Kirtland Turner, 2018). This event was associated with profound perturbations of the global carbon cycle, ocean warming, deoxygenation and a surface ocean pH decrease likely ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Penman et al., 2014; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018) – a rate that was likely at least an order of magnitude slower than today (Cui et al., 2011; Bowen et al., 2015; Frieling et al., 2016; Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner, 2018; Gingerich, 2019)."

Paleo records point to past periods of reduced oceanic oxygen levels during the late Permian (about 250 Ma), the Jurassic and the Cretaceous (180–100 Ma), alongside associated global scale disturbances of the global carbon cycle. Emerging studies for the Cenozoic Era suggest more stable ocean oxygenation conditions throughout the interval on million-year time scales (X. Wang et al., 2016). Sedimentary proxy data indicate, however, that the seemingly stable Cenozoic was punctuated by transient, widespread deoxygenation during the PETM (Dickson et al., 2012; Winguth et al., 2012; Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean reaching anoxic levels (Section 5.3.1.1; Yao et al., 2018). Since the LGM, there was an overall emergence and expansion of low-oxygen waters into the ocean intermediate depths as a result of rapid warming and a reorganization of the global overturning circulation (Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015). The maximum expansion of oxygen-depleted waters during the LDT occurred coincidently with rapid warming in the NH at 14.7–12.9 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Moffitt et al., 2015; Hoogakker et al., 2018). Deep (>1500 m) ocean oxygen levels increased by 100–150 µmol kg–1 since the LGM, reaching modern oxygen levels at about 10 ka (Section 5.3.1.2; Hoogakker et al., 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019)."

In some locations, however, the magnitude of oxygen loss substantially exceeds global averages (Queste et al., 2018; Bronselaer et al., 2020; Cummins and Ross, 2020; Stramma et al., 2020). For example, a decline in oxygen content of 11.7 ± 3.5% in the upper 4000 m, including a decline of 20.4 ± 7.2% in the upper 1550 m, is reported in the North Pacific over the period 1958–2018 (Cummins and Ross, 2020) (equivalent to 2.3 μmol kg−1 per decade in the upper 1550 m and 2.0 μmol kg−1 decade− 1 throughout the 4000 m water column).

Over the LDT, ocean warming occurred in two stages, offset by some heat loss during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.58–12.75 ka). Only during a short period of rapid warming at the end of the Younger Dryas (12.75–11.55 ka) were rates comparable to those observed since the 1970s (Bereiter et al., 2018; Shackleton et al., 2019). Ice cores imply a small decrease in the global mean ocean temperature during the early Holocene (<0.4°C) (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019). Sediment cores from the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Ocean (0–1000 m) indicate a stronger regional cooling (compared to mean ocean temperature) of 1.0°C ± 0.7°C to 1.8°C ± 0.4°C from the early/mid-Holocene to ca.1750 CE (Rosenthal et al., 2013, 2017; Morley et al., 2014; Kalansky et al., 2015). Sediment cores from the western equatorial Pacific suggest 0.8°C ± 0.1°C higher temperatures in the upper 700 m of the ocean during 950–1100 CE compared to 1400–1750 CE. These changes are consistent with a global estimate derived from combined surface and subsurface ocean temperature proxy records (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; McGregor et al., 2015). A combined study of model and observational data further confirmed these results, treating temperature as a passive tracer (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019) and addressing the role of circulation dynamics (Scheen and Stocker, 2020). Collectively, the proxy records indicate a global OHC decrease of about 400 ± 70 ZJ (about 170 ± 100 ZJ in the Pacific) in the upper 700 m between 950–1100 CE and 1400–1750 CE, and also suggest that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to this cooling (Rosenthal et al., 2013), partially offsetting the global increase since 1750 CE (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019; Gebbie, 2021)."

Direct estimates benefit from improved: bias adjustments (e.g., Cheng et al., 2018; Leahy et al., 2018; Palmer et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2018; B.

After 2006 direct OHC estimates for the upper 2000 m layer benefit from the near-global ARGO array with its superior coverage over 60°S–60°N (Roemmich et al., 2019). Indirect estimates include OHC and ThSL series inferred from satellite altimetry and gravimetry since 2003 (Meyssignac et al., 2019), the passive uptake of OHC (ThSL) at centennial timescales inferred from observed SST anomalies, and time-invariant circulation processes from an ocean state estimation (e.g., Zanna et al., 2019). Resplandy et al. (2019) estimate the rate of global OHC uptake over 1991–2016 from changes in atmospheric composition and physical relationships based on CMIP5 model simulations. The uncertainties are broader than from direct estimates but the estimate is qualitatively consistent."

There is an improved consistency among available estimates of OHC rates in the upper 2000 m since 2006. Cheng et al. (2020), von Schuckmann et al. (2020) and Johnson et al.

Ocean reanalyses support findings of continued upper ocean warming (Balmaseda et al., 2013; von Schuckmann et al., 2018; Meyssignac et al., 2019), albeit with higher spread than solely observational estimates, particularly in the poorly sampled deep ocean below 2000 m (Storto et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2018)."

It is likely  the global ocean has warmed since 1871, consistent with the observed increase in sea surface temperature. It is virtually certain that OHC increased between 1971 and 2018 in the upper 700 m and very likely  in the 700–2000 m layer, with  high confidence since 2006. It is likely  the OHC below 2000 m has increased since 1992.

These episodes were associated with disruptions to the large-scale deep ocean circulation (Buizert et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). Further quantification of paleo salinity changes is complicated by incomplete understanding of proxy-salinity relationships and the relative influence of atmospheric and ocean processes across regions and paleo periods (Rohling, 2007; LeGrande and Schmidt, 2011; Holloway et al., 2016; Conroy et al., 2017)."

Over recent decades, new observations from Argo floats and ocean reanalyses provide general support that changes in the global patterns of near-surface salinity contrast are broadly associated with an intensification of the hydrological cycle (Sections 2.3.1.3.5 and 8.3.1.1). However, this assessment is complicated by changing observational techniques (Section 1.5.1), temporally and spatially inhomogeneous sampling and uncertainties in interpolation algorithms and the substantial influence of modes of natural variabiltity and ocean circulation processes over interannual timescales (Skliris et al., 2014; Durack, 2015; Grist et al., 2016; Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Vinogradova and Ponte, 2017; Liu et al., 2020). Following AR5, based on the updated analysis from Durack and Wijffels (2010) which infills in situ gaps to recover large-scale patterns the mean salinity contrast between high- and low- near-surface salinity regions increased by 0.14 [0.07 to 0.20] from 1950 to 2019."

A recent marine oxygen-isotope-based GMSL reconstruction (Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016) agrees with previous reconstructions, while focusing on the past 800 kyr (Figure 2.28). It shows that GMSL during the Holocene was among the highest over this entire interval, and was surpassed only during the LIG (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 5e)) and MIS 11 (medium confidence); however, relatively brief (about 2 kyr) highstands during other interglacial periods might be obscured by dating limitations."

This agrees with the elevation of 13 ± 2 m for the MIS 11 subtidal–intertidal transition in South Africa (Roberts et al., 2012).

The distribution and thickness of pre-LIG ice sheets (Dendy et al., 2017; Rohling et al., 2017) and isostasy driven by sediment loading since the LIG (Pico, 2020) add further uncertainty. In light of these recent studies and previous assessments, there is medium confidence that peak GMSL during the LIG was likely between 5 and 10 m higher than modern. Relative sea-level estimates from some sites (e.g., Bahamas and Seychelles) report ephemeral, metre-scale fluctuations (Vyverberg et al., 2018). Different generations of LIG reef growth at other sites (e.g., Yucatan Peninsula, Western Australia) suggest the occurrence of sudden accelerations in GMSL change (Blanchon et al., 2009; O’Leary et al., 2013). However, other sites (e.g., South Australia, Mediterranean), indicate that LIG sea level was substantially stable (T.-Y. Pan et al., 2018; Polyak et al., 2018).

The average rate for 1901–2018 was 1.73 [1.28 to 2.17] mm yr–1 with a total rise of 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m (Table 9.5). The acceleration rate very likely  is 0.094 [0.082 to 0.115] mm yr–2 for 1993–2018 (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018, updated), consistent with other estimates (Watson et al., 2015; X. Chen et al., 2017; Nerem et al., 2018; WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; Ablain et al., 2019; Legeais et al., 2020). For the period 1902–2010 the updated tide gauge reconstructions published since SROCC also show a robust acceleration over the 20th century and the ensemble estimate of Palmer et al. (2021) gives a value of 0.0053 [0.0042 to 0.0073] mm yr–2, based on an unweighted quadratic fit."

Further back in time, there is medium confidence that GMSL was within –3.5 to +0.5 m (very likely range) of present during the MH, 5–10 m higher (likely range) during the LIG, and 5–25 m higher (very likely range) during the MPWP."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 concluded that there was no evidence of a trend in the AMOC during the period of instrumental observations. However, AR5 also stressed insufficient evidence to support a finding of change in the heat transport of the AMOC. SROCC assessed that there was emerging evidence in sustained observations, both in situ (2004–2017) and revealed from SST-based reconstructions, that the AMOC had weakened during the instrumental era relative to 1850–1900 (medium confidence), although there were insufficient data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening. SROCC also concluded with low confidence an increase of the Southern Ocean upper cell overturning circulation. SROCC also reported with medium confidence that the production of Antarctic Bottom Water had decreased since the 1950s consistent with a decreased lower cell overturning circulation, and potentially modulating the strength of the AMOC."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"On multi-millennial timescales, proxy evidence indicates that the AMOC varied repeatedly in strength and vertical structure. During the last glacial period, particularly around the LGM, AMOC was estimated to be shallower than present, although there is continued debate about the magnitude of the shoaling (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Gebbie, 2014), and whether this change was associated with a weaker overturning (Ritz et al., 2013; Menviel et al., 2017; Muglia et al., 2018). There are indications that substantial variations in AMOC were associated with abrupt climate changes during the glacial intervals, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events (14–70 ka) (McManus et al., 2004; Böhm et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). During these millennial-scale oscillations, weakened AMOC was associated with dramatic cooling in the NH and warming in the SH (Buizert et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016), while hemispheric changes of opposite sign accompanied strengthened AMOC. After the final demise of the Laurentide ice sheet about 8 ka, the mean overall strength of AMOC has been relatively stable throughout the rest of the Holocene compared to the preceding 100 kyr (Hoffmann et al., 2018; Lippold et al., 2019). There are however indications of episodic variations in AMOC during the Holocene (Bianchi and McCave, 1999; Oppo et al., 2003; Thornalley et al., 2013; Ayache et al., 2018), and past interglacial intervals (Galaasen et al., 2014, 2020; Hayes et al., 2014; Mokeddem et al., 2014; H. Huang et al., 2020). Over the last 3 kyr, there are indications that AMOC variability was potentially linked to decreasing production of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), one of the water masses contributing to AMOC (Alonso-Garcia et al., 2017; Moffa-Sánchez and Hall, 2017; Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Numerous proxy records collectively imply that AMOC is currently at its weakest point in the past 1.6 ka (Rahmstorf et al., 2015; Caesar et al., 2018, 2021; Thibodeau et al., 2018; Thornalley et al., 2018). Caesar et al. (2021) analyse a compilation of various available indirect AMOC proxies from marine sediments, in situ-based reconstructions and terrestrial proxies, which show a decline beginning in the late 19th century and over the 20th century superimposed by large decadal variability in the second half of the 20th century. Indirect reconstructions of AMOC components based on coastal sea level records in the western North Atlantic (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Piecuch, 2020) show an AMOC decline since the late 1950s, with only a short period of recovery during the 1990s."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"However, other studies highlight that proxy records do not show such clear signals (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019), and the use of SST- and coastal sea level-based proxies of AMOC places uncertainties on these results (Little et al., 2019; Jackson and Wood, 2020; Menary et al., 2020). For instance, SSTs are additionally influenced by atmospheric and non-AMOC related ocean variability (Josey et al., 2018; Keil et al., 2020; Menary et al., 2020), while sea level responds to a variety of factors (e.g., atmospheric pressure and local winds) independent of the AMOC (Woodworth et al., 2014; Piecuch and Ponte, 2015; Piecuch et al., 2016). Finally, large decadal variability is present in many reconstructions and obscures estimation of the long-term trend over the 20th century (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Yashayaev and Loder, 2016; Thornalley et al., 2018; Caesar et al., 2021). It is also noted that the proxy reported AMOC decline, beginning in the late 19th century, is not supported by model-based evidence (Sections 3.5.4.1 and 9.2.3.1)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Since the 1980s, multiple lines of observational evidence for AMOC change exist. Ship-based hydrographic estimates of AMOC as far back as the 1980s show no overall decline in AMOC strength (Fu et al., 2020; Worthington et al., 2021). Direct indications from in-situ observations report a –2.5 ± 1.4 Sv change between 1993 and 2010 across the OVIDE section, superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability (Mercier et al., 2015). At 41°N and 26°N, a decline of –3.1 ± 3.2 Sv per decade and –2.5 ± 2.1 Sv per decade respectively has been reported over 2004–2016 (Baringer et al., 2018; Smeed et al., 2018). However, Moat et al. (2020) report an increase in AMOC strength at 26°N over 2009–2018. Recent time series of moored observations at 11ºS (Hummels et al., 2015), 34°S (Meinen et al., 2018; Kersalé et al., 2020), and between 57 and 60ºN (Lozier et al., 2019) are currently too short to permit robust conclusions about changes. The directly observed AMOC weakening since 2004, while significant, is over too short a period to assess whether it is part of a longer term trend or dominated by decadal‐scale internal variability (Smeed et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). Notably an increase and subsequent decline in the 1990s is present in estimates of AMOC and associated heat transport constructed from reanalyses or auxiliary data (Section 9.2.3.1; Frajka-Williams, 2015; Jackson et al., 2016; Trenberth and Fasullo, 2017; Jackson and Wood, 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Repeated full depth in situ measurements report that deep convection – a major driver for AMOC – has recently returned to the Labrador Sea, particularly in 2015 (Yashayaev and Loder, 2016; Rhein et al., 2017), and to the Irminger Sea (de Jong and de Steur, 2016; Gladyshev et al., 2016; de Jong et al., 2018) following an extended period with weak convection since 2000. An associated strengthening of the outflow from the Labrador Sea has not been observed (Zantopp et al., 2017; Lozier et al., 2019), while strengthening of the AMOC is tentative (Desbruyères et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). A long-term increase of the upper overturning cell in the Southern Ocean since the 1990s can be assessed with low confidence, and there is medium confidence of a decrease in Antarctic bottom water (AABW) volume and circulation, which has potential implications for the strength of the AMOC (Section 9.2.3.2)."

From the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, the directly observed weakening in AMOC (high confidence) cannot be distinguished between decadal-scale variability or a long-term trend (high confidence)."

The AR5 reported with medium to  high confidence intensification of the North Pacific subpolar gyre, the South Pacific subtropical gyre, and the subtropical cells, along with an expansion of the North Pacific subtropical gyre since the 1990s. It was pointed out that these changes are likely predominantly due to interannual-to-decadal variability, and in the case of the subtropical cells represent a reversal of earlier multi-decadal changes. SROCC concluded that it was unlikely  that there has been a statistically significant net southward movement of the mean Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) position over the past 20 years, in contrast to AR5, where this change had been assessed with medium confidence."
wg1_ch02_2.3.3.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The intensity of the Kuroshio current system in the north-west Pacific varied in conjunction with the glaciation cycles over the last 1 Myr, with some limited glacial-interglacial variability in position (Jian et al., 2000; Gallagher et al., 2015). The Agulhas current has strengthened substantially during the warming associated with deglaciations of the past 1 Myr (Peeters et al., 2004; Bard and Rickaby, 2009; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010; Marino et al., 2013; Ballalai et al., 2019). According to sediment core analyses, the Agulhas leakage varied by about 10 Sv during major climatic transitions over the past 640 kyr (Caley et al., 2014). Available data suggests that there was relatively little change in the net flow of the ACC during the LGM, with no consensus on the sign of changes (McCave et al., 2013; Lamy et al., 2015; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2016), except at one location at the northern edge of the Drake Passage where a 40% decrease of transport had been reported (Lamy et al., 2015). Longer time series from the northern entrance to Drake Passage suggest a consistent transport variability of 6–16% through glacial climate cycles, with higher current speeds during interglacial times and reduced current speeds during glacial intervals (Toyos et al., 2020). Inferred variability in the size and strength of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre was substantial, and included rapid changes on millennial time scales during both interglacial and glacial intervals over the last 150 kyr (Born and Levermann, 2010; Mokeddem et al., 2014; Irvalı et al., 2016; Mokeddem and McManus, 2016). North Atlantic – Arctic exchange has also varied in the past, with indications of an increasing inflow of Atlantic waters into the Arctic during the late Holocene (Ślubowska et al., 2005) with an acceleration to the recent inflow that is now the largest of the past 2 kyr (Spielhagen et al., 2011)."

Direct observations show a systematic poleward migration of WBCs (Wu et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016, 2020; Bisagni et al., 2017). However, they do not support an intensification of WBCs, with a weakening, broadening, or little change reported for the Kuroshio (Y.-L.

The Gulf Stream has recently reversed a long-term poleward migration (Bisagni et al., 2017). Multidecadal variability of the strength and position of WBCs (Hsin, 2015; Bisagni et al., 2017; McCarthy et al., 2018) and short records from direct observations obscure the detection of any long-term trends (Yang et al., 2020)."

Over the last 65 million years there have been several intervals when the pH of surface waters varied concurrently with climate change such as during the PETM, EECO, and MCO (Figure 2.29a and Section 5.3.1.1). However, only during the PETM is the change sufficiently well-constrained to allow for a direct comparison with recent and current trends (Kirtland Turner, 2018). This event was associated with profound perturbations of the global carbon cycle, ocean warming, deoxygenation and a surface ocean pH decrease likely ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Penman et al., 2014; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018) – a rate that was likely at least an order of magnitude slower than today (Cui et al., 2011; Bowen et al., 2015; Frieling et al., 2016; Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner, 2018; Gingerich, 2019)."

Paleo records point to past periods of reduced oceanic oxygen levels during the late Permian (about 250 Ma), the Jurassic and the Cretaceous (180–100 Ma), alongside associated global scale disturbances of the global carbon cycle. Emerging studies for the Cenozoic Era suggest more stable ocean oxygenation conditions throughout the interval on million-year time scales (X. Wang et al., 2016). Sedimentary proxy data indicate, however, that the seemingly stable Cenozoic was punctuated by transient, widespread deoxygenation during the PETM (Dickson et al., 2012; Winguth et al., 2012; Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean reaching anoxic levels (Section 5.3.1.1; Yao et al., 2018). Since the LGM, there was an overall emergence and expansion of low-oxygen waters into the ocean intermediate depths as a result of rapid warming and a reorganization of the global overturning circulation (Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015). The maximum expansion of oxygen-depleted waters during the LDT occurred coincidently with rapid warming in the NH at 14.7–12.9 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Moffitt et al., 2015; Hoogakker et al., 2018).

wg1_ch02_2.3.3.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"Subsurface (100–400 m) oxygen in the California Current system is estimated to have declined by 24 ± 2 μmol kg−1 (1.0 μmol kg−1 per decade) between 1993 and 2018, a rate similar to the global upper 1000 m average (Bindoff et al., 2019). In some locations, however, the magnitude of oxygen loss substantially exceeds global averages (Queste et al., 2018; Bronselaer et al., 2020; Cummins and Ross, 2020; Stramma et al., 2020). For example, a decline in oxygen content of 11.7 ± 3.5% in the upper 4000 m, including a decline of 20.4 ± 7.2% in the upper 1550 m, is reported in the North Pacific over the period 1958–2018 (Cummins and Ross, 2020) (equivalent to 2.3 μmol kg−1 per decade in the upper 1550 m and 2.0 μmol kg−1 decade− 1 throughout the 4000 m water column). In some regions of the Southern Ocean south of 65°S oxygen in the upper 2000 m has declined by 60 μmol kg−1 (~52 μmol kg−1 per decade) based on comparisons of 2014–2019 and 1985–2005 observations (Bronselaer et al., 2020). Within some OMZs regions of the Indian ocean, oxygen has declined from 6–12 to <2 μmol kg−1 between the 1960s and 2015–2016 (Bristow et al., 2017; Al-Said et al., 2018; Queste et al., 2018)."

The largest expansions of oxygen depleted waters over the past 25 ka were strongly linked to rapid warming rates (medium confidence). Open-ocean deoxygenation has occurred in most regions of the open ocean during the mid-20th to early 21st centuries (high confidence), and shows decadal variability (medium confidence).

In selecting the indicators, we focussed on (i) those that are observable at large (global) spatial scales and over long (two decades or more) temporal scales, using standardized and consistent procedures; and (ii) those that are illustrative of the influence of the physical system on the biological realm. Chapters 2 and 3 of AR6 WGII undertake a more holistic assessment of biospheric impacts."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 noted that because CO2 uptake by photosynthesis occurs only during the growing season, the greater land mass in the NH imparts a characteristic ‘sawtooth’ seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO2. The SRCCL similarly stated that due to strong seasonal patterns of growth, NH terrestrial ecosystems are largely responsible for the seasonal variations in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Neither AR5 nor SRCCL made a confidence statement about observed changes in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of CO2."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"In situ observations of CO2 generally depict a rising amplitude of the seasonal cycle over the past half century, especially north of about 45°N (Figure 2.30). For example, an amplitude increase of 6 ± 2.6% per decade has been observed at the Barrow surface observatory in Alaska over 1961–2011 (Graven et al., 2013), with slightly slower increases thereafter. Aircraft data north of 45°N exhibit an amplitude increase of 57 ± 7% at 500 mb versus an increase of 26 ± 18% for 35°N–45°N between field campaigns in 1958–1961 and 2009–2011 (Graven et al., 2013). Increases in amplitude for the period 1980–2012 are apparent at eight surface observatories north of 50°N (Piao et al., 2018), related primarily to a larger drawdown in June and July. Trends in seasonal cycle amplitude at lower latitudes are smaller (if present at all); for instance, the increase at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since the early 1960s is only about half as large as at Barrow (Graven et al., 2013), and only one other low-latitude observatory has a significant increase from 1980–2012 (Piao et al., 2018). There is a weak signal of an increase in amplitude at the Sinhagad observatory in western India in recent years (Chakraborty et al., 2020). Generally speaking, larger increases in the Arctic and boreal regions are indicative of changes in vegetation and carbon cycle dynamics in northern ecosystems (Forkel et al., 2016), though increased carbon uptake can also result from other factors such as warmer- and wetter-than-normal conditions."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recent satellite-based, global-scale estimates of seasonal variations in atmospheric CO2 for the period 2003–2018 show that the seasonal variations in the SH are out of phase with those in the NH (Reuter et al., 2020), which is consistent with the phenological shifts in primary productivity between hemispheres. The net effect of the phase shift between the two hemispheres is to dampen the amplitude of the global average seasonal cycle. These integrated results also show that the amplitude of the oscillations has been increasing in the SH, from about 2009, but comparison with data from Baring head suggests that periods of high seasonal oscillation had occurred at that location in the SH prior to 1995."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is very  high confidence that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 has increased at mid-to-high NH latitudes since the early 1960s. The observed increase is generally consistent with greater greening during the growing season and an increase in the length of the growing season over the high northern latitudes. Similarly, globally-integrated results from the SH also show an increase in seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 signal, from around 2009 to 2018 (low confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"SROCC pointed out that long-term global observations of many key ocean variables, including phytoplankton, have not reached the density and accuracy necessary for detecting change. But SROCC noted the good comparability between short time-scale single-sensor ocean-colour products and a longer time-scale, climate-quality time series of multi-sensor, inter-sensor-bias-corrected, and error-characterized, global data on chlorophyll-a concentration in the surface layers of the ocean. With respect to oligotrophic gyres, AR5 WGII concluded that the oligotrophic subtropical gyres of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are expanding and that they indicate declining phytoplankton stocks in these waters (limited evidence, low agreement). With respect to distributions of marine organisms, AR5 WGII reported range shifts of benthic, pelagic, and demersal species and communities (high confidence), though the shifts were not uniform."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Phytoplankton are responsible for marine primary production through photosynthesis; they are a major player in the ocean carbon cycle. They have a high metabolic rate and respond fast to changes in environmental conditions (light, temperature, nutrients, mixing), and as such, serve as a key indicator for change in marine ecosystems. Concentration of chlorophyll-a, the major photosynthetic pigment in all phytoplankton, is often used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass. As primary producers, they are also food for organisms at higher trophic levels. The multi-sensor time series of chlorophyll-a concentration has now been updated (Sathyendranath et al., 2019) to cover 1998–2018. Figure 2.31 shows that global trends in chlorophyll-a for the last two decades are insignificant over large areas of the global ocean (von Schuckmann et al., 2019), but some regions exhibit significant trends, with positive trends in parts of the Arctic and the Antarctic waters (>3% yr–1), and both negative and positive trends (within ± 3% yr–1) in parts of the tropics, subtropics and temperate waters. The interannual variability in chlorophyll-a data in many regions is strongly tied to indices of climate variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV) and changes in total concentration are typically associated with changes in phytoplankton community structure (e.g., Brewin et al., 2012; Racault et al., 2017b). Variability in community structure related to El Niño has, in turn, been linked to variability in fisheries, for example in the catch of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) in the Humboldt current ecosystem (Jackson et al., 2011)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 WGII, analysis of a longer time series of ocean-colour data (1998–2012) has shown (Aiken et al., 2017) that the expansion of the low nutrient part of the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre was significant, at 0.27 × 106km2 per decade, but that the rate was much lower than that reported earlier by Polovina et al. (2008). Furthermore, Aiken et al. (2017) reported no significant trend in the oligotrophic area of the South Atlantic Gyre. With the time series extended to 2016, von Schuckmann et al. (2018) reported that since 2007, there was a general decreasing trend in the areas of the North and South Pacific oligotrophic Gyres, while the North and South Atlantic oligotrophic Gyres remained stable, with little change in area, consistent with Aiken et al .  (2017). The changing sign of trends in the areal extent of the oligotrophic gyres with increase in the length of the time series raises the possibility that these changes arise from interannual to multi-decadal variability. The time series of ocean-colour data is too short to discern any trend that might be superimposed on such variability."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Similarly, there is limited consistent and long-term information on large-scale distributions of marine organisms at higher trophic levels. But there are increased indications since AR5 and SROCC that the distributions of various higher trophic-level organisms are shifting both polewards and to deeper levels (Edwards et al., 2016; Haug et al., 2017; Atkinson et al., 2019; Lenoir et al., 2020; Pinsky et al., 2020), mostly consistent with changes in temperature. However observations also show a smaller set of counter-intuitive migrations towards warmer and shallower waters, which could be related to changes in phenology and in larval transport by currents (Fuchs et al., 2020). There are also strengthening indications of greater representation by species with warm-water affinity in marine communities, consistent with expectations under observed warming (Burrows et al., 2019). There are indications that pre-1850 CE plankton communities are different from their modern counterparts globally (Jonkers et al., 2019). Indicators of geographical distributions of species (mostly from coastal waters) suggest that the rates at which some species are leaving or arriving at an ecosystem are variable, leading to changes in community composition (Blowes et al., 2019), with likely greater representation of warm-water species in some locations (Burrows et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is  high confidence that the latitudinal and depth limits of the distribution of various organisms in the marine biome are changing. There is medium confidence that there are differences in the responses of individual species relative to each other, such that the species compositions of ecosystems are changing. There is medium confidence that chlorophyll concentration in the surface shows weak negative and positive trends in parts of low and mid latitudes, and weak positive trends in some high-latitude areas. There is medium confidence that the large-scale distribution of the oligotrophic gyre provinces is subject to significant inter-annual variations, but low confidence in the long-term trends in the areal extent of these provinces because of insufficient length of direct observations."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"SROCC expressed low confidence in satellite-based estimates of trends in marine primary production, citing insufficient length of the time series and lack of corroborating in situ measurements and independent validation time series. The report also cites significant mismatches in absolute values and decadal trends in primary production when different satellite-based products are compared."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Recent model-based results with assimilation of satellite data (Gregg and Rousseaux, 2019), show global annual mean marine primary production of around 38 (±1.13) PgC yr–1 over 1998–2015. This new result lies towards the low end of values reported in earlier, satellite-based, studies (range 36.5–67 PgC yr–1, reported in Sathyendranath et al. (2020)). Reconciling the results of Gregg and Rousseaux (2019) with earlier satellite-based studies leads to a mean of 47 (±7.8) PgC yr–1. There is a strong correlation between interannual regional variability in marine primary production and climate variability (Racault et al., 2017b; Gregg and Rousseaux, 2019). The increase in primary production in the Arctic has been associated with retreating sea ice and with increases in nutrient supply and chlorophyll concentration (Lewis et al., 2020). Gregg and Rousseaux (2019) reported a decreasing trend in marine primary production, of –0.8 PgC (–2.1%) per decade globally. There is low confidence in this trend because of the small number of studies and the short length of the time series (<20 years)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In conclusion, there is low confidence because of the small number of recent studies and the insufficient length of the time series analysed that marine primary production is 47 (± 7.8) PgC yr–1. A small decrease in productivity is evident globally for the period 1998–2015, but regional changes are larger and of opposing signs (low confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Phenology is the study of the timing of important events in the annual life cycle of organisms (plants or animals; see also Annex VII: Glossary). The AR5 WGII noted that the timing of various seasonal biological events in the ocean had advanced by more than four days per decade over the previous 50-year period and concluded that there was  high confidence in observed changes in the phenological metrics of marine organisms. The AR5 WGII further reported that, of those observations that showed a response, 81% of changes in phenology, distribution and abundance were consistent with anticipated responses to climate warming according to theoretical expectations, corroborated by updates in SROCC. The consequent current and future impacts on interactions between species, including competition and predator-prey dynamics, were noted with  high confidence."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are additional indications that phenological metrics related to different species are changing, but not always in a similar manner. For example, many seabirds are breeding earlier, while others are breeding later (Sydeman et al., 2015). Planktonic organisms in the North Atlantic are also responding differently to each other when subjected to the same environmental changes (Edwards and Richardson, 2004). Furthermore, different factors could be responsible for triggering phenological responses in different stages in the life cycle of a single organism (Koeller et al., 2009). The shift in the distribution of many benthic invertebrates on the North-west Atlantic shelf, including some commercially important shellfish, could be explained by phenology and larval transport, and the shift and contraction of species range have been associated with higher mortality (Fuchs et al., 2020). Changes in phytoplankton phenological indicators globally (Racault et al., 2012; Sapiano et al., 2012) have been linked to indicators of climate variability, such as the multivariate ENSO Index (Racault et al., 2017a), with responses varying across ecological provinces of the ocean (Longhurst, 2007)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Phenological links between multiple components of an ecosystem have to be maintained intact, to retain system integrity. Since all higher pelagic organisms depend on phytoplankton for their food, either directly or indirectly, a match favours survival, and a mismatch is antagonistic to survival. Match represents synchronicity in the phenological events of both prey and predator. There are indications from ocean-colour data used in conjunction with fisheries data that the survival rate of various larger marine organisms depends on phenological metrics related to the seasonality of phytoplankton growth. Such links have been demonstrated, for example, for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in the North-west Atlantic (Platt et al., 2003); northern shrimp in the North Atlantic (Koeller et al., 2009; Ouellet et al., 2011); sardine (Sardinella aurita) off the Ivory coast (Kassi et al., 2018); cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae in the North-West Atlantic (Trzcinski et al., 2013); and oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps) off the south-west coast of India. Borstad et al. (2011) showed that fledgling production rate of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) on a remote island in coastal north-eastern Pacific was related to seasonal values of chlorophyll-a biomass in the vicinity of the island."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"In summary, new in situ data as well as satellite observations strengthen AR5 and SROCC findings that various phenological metrics for many species of marine organisms have changed in the last half century (high confidence), though many regions and many species of marine organisms remain under-sampled or even unsampled. The changes vary with location and with species (high confidence). There is a strong dependence of survival in higher trophic-level organisms (fish, exploited invertebrates, birds) on the availability of food at various stages in their life cycle, which in turn depends on phenologies of both (high confidence). There is a gap in our understanding of how the varied responses of marine organisms to climate change, from a phenological perspective, might threaten the stability and integrity of entire ecosystems."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 WGII briefly discussed large-scale changes in the length of the growing season but made no confidence statement about observed trends. However, AR5 did conclude with  high confidence that warming contributed to an overall spring advancement in the NH."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Recent in situ analyses document increases in the length of the thermal growing season (i.e., the period of the year when temperatures are warm enough to support growth) over much of the extratropical land surface since at least the mid-20th century. Over the NH as a whole, an increase of about 2.0 days per decade is evident for 1951–2018 (Dunn et al., 2020), with slightly larger increases north of 45°N (Barichivich et al., 2013). Over North America, a rise of about 1.3 days per decade is apparent in the United States for 1900–2014 (Kukal and Irmak, 2018), with larger increases after 1980 (McCabe et al., 2015); likewise, all ecozones in Canada experienced increases from 1950–2010 (Pedlar et al., 2015). Growing season length in China increased by at least 1.0 days per decade since 1960 (Xia et al., 2018) and by several days per decade in South Korea since 1970 (Jung et al., 2015). In general, changes in phenological indicators are consistent with the increase in growing season length documented by instrumental data (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015). Several long-term, site-specific records illustrate the unusualness of recent phenological changes relative to interannual variability; for example, peak bloom dates for cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan have occurred progressively earlier in the growing season in recent decades, as have grape harvest dates in Beaune, France (Figure 2.32)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Changes in the length of the photosynthetically active growing season (derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) are also evident over many land areas since the early 1980s. Increases of about 2.0 days per decade are apparent north of 45°N since the early 1980s (centred over mid-latitude Eurasia and north-eastern North America), with indications of a reversal to a decline in season length starting in the early 2000s (Barichivich et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015; Garonna et al., 2016; Q. Liu et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016). Satellite-based records suggest that most NH regions have experienced both an earlier start and a later end to the growing season, a finding supported by ground-based data (Piao et al., 2020). A number of studies also capture increases in growing season length over the Canadian Arctic (W. Chen et al., 2016), Fennoscandia (Høgda et al., 2013), most of Europe (Garonna et al., 2014), and parts of sub-Saharan Africa (Vrieling et al., 2013)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The general consistency between in situ and satellite estimates over the NH is noteworthy given that many factors independently contribute to uncertainty in observed changes. For example, there is no universally accepted definition of growing season length across in situ analyses; some define the growing season as the period based on a temperature threshold (e.g., 5°C) whereas others use the frost-free period. Spatial and temporal coverage can also affect conclusions based upon in situ studies (Donat et al., 2013b). For satellite analyses, uncertainties can be related to the satellite datasets themselves (e.g., satellite drift, sensor differences, calibration uncertainties, atmospheric effects); and to the methods for determining phenological metrics (e.g., start, end, and length of season; S. Wang et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, based on multiple independent analyses of in situ, satellite, and phenological data, there is  high confidence that the length of the growing season has increased over much of the extratropical NH since at least the mid-20th century."

wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Paleoclimate reconstructions document large-scale biome shifts from the deep past through the Holocene (e.g., Hoogakker et al., 2016). The northernmost location of the treeline is a representative indicator in this regard (Figure 2.34). During the MPWP, boreal forest extended to the Arctic coast, with the northernmost treeline being about 4° to 10° latitude further north than at present; temperate forests and grasslands were also shifted poleward (with reduced tundra extent), while savannahs and woodlands were more expansive in Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1b; Salzmann et al., 2008, 2013; Sniderman et al., 2016; Andrae et al., 2018). During the LGM, tundra and steppe expanded whereas forests were globally reduced in extent (Prentice et al., 2000; Binney et al., 2017), the northern treeline being about 17° to 23° latitude south of its present-day location in most areas. During the LDT, pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and other climatic changes (Nolan et al., 2018; Fordham et al., 2020). By the MH, North Africa had experienced a widespread conversion from grasslands to desert (Hoelzmann et al., 1998; Prentice et al., 2000; Sha et al., 2019), and the northernmost treeline had shifted poleward again to about 1° to 3° latitude north of its current location (MacDonald et al., 2000; Binney et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2011). Over the past half century, there has been an increase in the spatial synchrony of annual tree growth across all continents that is unprecedented during the past millennium (Manzanedo et al., 2020). Elevated rates of vegetation change in the Holocene are consistent with climate variability (Shuman et al., 2019), intensified human land use (Fyfe et al., 2015; Marquer et al., 2017), and resulting increased ecosystem novelty (Finsinger et al., 2017; K.D. Burke et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Long-term ecological records capture extensive range shifts during the 20th and early 21st centuries (Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Pecl et al., 2017). Research has been most extensive for North America and western Eurasia, with fewer studies for central Africa, eastern Asia, South America, Greenland, and Antarctica (Lenoir and Svenning, 2015). Most documented changes are toward cooler conditions – that is, poleward and upslope (Lenoir et al., 2008; Harsch et al., 2009; Elmendorf et al., 2015; Parmesan and Hanley, 2015; Evans and Brown, 2017). Notably, a large, quasi-global analysis (Chen et al., 2011) estimated that many insect, bird, and plant species had shifted by 17 (±3) km per decade toward higher latitudes and 11 (±2) m per decade toward higher elevations since the mid-20th century, with changes in both the leading and trailing edges of species ranges (Rumpf et al., 2018). Over the past century, long-term ecological surveys also show that species turnover (i.e., the total number of gains and losses of species within an area) has significantly increased across a broad array of ecosystems (Dornelas et al., 2014, 2019), including undisturbed montane areas worldwide (Gibson-Reinemer et al., 2015). Despite global losses to biodiversity, however, most local assemblages have experienced a change in biodiversity rather than a systematic loss (Pimm et al., 2014). With increased species turnover, the novelty of contemporary communities relative to historical baselines has risen (Hobbs et al., 2009; Radeloff et al., 2015) due to greater spatial homogenization, mixtures of exotic and native species, altered disturbance regimes, and legacies of current or historic land use (Olden and Rooney, 2006; Schulte et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2013; Goring et al., 2016). In general, terrestrial species have had lower rates of turnover than marine species (Dornelas et al., 2018; Blowes et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"There are exceptions to the general pattern of poleward/upslope migration. For some species, various biotic and abiotic factors (such as precipitation and land use) supersede the physiological effects of temperature (Vanderwal et al., 2013; Gibson-Reinemer and Rahel, 2015; Ordonez et al., 2016; Scheffers et al., 2016; Lenoir et al., 2020). For other species, poleward migration is slower than expectations from the observed temperature increases. Trees are one such example because of their long lifespan and gradual maturity (Renwick and Rocca, 2015); in fact, poleward advance is only evident at about half of the sites in a large global dataset of treeline dynamics for 1900-present (Harsch et al., 2009). Furthermore, the northernmost extent of treeline at present (roughly 73°N) is actually somewhat south of its location in the MH (MacDonald et al., 2008) despite an expanding growing season in the extratropical NH since the mid-20th century (Section 2.3.4.3.1)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Consistent with species range shifts, SRCCL noted that there have been changes in the geographical distribution of climate zones. Poleward shifts in temperate and continental climates are evident across the globe over 1950–2010, with decreases in the area (and increases in the average elevation) of polar climates (Chan and Wu, 2015). Zonal changes towards higher latitudes in winter plant hardiness regions are apparent since the 1970s over the central and eastern USA, with elevational changes also being important in the western USA (Daly et al., 2012). A clear northward shift in winter plant hardiness zones is detectable across western Canada since 1930, with somewhat lesser changes in the south-eastern part of the country (McKenney et al., 2014). A northward migration of agro-climate zones is also evident over Europe since the mid-1970s (Ceglar et al., 2019). In addition, a shift toward more arid climate zones is apparent in some areas, such as the Asian monsoon region (Son and Bae, 2015) as well as parts of South America and Africa (Spinoni et al., 2015)."

wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Vegetation index data derived from AVHRR and MODIS depicts increases in aspects of vegetation greenness (i.e., green leaf area and/or mass) over the past four decades (Piao et al., 2020). NDVI increased globally from the early 1980s through the early 2010s (Y. Liu et al., 2015a). N. Pan et al. (2018) found NDVI increases over about 70% of the Earth’s vegetated surface through 2013, and Osborne et al. (2018) noted strong upward changes in NDVI in the circumpolar Arctic through 2016. Globally integrated Leaf Area Index (LAI) also rose from the early 1980s through at least the early 2010s (Zhu et al., 2016; Forzieri et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017) and probably through near-present; for example, C. Chen et al. (2019) documented an LAI increase over one-third of the global vegetated area from 2000–2017. Although less frequently analysed for temporal trends, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) likewise increased over many global land areas (particularly China, India, and eastern Europe) in the past two decades (Figure 2.33; Forkel et al., 2014; Gobron, 2018; Keenan and Riley, 2018). There are also documented changes in specific vegetation types, such as a 7% rise in global tree cover for 1982–2016 (Song et al., 2018) and an expansion of shrub extent in the Arctic tundra over 1982–2017 (Myers-Smith et al., 2020). The increased greening is largely consistent with CO2 fertilization at the global scale, with other changes being noteworthy at the regional level (Piao et al., 2020); examples include agricultural intensification in China and India (X. Chen et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019) and temperature increases in the northern high latitudes (Kong et al., 2017; Keenan and Riley, 2018) and in other areas such as the Loess Plateau in central China (Y. Wang et al., 2018). Notably, some areas (such as parts of Amazonia, central Asia, and the Congo basin) have experienced browning (i.e., decreases in green leaf area and/or mass) (Hoogakker et al., 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019). Because rates of browning have exceeded rates of greening in some regions since the late 1990s, the increase in global greening has been somewhat slower in the last two decades (T.-Y. Pan et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Global-scale linear trends differ substantially across products for the same periods and trend metrics used (Jiang et al., 2017). Several factors contribute to this large span in estimated changes. Remotely sensed vegetation products vary in their spatial and temporal completeness as well as resolution and are sensitive to contamination from atmospheric composition, clouds, snow cover, and anisotropy, as well as orbital changes and sensor degradations (de Jong et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017; N. Pan et al., 2018). Ground-based measurements suitable for calibration and validation are scarce before 2000 (Xiao et al., 2017), and the recalibration of satellite records (e.g., as in from MODIS Collection 5 to 6) can affect trends (Piao et al., 2020). It is possible that the increase in greenness over 2000–2015 is larger than the increase in gross primary production (based on flux tower measurements and MODIS Collection 6 data) (L. Zhang et al., 2018). Land use changes and altered disturbance regimes (e.g., floods, fires, diseases) may mask large-scale signals (Franklin et al., 2016). In addition, there is a plethora of models for the identification of phenological metrics from satellite data as well as a variety of statistical techniques for analysing historical changes (S. Wang et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is  high confidence that vegetation greenness (i.e., green leaf area and/or mass) has increased globally since the early 1980s. However, there is low confidence in the magnitude of this increase owing to the large range in available estimates."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 noted that because CO2 uptake by photosynthesis occurs only during the growing season, the greater land mass in the NH imparts a characteristic ‘sawtooth’ seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO2. The SRCCL similarly stated that due to strong seasonal patterns of growth, NH terrestrial ecosystems are largely responsible for the seasonal variations in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Neither AR5 nor SRCCL made a confidence statement about observed changes in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of CO2."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"In situ observations of CO2 generally depict a rising amplitude of the seasonal cycle over the past half century, especially north of about 45°N (Figure 2.30). For example, an amplitude increase of 6 ± 2.6% per decade has been observed at the Barrow surface observatory in Alaska over 1961–2011 (Graven et al., 2013), with slightly slower increases thereafter. Aircraft data north of 45°N exhibit an amplitude increase of 57 ± 7% at 500 mb versus an increase of 26 ± 18% for 35°N–45°N between field campaigns in 1958–1961 and 2009–2011 (Graven et al., 2013). Increases in amplitude for the period 1980–2012 are apparent at eight surface observatories north of 50°N (Piao et al., 2018), related primarily to a larger drawdown in June and July. Trends in seasonal cycle amplitude at lower latitudes are smaller (if present at all); for instance, the increase at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since the early 1960s is only about half as large as at Barrow (Graven et al., 2013), and only one other low-latitude observatory has a significant increase from 1980–2012 (Piao et al., 2018). There is a weak signal of an increase in amplitude at the Sinhagad observatory in western India in recent years (Chakraborty et al., 2020). Generally speaking, larger increases in the Arctic and boreal regions are indicative of changes in vegetation and carbon cycle dynamics in northern ecosystems (Forkel et al., 2016), though increased carbon uptake can also result from other factors such as warmer- and wetter-than-normal conditions."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recent satellite-based, global-scale estimates of seasonal variations in atmospheric CO2 for the period 2003–2018 show that the seasonal variations in the SH are out of phase with those in the NH (Reuter et al., 2020), which is consistent with the phenological shifts in primary productivity between hemispheres. The net effect of the phase shift between the two hemispheres is to dampen the amplitude of the global average seasonal cycle. These integrated results also show that the amplitude of the oscillations has been increasing in the SH, from about 2009, but comparison with data from Baring head suggests that periods of high seasonal oscillation had occurred at that location in the SH prior to 1995."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is very  high confidence that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 has increased at mid-to-high NH latitudes since the early 1960s. The observed increase is generally consistent with greater greening during the growing season and an increase in the length of the growing season over the high northern latitudes. Similarly, globally-integrated results from the SH also show an increase in seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 signal, from around 2009 to 2018 (low confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"SROCC pointed out that long-term global observations of many key ocean variables, including phytoplankton, have not reached the density and accuracy necessary for detecting change. But SROCC noted the good comparability between short time-scale single-sensor ocean-colour products and a longer time-scale, climate-quality time series of multi-sensor, inter-sensor-bias-corrected, and error-characterized, global data on chlorophyll-a concentration in the surface layers of the ocean. With respect to oligotrophic gyres, AR5 WGII concluded that the oligotrophic subtropical gyres of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are expanding and that they indicate declining phytoplankton stocks in these waters (limited evidence, low agreement). With respect to distributions of marine organisms, AR5 WGII reported range shifts of benthic, pelagic, and demersal species and communities (high confidence), though the shifts were not uniform."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Phytoplankton are responsible for marine primary production through photosynthesis; they are a major player in the ocean carbon cycle. They have a high metabolic rate and respond fast to changes in environmental conditions (light, temperature, nutrients, mixing), and as such, serve as a key indicator for change in marine ecosystems. Concentration of chlorophyll-a, the major photosynthetic pigment in all phytoplankton, is often used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass. As primary producers, they are also food for organisms at higher trophic levels. The multi-sensor time series of chlorophyll-a concentration has now been updated (Sathyendranath et al., 2019) to cover 1998–2018. Figure 2.31 shows that global trends in chlorophyll-a for the last two decades are insignificant over large areas of the global ocean (von Schuckmann et al., 2019), but some regions exhibit significant trends, with positive trends in parts of the Arctic and the Antarctic waters (>3% yr–1), and both negative and positive trends (within ± 3% yr–1) in parts of the tropics, subtropics and temperate waters. The interannual variability in chlorophyll-a data in many regions is strongly tied to indices of climate variability (Section 2.4 and Annex IV) and changes in total concentration are typically associated with changes in phytoplankton community structure (e.g., Brewin et al., 2012; Racault et al., 2017b). Variability in community structure related to El Niño has, in turn, been linked to variability in fisheries, for example in the catch of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) in the Humboldt current ecosystem (Jackson et al., 2011)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 WGII, analysis of a longer time series of ocean-colour data (1998–2012) has shown (Aiken et al., 2017) that the expansion of the low nutrient part of the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre was significant, at 0.27 × 106km2 per decade, but that the rate was much lower than that reported earlier by Polovina et al. (2008). Furthermore, Aiken et al. (2017) reported no significant trend in the oligotrophic area of the South Atlantic Gyre. With the time series extended to 2016, von Schuckmann et al. (2018) reported that since 2007, there was a general decreasing trend in the areas of the North and South Pacific oligotrophic Gyres, while the North and South Atlantic oligotrophic Gyres remained stable, with little change in area, consistent with Aiken et al .  (2017). The changing sign of trends in the areal extent of the oligotrophic gyres with increase in the length of the time series raises the possibility that these changes arise from interannual to multi-decadal variability. The time series of ocean-colour data is too short to discern any trend that might be superimposed on such variability."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Similarly, there is limited consistent and long-term information on large-scale distributions of marine organisms at higher trophic levels. But there are increased indications since AR5 and SROCC that the distributions of various higher trophic-level organisms are shifting both polewards and to deeper levels (Edwards et al., 2016; Haug et al., 2017; Atkinson et al., 2019; Lenoir et al., 2020; Pinsky et al., 2020), mostly consistent with changes in temperature. However observations also show a smaller set of counter-intuitive migrations towards warmer and shallower waters, which could be related to changes in phenology and in larval transport by currents (Fuchs et al., 2020). There are also strengthening indications of greater representation by species with warm-water affinity in marine communities, consistent with expectations under observed warming (Burrows et al., 2019). There are indications that pre-1850 CE plankton communities are different from their modern counterparts globally (Jonkers et al., 2019). Indicators of geographical distributions of species (mostly from coastal waters) suggest that the rates at which some species are leaving or arriving at an ecosystem are variable, leading to changes in community composition (Blowes et al., 2019), with likely greater representation of warm-water species in some locations (Burrows et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is  high confidence that the latitudinal and depth limits of the distribution of various organisms in the marine biome are changing. There is medium confidence that there are differences in the responses of individual species relative to each other, such that the species compositions of ecosystems are changing. There is medium confidence that chlorophyll concentration in the surface shows weak negative and positive trends in parts of low and mid latitudes, and weak positive trends in some high-latitude areas. There is medium confidence that the large-scale distribution of the oligotrophic gyre provinces is subject to significant inter-annual variations, but low confidence in the long-term trends in the areal extent of these provinces because of insufficient length of direct observations."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"SROCC expressed low confidence in satellite-based estimates of trends in marine primary production, citing insufficient length of the time series and lack of corroborating in situ measurements and independent validation time series.

wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Recent model-based results with assimilation of satellite data (Gregg and Rousseaux, 2019), show global annual mean marine primary production of around 38 (±1.13) PgC yr–1 over 1998–2015. This new result lies towards the low end of values reported in earlier, satellite-based, studies (range 36.5–67 PgC yr–1, reported in Sathyendranath et al. (2020)). Reconciling the results of Gregg and Rousseaux (2019) with earlier satellite-based studies leads to a mean of 47 (±7.8) PgC yr–1. There is a strong correlation between interannual regional variability in marine primary production and climate variability (Racault et al., 2017b; Gregg and Rousseaux, 2019). The increase in primary production in the Arctic has been associated with retreating sea ice and with increases in nutrient supply and chlorophyll concentration (Lewis et al., 2020). Gregg and Rousseaux (2019) reported a decreasing trend in marine primary production, of –0.8 PgC (–2.1%) per decade globally. There is low confidence in this trend because of the small number of studies and the short length of the time series (<20 years)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In conclusion, there is low confidence because of the small number of recent studies and the insufficient length of the time series analysed that marine primary production is 47 (± 7.8) PgC yr–1. A small decrease in productivity is evident globally for the period 1998–2015, but regional changes are larger and of opposing signs (low confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Phenology is the study of the timing of important events in the annual life cycle of organisms (plants or animals; see also Annex VII: Glossary). The AR5 WGII noted that the timing of various seasonal biological events in the ocean had advanced by more than four days per decade over the previous 50-year period and concluded that there was  high confidence in observed changes in the phenological metrics of marine organisms. The AR5 WGII further reported that, of those observations that showed a response, 81% of changes in phenology, distribution and abundance were consistent with anticipated responses to climate warming according to theoretical expectations, corroborated by updates in SROCC. The consequent current and future impacts on interactions between species, including competition and predator-prey dynamics, were noted with  high confidence."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are additional indications that phenological metrics related to different species are changing, but not always in a similar manner. For example, many seabirds are breeding earlier, while others are breeding later (Sydeman et al., 2015). Planktonic organisms in the North Atlantic are also responding differently to each other when subjected to the same environmental changes (Edwards and Richardson, 2004). Furthermore, different factors could be responsible for triggering phenological responses in different stages in the life cycle of a single organism (Koeller et al., 2009). The shift in the distribution of many benthic invertebrates on the North-west Atlantic shelf, including some commercially important shellfish, could be explained by phenology and larval transport, and the shift and contraction of species range have been associated with higher mortality (Fuchs et al., 2020). Changes in phytoplankton phenological indicators globally (Racault et al., 2012; Sapiano et al., 2012) have been linked to indicators of climate variability, such as the multivariate ENSO Index (Racault et al., 2017a), with responses varying across ecological provinces of the ocean (Longhurst, 2007)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Phenological links between multiple components of an ecosystem have to be maintained intact, to retain system integrity. Since all higher pelagic organisms depend on phytoplankton for their food, either directly or indirectly, a match favours survival, and a mismatch is antagonistic to survival. Match represents synchronicity in the phenological events of both prey and predator. There are indications from ocean-colour data used in conjunction with fisheries data that the survival rate of various larger marine organisms depends on phenological metrics related to the seasonality of phytoplankton growth. Such links have been demonstrated, for example, for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in the North-west Atlantic (Platt et al., 2003); northern shrimp in the North Atlantic (Koeller et al., 2009; Ouellet et al., 2011); sardine (Sardinella aurita) off the Ivory coast (Kassi et al., 2018); cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae in the North-West Atlantic (Trzcinski et al., 2013); and oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps) off the south-west coast of India. Borstad et al. (2011) showed that fledgling production rate of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) on a remote island in coastal north-eastern Pacific was related to seasonal values of chlorophyll-a biomass in the vicinity of the island."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"In summary, new in situ data as well as satellite observations strengthen AR5 and SROCC findings that various phenological metrics for many species of marine organisms have changed in the last half century (high confidence), though many regions and many species of marine organisms remain under-sampled or even unsampled. The changes vary with location and with species (high confidence). There is a strong dependence of survival in higher trophic-level organisms (fish, exploited invertebrates, birds) on the availability of food at various stages in their life cycle, which in turn depends on phenologies of both (high confidence). There is a gap in our understanding of how the varied responses of marine organisms to climate change, from a phenological perspective, might threaten the stability and integrity of entire ecosystems."

Over the NH as a whole, an increase of about 2.0 days per decade is evident for 1951–2018 (Dunn et al., 2020), with slightly larger increases north of 45°N (Barichivich et al., 2013). Over North America, a rise of about 1.3 days per decade is apparent in the United States for 1900–2014 (Kukal and Irmak, 2018), with larger increases after 1980 (McCabe et al., 2015); likewise, all ecozones in Canada experienced increases from 1950–2010 (Pedlar et al., 2015). Growing season length in China increased by at least 1.0 days per decade since 1960 (Xia et al., 2018) and by several days per decade in South Korea since 1970 (Jung et al., 2015). In general, changes in phenological indicators are consistent with the increase in growing season length documented by instrumental data (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015). Several long-term, site-specific records illustrate the unusualness of recent phenological changes relative to interannual variability; for example, peak bloom dates for cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan have occurred progressively earlier in the growing season in recent decades, as have grape harvest dates in Beaune, France (Figure 2.32)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Changes in the length of the photosynthetically active growing season (derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) are also evident over many land areas since the early 1980s. Increases of about 2.0 days per decade are apparent north of 45°N since the early 1980s (centred over mid-latitude Eurasia and north-eastern North America), with indications of a reversal to a decline in season length starting in the early 2000s (Barichivich et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015; Garonna et al., 2016; Q. Liu et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016). Satellite-based records suggest that most NH regions have experienced both an earlier start and a later end to the growing season, a finding supported by ground-based data (Piao et al., 2020). A number of studies also capture increases in growing season length over the Canadian Arctic (W. Chen et al., 2016), Fennoscandia (Høgda et al., 2013), most of Europe (Garonna et al., 2014), and parts of sub-Saharan Africa (Vrieling et al., 2013)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The general consistency between in situ and satellite estimates over the NH is noteworthy given that many factors independently contribute to uncertainty in observed changes. For example, there is no universally accepted definition of growing season length across in situ analyses; some define the growing season as the period based on a temperature threshold (e.g., 5°C) whereas others use the frost-free period. Spatial and temporal coverage can also affect conclusions based upon in situ studies (Donat et al., 2013b). For satellite analyses, uncertainties can be related to the satellite datasets themselves (e.g., satellite drift, sensor differences, calibration uncertainties, atmospheric effects); and to the methods for determining phenological metrics (e.g., start, end, and length of season; S. Wang et al., 2016)."

wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Paleoclimate reconstructions document large-scale biome shifts from the deep past through the Holocene (e.g., Hoogakker et al., 2016). The northernmost location of the treeline is a representative indicator in this regard (Figure 2.34). During the MPWP, boreal forest extended to the Arctic coast, with the northernmost treeline being about 4° to 10° latitude further north than at present; temperate forests and grasslands were also shifted poleward (with reduced tundra extent), while savannahs and woodlands were more expansive in Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1b; Salzmann et al., 2008, 2013; Sniderman et al., 2016; Andrae et al., 2018). During the LGM, tundra and steppe expanded whereas forests were globally reduced in extent (Prentice et al., 2000; Binney et al., 2017), the northern treeline being about 17° to 23° latitude south of its present-day location in most areas. During the LDT, pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and other climatic changes (Nolan et al., 2018; Fordham et al., 2020). By the MH, North Africa had experienced a widespread conversion from grasslands to desert (Hoelzmann et al., 1998; Prentice et al., 2000; Sha et al., 2019), and the northernmost treeline had shifted poleward again to about 1° to 3° latitude north of its current location (MacDonald et al., 2000; Binney et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2011). Over the past half century, there has been an increase in the spatial synchrony of annual tree growth across all continents that is unprecedented during the past millennium (Manzanedo et al., 2020). Elevated rates of vegetation change in the Holocene are consistent with climate variability (Shuman et al., 2019), intensified human land use (Fyfe et al., 2015; Marquer et al., 2017), and resulting increased ecosystem novelty (Finsinger et al., 2017; K.D. Burke et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Long-term ecological records capture extensive range shifts during the 20th and early 21st centuries (Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Pecl et al., 2017). Research has been most extensive for North America and western Eurasia, with fewer studies for central Africa, eastern Asia, South America, Greenland, and Antarctica (Lenoir and Svenning, 2015). Most documented changes are toward cooler conditions – that is, poleward and upslope (Lenoir et al., 2008; Harsch et al., 2009; Elmendorf et al., 2015; Parmesan and Hanley, 2015; Evans and Brown, 2017). Notably, a large, quasi-global analysis (Chen et al., 2011) estimated that many insect, bird, and plant species had shifted by 17 (±3) km per decade toward higher latitudes and 11 (±2) m per decade toward higher elevations since the mid-20th century, with changes in both the leading and trailing edges of species ranges (Rumpf et al., 2018). Over the past century, long-term ecological surveys also show that species turnover (i.e., the total number of gains and losses of species within an area) has significantly increased across a broad array of ecosystems (Dornelas et al., 2014, 2019), including undisturbed montane areas worldwide (Gibson-Reinemer et al., 2015). Despite global losses to biodiversity, however, most local assemblages have experienced a change in biodiversity rather than a systematic loss (Pimm et al., 2014). With increased species turnover, the novelty of contemporary communities relative to historical baselines has risen (Hobbs et al., 2009; Radeloff et al., 2015) due to greater spatial homogenization, mixtures of exotic and native species, altered disturbance regimes, and legacies of current or historic land use (Olden and Rooney, 2006; Schulte et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2013; Goring et al., 2016). In general, terrestrial species have had lower rates of turnover than marine species (Dornelas et al., 2018; Blowes et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"There are exceptions to the general pattern of poleward/upslope migration. For some species, various biotic and abiotic factors (such as precipitation and land use) supersede the physiological effects of temperature (Vanderwal et al., 2013; Gibson-Reinemer and Rahel, 2015; Ordonez et al., 2016; Scheffers et al., 2016; Lenoir et al., 2020). For other species, poleward migration is slower than expectations from the observed temperature increases. Trees are one such example because of their long lifespan and gradual maturity (Renwick and Rocca, 2015); in fact, poleward advance is only evident at about half of the sites in a large global dataset of treeline dynamics for 1900-present (Harsch et al., 2009). Furthermore, the northernmost extent of treeline at present (roughly 73°N) is actually somewhat south of its location in the MH (MacDonald et al., 2008) despite an expanding growing season in the extratropical NH since the mid-20th century (Section 2.3.4.3.1)."

Poleward shifts in temperate and continental climates are evident across the globe over 1950–2010, with decreases in the area (and increases in the average elevation) of polar climates (Chan and Wu, 2015). Zonal changes towards higher latitudes in winter plant hardiness regions are apparent since the 1970s over the central and eastern USA, with elevational changes also being important in the western USA (Daly et al., 2012). A clear northward shift in winter plant hardiness zones is detectable across western Canada since 1930, with somewhat lesser changes in the south-eastern part of the country (McKenney et al., 2014). A northward migration of agro-climate zones is also evident over Europe since the mid-1970s (Ceglar et al., 2019). In addition, a shift toward more arid climate zones is apparent in some areas, such as the Asian monsoon region (Son and Bae, 2015) as well as parts of South America and Africa (Spinoni et al., 2015)."

The SRCCL subsequently concluded that greening had increased globally over the past 2–3 decades (high confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Vegetation index data derived from AVHRR and MODIS depicts increases in aspects of vegetation greenness (i.e., green leaf area and/or mass) over the past four decades (Piao et al., 2020). NDVI increased globally from the early 1980s through the early 2010s (Y. Liu et al., 2015a). N. Pan et al. (2018) found NDVI increases over about 70% of the Earth’s vegetated surface through 2013, and Osborne et al. (2018) noted strong upward changes in NDVI in the circumpolar Arctic through 2016. Globally integrated Leaf Area Index (LAI) also rose from the early 1980s through at least the early 2010s (Zhu et al., 2016; Forzieri et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017) and probably through near-present; for example, C. Chen et al. (2019) documented an LAI increase over one-third of the global vegetated area from 2000–2017. Although less frequently analysed for temporal trends, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) likewise increased over many global land areas (particularly China, India, and eastern Europe) in the past two decades (Figure 2.33; Forkel et al., 2014; Gobron, 2018; Keenan and Riley, 2018). There are also documented changes in specific vegetation types, such as a 7% rise in global tree cover for 1982–2016 (Song et al., 2018) and an expansion of shrub extent in the Arctic tundra over 1982–2017 (Myers-Smith et al., 2020). The increased greening is largely consistent with CO2 fertilization at the global scale, with other changes being noteworthy at the regional level (Piao et al., 2020); examples include agricultural intensification in China and India (X. Chen et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019) and temperature increases in the northern high latitudes (Kong et al., 2017; Keenan and Riley, 2018) and in other areas such as the Loess Plateau in central China (Y. Wang et al., 2018). Notably, some areas (such as parts of Amazonia, central Asia, and the Congo basin) have experienced browning (i.e., decreases in green leaf area and/or mass) (Hoogakker et al., 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019). Because rates of browning have exceeded rates of greening in some regions since the late 1990s, the increase in global greening has been somewhat slower in the last two decades (T.-Y. Pan et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Global-scale linear trends differ substantially across products for the same periods and trend metrics used (Jiang et al., 2017). Several factors contribute to this large span in estimated changes. Remotely sensed vegetation products vary in their spatial and temporal completeness as well as resolution and are sensitive to contamination from atmospheric composition, clouds, snow cover, and anisotropy, as well as orbital changes and sensor degradations (de Jong et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017; N. Pan et al., 2018). Ground-based measurements suitable for calibration and validation are scarce before 2000 (Xiao et al., 2017), and the recalibration of satellite records (e.g., as in from MODIS Collection 5 to 6) can affect trends (Piao et al., 2020). It is possible that the increase in greenness over 2000–2015 is larger than the increase in gross primary production (based on flux tower measurements and MODIS Collection 6 data) (L. Zhang et al., 2018). Land use changes and altered disturbance regimes (e.g., floods, fires, diseases) may mask large-scale signals (Franklin et al., 2016). In addition, there is a plethora of models for the identification of phenological metrics from satellite data as well as a variety of statistical techniques for analysing historical changes (S. Wang et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.3.4.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is  high confidence that vegetation greenness (i.e., green leaf area and/or mass) has increased globally since the early 1980s. However, there is low confidence in the magnitude of this increase owing to the large range in available estimates."

This synthesis serves as an assessment of the evidence for change across the climate system as represented by the instrumental record and its unusualness in the longer-term context. Building upon previous sections assessing the observational evidence for each key indicator individually, this section integrates the evidence across multiple indicators to arrive at a holistic and robust final assessment."
wg1_ch02_2.3.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate has varied across a broad range of timescales (Figure 2.34). During the Cenozoic Era temperatures generally decreased over tens of millions of years, leading to the development of ice sheets. During the last two million years, climate has fluctuated between glacials and interglacials. Within the current Holocene interglacial and, with increasing detail in the CE, it is possible to reconstruct a history both of more indicators of the climate system and, with increasing fidelity, the rates of change. Solely for the last 150 years or so are instrumental observations of globally distributed climate indicators available. However, only since the late 20th century have observational systems attained essentially global monitoring capabilities. The direct observations point unequivocally to rapid change across many indicators of the climate system since the mid-19th century. These are all consistent in indicating a world that has warmed rapidly."
wg1_ch02_2.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Assessing the long-term context of recent changes is key to understanding their potential importance and implications. The climate system consists of many observable aspects that vary over a very broad range of timescales. Some biogeochemical indicators of change such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations and ocean pH have shifted rapidly and CO2 concentrations are currently at levels unseen in at least 800 kyr (the period of continuous polar ice-core records) and very likely  for millions of years. The GMST in the past decade is likely  warmer than it has been on a centennially-averaged basis in the CE and more likely than not since the peak of the LIG. Many more integrative components of the climate system (e.g., glaciers, GMSL) are experiencing conditions unseen in millennia, whereas the most slowly responding components (e.g., ice-sheet extent, permafrost, tree line) are at levels unseen in centuries (high confidence). The rate at which several assessed climate indicators (e.g., GMSL, OHC, GSAT) have changed over recent decades is highly unusual in the context of preceding slower changes during the current post-glacial period (high confidence)."

This Cross-Chapter Box focuses on a single paleoclimate reference period as an example of how proxy data, models and process understanding come together to form a more complete representation of a warm climate state that occurred during the relatively recent geologic past."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The Pliocene Epoch is one of the best-documented examples of a warmer world during which the slow responding components of the climate system were approximately in balance with concentrations of atmospheric CO2, similar to present (e.g., Haywood et al., 2016). It provides a means to constrain Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (Section 7.5.3) and to assess climate model simulations (Section 7.4.4.1.2). During the Pliocene, continental configurations were similar to present (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 Figure 1a), and many plant and animal species living then also exist today. These similarities increase reliability of paleo-environmental reconstructions compared with those for older geological periods. Within the well-studied mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP, also called the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period, 3.3–3.0 Ma), the interglacial period KM5c (3.212–3.187 Ma) has become a focus of research because its orbital configuration, and therefore insolation forcing, was similar to present (global mean insolation = –0.022 W m–2 relative to modern; Haywood et al., 2013), allowing for the climatic state associated with relatively high atmospheric CO2 to be assessed with fewer confounding variables."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"During the KM5c interglacial, atmospheric CO2 concentration was typically between 360 and 420 ppm (Section 2.2.3.1). New climate simulations of this interval from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2) show a multi-model mean global surface air temperature of 3.2 [2.1 to 4.8] °C warmer than control simulations (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1a; Haywood et al., 2020). This is consistent with proxy evidence for the broader MPWP, which indicates that global mean surface temperature was 2.5°C–4.0°C higher than 1850–1900 (Section 2.3.1.1.1). Global mean sea level was between 5 and 25 m higher than present (Section 2.3.3.3). Geological evidence (Section 2.3.2.4) and ice-sheet modelling (Section 9.6.2) indicate that both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets were substantially smaller than present (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1c). Attribution of sea level highstands to particular ice-sheet sources (Section 9.6.2) is challenging (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Golledge, 2020), but improving (Berends et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.4_p9,NO_TITLE,"The latitudinal temperature gradient during the MPWP was reduced relative to present-day and the consistency between proxy and modelled temperatures has improved since AR5 (Section 7.4.4.1.2). Northern high latitude (>60°N) SSTs were up to 7°C higher than 1850–1900 (Bachem et al., 2016; McClymont et al., 2020; Sánchez-Montes et al., 2020), and terrestrial biomes were displaced poleward (e.g., Dowsett et al., 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1b). Arctic tundra regions currently underlain by permafrost were warm enough to support boreal forests, which shifted northward by approximately 250 km in Siberia, and up to 2000 km in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Salzmann et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2017). The shift caused high-latitude surface albedo changes, which further amplified the Pliocene global warming (Zhang and Jiang, 2014). Vegetation changes in north-east Siberia indicate that MPWP summer temperatures were up to 6°C higher than present day (Brigham-Grette et al., 2013). Farther south, modern boreal forest regions in Russia and eastern North America were covered with temperate forests and grasslands, whereas highly diverse, warm-temperate forests with subtropical taxa were widespread in central and eastern Europe (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1). While seasonal sea ice was present in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, its winter extent was reduced relative to present (Knies et al., 2014; Clotten et al., 2018), and some models suggest that the Arctic was sea ice free during the summer (Howell et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.4_p11,NO_TITLE,"The average longitudinal temperature gradient in the tropical Pacific was weaker during the Pliocene than during 1850–1900 (Section 7.4.4.2.2). Changes in Pacific SSTs and SST gradients had far-reaching impacts on regional climates through atmospheric teleconnections, affecting rainfall patterns in western North America (Burls and Fedorov, 2017; Ibarra et al., 2018). The reduced zonal SST gradient has led to suggestions that the Pliocene Pacific experienced a ‘permanent El Niño’ state (Molnar and Cane, 2002; Fedorov, 2006). However, there is no direct geological evidence, nor support from climate models, that ENSO variability collapsed during the Pliocene. Although not located in the centre-of-action region for ENSO, Pliocene corals show temperature variability over 3–7 year timescales (Watanabe et al., 2011). In addition, a multi-model intercomparison indicates that ENSO existed, albeit with reduced variability (Brierley, 2015). Thus, there is  high confidence that ENSO variability existed during the Pliocene."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.4_p13,NO_TITLE,"Vegetation reconstructions for the late Pliocene indicate regionally wetter conditions resulting in an expansion of tropical savannas and woodlands in Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1b). PlioMIP2 climate models generally simulate higher rates of mean annual precipitation in the tropics and high latitudes, and a decrease in the subtropics, with a multi-model mean global increase of 0.19 [0.13–0.32] mm day–1 relative to control simulations (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1a; Haywood et al., 2020). Both simulations and limitedproxyevidence indicate stronger monsoons in northern Africa, Asia, and northern Australia relative to present, but trends are uncertain in other monsoon regions (X. Li et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; X. Huang et al., 2019a; R. Zhang et al., 2019). There is thus medium confidence that monsoon systems were stronger during the Pliocene. Simulations of MPWP climate show that global tropical cyclone intensity and duration increased during the MPWP (Yan et al., 2016); however, there is low confidence in this result because inter-model variability is high."
wg1_ch02_cross-chapter-box-2.4_p15,NO_TITLE,"During the MPWP (3.3–3.0 Ma) the atmospheric CO2 concentration was similar to present, and the slow-response, large-scale indicators reflect a world that was warmer than present. With very high confidence, relative to present, global surface temperature, sea level, and precipitation rate were higher, NH latitudinal temperature gradient was lower, and major terrestrial biomes expanded poleward. With medium confidence from proxy-based evidence alone (Section 2.3.2), combined with numerical modelling, analysis of the sea-level budget, and process understanding (Section 9.6.2), there is  high confidence that cryospheric indicators were diminished. There is medium confidence that the Pacific longitudinal temperature gradient was weaker and monsoon systems were stronger."

wg1_ch02_2.4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 reported that the shift towards a positive NAO, a mode of variability in the North Atlantic that is closely related to the hemispheric-scale NAM, from the 1950s to the 1990s was largely reversed by more recent changes (high confidence). Moreover, periods of persistent negative or positive NAO states observed during the latter part of the 20th century were not unusual, based on NAO reconstructions spanning the last half millennium (high confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"New multi-millennial-timescale NAO reconstructions are derived from marine and lake sediments, speleothems, tree rings and ice cores (Ortega et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Sjolte et al., 2018). NAO variability over the past 8 kyr suggests the presence of a significant 1.5 kyr periodicity (Darby et al., 2012). Positive NAO conditions dominated during the MH, while the prevailing NAO sign during the early and late Holocene was negative according to most reconstructions (Olsen et al., 2012; Ait Brahim et al., 2019; Røthe et al., 2019; Hernández et al., 2020). For the CE, reconstructions developed since AR5 indicate no dominant NAO phase during 1000–1300 CE (Jones et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2015; Ortega et al., 2015; Lasher and Axford, 2019; Hernández et al., 2020), with either negative (Baker et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019) or a more variable phase of the NAO (Jones et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2015; Sjolte et al., 2018; Cook et al., 2019) between 1400 and 1850 CE. Several instrument-based NAO reconstructions extending back to the 17th and 18th centuries highlight the presence of multi-decadal variations in the NAO phases (Cornes et al., 2013; Cropper et al., 2015), although these studies have limitations considering the seasonality of the centres of action and the locations of the stations used. Recent reconstructions of the large scale sea level pressure field yield more robust NAO analysis, showing a persistently negative NAO phase from the 1820s to the 1870s, with positive values dominating during the beginning of the 20th century followed by a declining trend over 1920–1970, with a recovery thereafter to a period of consistently high values between 1970 and the early 1990s (Delaygue et al., 2019; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019). Based on the evaluation of several NAO reconstructions for recent centuries, Hernández et al. (2020) highlighted that the strong positive NAO phases of the 1990s and early 21st century were not unusual."
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The predominantly positive phase during the 1990s was followed by partial reversal and a tendency towards stronger variability in boreal winter NAM and NAO since the late 1990s (Pinto and Raible, 2012; Hanna et al., 2018). This is particularly evident in December NAO (Hanna et al., 2015) and NAM (Overland and Wang, 2015) indices, and is not unusual on multi-decadal time scales (Woollings et al., 2018a). Since the 1990s, a statistically significant summer NAO decline was reported, which is, to a lesser extent, also evident in the winter NAO, linked to an enhanced blocking activity over Greenland (Hanna et al., 2015, 2016; Wachowicz et al., 2021). However, this was moderated by persistent positive NAO values since 2015 (Annex IV.2.1). Based on observations and reanalysis datasets, multi-decadal variations were found for the NAM patterns: the Atlantic centre remained unchanged throughout 1920–2010, whereas the Pacific centre was stronger during 1920–1959 and 1986–2010 and weaker during 1960–1985 (Gong et al., 2018). Multidecadal changes were also observed in the position of the centres of action of the NAO (Moore et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"In summary, positive trends for the NAM/NAO winter indices were observed between the 1960s and the early 1990s, but these indices have become less positive or even negative thereafter (high confidence).

wg1_ch02_2.4.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,The AR5 concluded that it was likely  that the SAM had become more positive since the 1950s and that this increase was unusual in the context of the prior 400 years (medium confidence). Both AR5 and SROCC reported statistically significant trends in the SAM during the instrumental period for the austral summer and autumn.
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several studies have attempted to reconstruct the evolution of the SAM during the Holocene using proxies of the position and strength of the SH zonal winds, although with no clear consensus regarding the timing and phase of the SAM (Hernández et al., 2020). The early Holocene was dominated by SAM positive phases (Moreno et al., 2018; Reynhout et al., 2019), consistent with increasing westerly wind strength (Lamy et al., 2010), with some reconstructions showing significant centennial and millennial variability but no consistent trend after 5 ka (Hernández et al., 2020). For the CE, enhanced westerly winds occurred over 0–1000 CE, as reflected in increased burning activity in Patagonia (Turney et al., 2016a) and tree ring records from southern New Zealand (Turney et al., 2016b) imply a predominantly positive SAM phase. Pollen records and lake sediments from Tasmania, southern mainland Australia, New Zealand and southern South America, inferred the period of 1000 to 1400 CE to be characterized by anomalously dry conditions south of 40°S, implying a positive SAM (Moreno et al., 2014; Fletcher et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019; Matley et al., 2020). Nevertheless, proxy reconstructions of the SAM based on temperature-sensitive records from tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals spanning the mid-to-polar latitudes show alternating positive and negative phases (Figure 2.35)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Prolonged periods of negative SAM values were identified during the period 1400–1700 CE in several reconstructions (Figure 2.35, Villalba et al., 2012; Abram et al., 2014; Dätwyler et al., 2018), with a minimum identified during the 15th century (Hernández et al., 2020), although some disagreements exist between proxy records before 1800 CE (Hessl et al., 2017). Abram et al. (2014) concluded that the mean SAM index during recent decades is at its highest levels for at least the last 1 kyr. Similarly, the summer SAM reconstruction by Dätwyler et al. (2018) indicates a strengthening over the last 60 years that is outside the very likely range of the last millennium natural variability. The largest 30- and 50-year trends in the annual SAM index occurred at the end of the 20th century (after 1969 and 1950 respectively), indicating that the recent increase in the SAM is unprecedented in the context of at least the past three centuries (Yang and Xiao, 2018)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Before the mid-1950s, SAM indices derived from station-based datasets, and centennial reanalyses show pronounced interannual and decadal variability but no significant trends, with low correlation between SAM indices due to the diversity across different datasets and sensitivity to the definition used for the index calculation (Barrucand et al., 2018; Schneider and Fogt, 2018; J. Lee et al., 2019). Various SAM indices exhibit significant positive trends since the 1950s, particularly during austral summer and autumn (Barrucand et al., 2018; Schneider and Fogt, 2018; J. Lee et al., 2019), unprecedented for austral summer over the last 150 years (J.M. Jones et al., 2016; Fogt and Marshall, 2020). This indicates a strengthening of the surface westerly winds around Antarctica, related to both the position and intensity of the subpolar jet in the SH (Section 2.3.1.4.3; Ivy et al., 2017; IPCC, 2019). The SAM trends have slightly weakened after about 2000 (Fogt and Marshall, 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, historical station-based reconstructions of the SAM show that there has been a robust positive trend in the SAM index, particularly since 1950 and for the austral summer (high confidence). The recent positive trend in the SAM is likely unprecedented in at least the past millennium, although medium confidence arises due to the differences between proxy records before 1800 CE."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 reported with medium confidence that ENSO-like variability existed, at least sporadically, during the warm background state of the Pliocene. It was also found (high confidence) that ENSO has remained highly variable during the last 7 kyr with no discernible orbital modulation. The AR5 concluded that large variability on interannual to decadal timescales, and differences between datasets, precluded robust conclusions on any changes in ENSO during the instrumental period. The SROCC reported epochs of strong ENSO variability throughout the Holocene, with no indications of a systematic trend in ENSO amplitude, but with some indication that the ENSO amplitude over 1979–2009 was greater than at any point in the period from 1590–1880 CE. It was also reported that the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the period from 1951–2000 was high relative to 1901–1950."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Manucharyan and Fedorov (2014) found that ENSO-like variability has been present, at least sporadically, during epochs of millions of years (including the MPWP; Cross-Chapter Box 2.4), with proxy records indicating that this was the case even when cross-Pacific SST gradients were much weaker than present. There is substantial disagreement between proxy records for ENSO activity during the early Holocene (Zhang et al., 2014; White et al., 2018), and for ENSO activity and mean state at the LGM (Leduc et al., 2009; Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Sadekov et al., 2013; Ford et al., 2015, 2018; Zhu et al., 2017; Tierney et al., 2020). A number of studies (Cobb et al., 2013; H. McGregor et al., 2013; Carré et al., 2014; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2017; White et al., 2018; Grothe et al., 2019) have found that ENSO was substantially weaker than at present at various times in the mid-Holocene within the period from 6 to 3 ka, with stronger decreases in variability revealed by remote proxies than by those close to the core region of ENSO activity. However, Karamperidou et al. (2015) find that weakening in ENSO-related variability in eastern Pacific proxies does not necessarily correspond to weakening in central Pacific proxies. Barrett et al. (2018) concluded that multi-proxy reconstructions are more efficient at identifying eastern Pacific than central Pacific events. This suggests that a weakening of proxy-based signals may indicate an along-equatorial shift in ENSO activity rather than a weakening of ENSO during some periods. Following the period of weak ENSO variability in the mid-Holocene, a number of studies find an increase in ENSO activity which, depending upon the study, commences between 4.4 and 3 ka (Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Cobb et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014; S. Chen et al., 2016; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021)."

Liu et al., 2017) find substantial variability in ENSO activity on multi-decadal to centennial timescales over the last 500 to 1 kyr (Figure 2.36). Different proxies show a wide spread in the specific timing and magnitude of events in the pre-instrumental period (e.g., Dätwyler et al., 2019). Most investigators find that ENSO activity in recent decades was higher than the most recent centuries prior to the instrumental period. Grothe et al. (2019) also found that ENSO variance of the last 50 years was 25% higher than the average of the last millennium, and was substantially higher than the average of the mid- to late-Holocene. S. McGregor et al., (2010, 2013) looked for common variance changes in pre-existing ENSO proxies, finding stronger ENSO variance for the 30-year period 1979–2009 compared to any 30-year period within the timespan 1590–1880 CE. This finding also holds when adding more recently developed ENSO proxies (Figure 2.36). Koutavas and Joanides (2012), Ledru et al. (2013) and Thompson et al. (2017) identify various periods within the range 1000 BCE to 1300 CE when ENSO activity was greater than in the following centuries, and more closely comparable to the mid-20th century onwards behaviour."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, updates to datasets used widely in prior ENSO assessments resulted in substantial and important revisions to observed tropical Pacific SST data (Section 2.3.1.1). In particular, ERSSTv4, and then ERSSTv5, addressed known SST biases in ERSSTv3 in the equatorial Pacific which affected the derived mean state and amplitude of indices based on that dataset (Huang et al., 2015). During the instrumental period, there is no robust indication of any significant century-scale trend in the east-west SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, with periods when gradients have been stronger and weaker than the long-term average on decadal timescales, associated with a predominance of La Niña or El Niño events respectively. The frequency of El Niño and La Niña events is also subject to considerable decadal variability (e.g., Hu et al., 2013) but with no indication of a long-term signal in the frequency of events. The ENSO amplitude since 1950 has increased relative to the 1910–1950 period, as confirmed by independent proxy records (e.g., Gergis and Fowler, 2009), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (Braganza et al., 2009) and SSTs (e.g., Ohba, 2013; Yu and Kim, 2013), although there is a spread between different proxy and instrumental sources as to the magnitude of that increase (Figure 2.36). The El Niño events of 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 had the strongest anomalies in the Niño 3.4 SST index since 1950. Their predominance was less evident from indices based on de-trended data such as the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) (which still ranked them as the three strongest events since 1950, but only by a small margin), and in the SOI. B. Huang et al. (2019a)  also note that analyses based upon buoy and Argo data, which are only available since the 1990s, are more capable of resolving strong events than analyses which do not include such data."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Prior to the 1950s, SST observations in the tropical Pacific were much sparser and hence uncertainties in Niño indices are much larger (B. Huang et al., 2020). SOI data and some newer SST-based studies show high ENSO amplitude, comparable to the post-1950 period, in the period from the mid-late 19th century to about 1910, but proxy indicators generally indicate that the late 19th and early 20th century were less active than the late 20th century (Figure 2.36). Yu and Kim’s (2013) implementation of the ONI found a number of events with the ONI above 1.5°C between 1888 and 1905, then no such events until 1972, whilst the SOI indicates comparable or stronger events to the three strongest post-1950 events in 1896 and 1905. Giese and Ray (2011) also found a number of such events between 1890 and 1920 in the SODA ocean reanalysis, corroborated further by B. Huang et al. (2020) and Vaccaro et al. (2021), who found that the strength of the 1877–1878 event was comparable with that of the 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 events. There have also been a number of strong La Niña events (e.g., 1973–1974, 1975–1976 and 2010–2011), with few clear analogues in the 1920–1970 period; the proxy-based analysis of McGregor et al. (2010) indicates that the mid-1970s La Niña period was also extreme in a multi-centennial context. There is no indication that the frequency of high-amplitude events since the 1970s reflects a long-term trend which can be separated from multi-decadal variability, given apparent presence of several high-amplitude events in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the relatively large uncertainty in pre-1950 SST data in the tropical Pacific region."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"There is a distinction (Annex IV.2.3.1) between El Niño events centred in the eastern Pacific (‘Eastern Pacific’ (EP) or ‘classical’ events) and those centred in the Central Pacific (‘Central Pacific’ (CP) or ‘Modoki’ events), which have different typical teleconnections (e.g., Ashok et al., 2007; Ratnam et al., 2014; Capotondi et al., 2015; Timmermann et al., 2018). A number of studies, using a range of indicators, have found an increase in recent decades of the fraction of CP El Niño events, particularly after 2000 (Yu and Kim, 2013; Lübbecke and McPhaden, 2014; Pascolini-Campbell et al., 2015; Jiang and Zhu, 2018). Johnson (2013) found that the frequency of CP El Niño events had increased (although not significantly) over the 1950–2011 period, being accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of La Niña events with a warm (as opposed to cool) western Pacific warm pool. A coral-based reconstruction starting in 1600 CE (Freund et al., 2019) found that the ratio of CP to EP events in the last 30 years was substantially higher than at any other time over the last 400 years. Variations in the proportion of CP and EP events have also been found in earlier periods, with Carré et al. (2014) finding a period of high CP activity around 7 ka."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"There is no robust indicationof any changes in ENSO teleconnections over multi-centennial timescales (Hernández et al., 2020) despite multi-decadal variability. Shi and Wang (2018) found that teleconnections with the broader Asian summer monsoon, including the Indian and the East Asian monsoon, were generally stable since the 17th century during the developing phase of the monsoon, and showed substantial decadal variability, but no clear trend, during the decaying phase. They also found that the weakening of teleconnections between the Indian summer monsoon and ENSO in recent decades had numerous precedents over the last few centuries. Räsänen et al. (2016) also found substantial decadal variability, but little trend, in the strength of the relationship between ENSO and monsoon precipitation in South East Asia between 1650 and 2000. Dätwyler et al. (2019) identified a number of multi-decadal periods with apparently changed teleconnections at times over the last 400 years."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"In the instrumental period, teleconnections associated with ENSO are well known to vary on decadal to multi-decadal timescales (e.g., He et al., 2013; Lee and Ha, 2015; Ashcroft et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019). Yun and Timmermann (2018) found that decadal variations in teleconnections between ENSO and the Indian monsoon did not extend beyond what would be expected from a stochastic process. Many observed decadal changes in teleconnections in the instrumental period are consistent with a shift to more central Pacific El Niño events (Evtushevsky et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2018; Yu and Sun, 2018; Zhao and Wang, 2019). Effects of the PDV (Kwon et al., 2013; S. Wang et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2018) and the AMV (Kayano et al., 2019) can also modulate ENSO teleconnections, and affect the frequency of CP versus EP events (Ashok et al., 2007). Chiodi and Harrison (2015) found that teleconnections over the most recent decades are broadly consistent with those over the last 100 years. Variability in teleconnections can also occur on timescales longer than characteristic PDV timescales (e.g., Gallant et al., 2013)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"In summary, there is medium confidence that both ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 are higher than over the period from 1850 and possibly as far back as 1400, but low confidence that they are outside the range of variability over periods prior to 1400, or higher than the average of the Holocene as a whole. Overall, there is no indication of a recent sustained shift in ENSO or associated features such as the Walker Circulation, or in teleconnections associated with these, being beyond the range of variability on decadal to millennial timescales. A high proportion of El Niño events in the last 20–30 years have been based in the central, rather than eastern Pacific, but there is low confidence that this represents a long-term change."
wg1_ch02_2.4.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 did not provide an assessment of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) records based on paleo reconstructions. For the instrumental era, AR5 reported that there were no trends in the IOD behaviour. However, the strength of the Indian Ocean Basin-wide (IOB) mode, quantified by the basin-scale averaged SST index, increased in all assessed periods except 1979–2012, but the AR5 neither quantified trends nor provided a confidence statement."
wg1_ch02_2.4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"For the LGM, enhanced equatorial Indian Ocean productivity in marine sediment records was associated with strengthened westerly jets, in line with a shallower central-western Indian Ocean thermocline and stronger negative IOD events (Punyu et al., 2014). The LGM Indian Ocean basin was substantially modified by the exposure of the tropical shelves (DiNezio et al., 2018) and this has been associated with an Indian Ocean ‘El Niño‘ (Thirumalai et al., 2019). Wurtzel et al. (2018) contend that during the LDT, including the Younger Dryas event, Indian Ocean precipitation did not mirror the zonal asymmetry observed in Indian Ocean SSTs in the Holocene based upon a speleothem record from Sumatra, but instead reflected shifts in moisture transport pathways and sources. Using Seychelles corals, representing the western pole of the IOD, spanning from the MH to present, Zinke et al. (2014) identified changes in seasonality, with the lowest seasonal SST range in the MH and then again around 2 ka, while the largest seasonal range occurred around 4.6 ka and then again during the near-present (1990–2003). Reconstructions from fossil corals for the eastern Indian Ocean point to stronger negative IOD SST anomalies due to the enhanced upwelling and cooling driven by a stronger monsoon with enhanced anomalous easterly winds in the eastern Indian Ocean during the MH (Abram et al., 2020b). Niedermeyer et al. (2014) from the analysis of stable isotopes in terrestrial plant waxes, suggest that the period 6.5 ka to 4.5 ka was characterized by an anomalously positive IOD mean state. During various parts of the Holocene, periods of a mean positive IOD-like state were associated with increased IOD variability, including events that exceed the magnitude of the strongest events during the instrumental period (Abram et al., 2020a)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"From the coralδ18O record from the Seychelles over 1854–1994, Du et al. (2014) showed a 3–7 year dominant period associated with the IOB in response to ENSO forcing. They identified multi-decadal variability in the IOB, with more active IOB phases during 1870–1890, 1930–1955, and 1975–1992, while decadal variability in the IOB dominated during 1940–1975 (Du et al., 2014). Evidence for changes in IOB characteristics during earlier periods (e.g., MH, LGM) is limited."
wg1_ch02_2.4.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The role of decadal to multi-decadal variability has recently emerged as an important aspect of the IOD with many indications of the effects of Pacific Ocean processes on IOD variability through atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms (Dong et al., 2016; Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2016; Zhou et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018). Positive events in the 1960s and 1990s were linked to a relatively shallow eastern Indian Ocean thermocline, and a primarily negative IOD state in the 1970s and 1980s was related to a deeper thermocline (Ummenhofer et al., 2016). Positive IOD events may have increased in frequency during the second half of the 20th century (Abram et al., 2020a, b). Earlier observations of apparent changes in the frequency and/or magnitude of the IOD events are considered unreliable, particularly prior to the 1960s (Hernández et al., 2020). Although the seasonal evolution and the type of ENSO (Section 2.4.2) may influence the character of the IOD (Guo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2016), the occurrence of some IOD events may be independent of ENSO (Sun et al., 2015)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"To summarize, there is low confidence in any multi-decadal IOD variability trend in the instrumental period due to data uncertainties especially before the 1960s. In addition to data uncertainties, understanding of the IOB variability during the instrumental period is also limited by large-scale warming of the Indian Ocean. Neither the IOD nor the IOB have exhibited behaviour outside the range implied by proxy records (low confidence)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 reported no changes in the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) during the 20th century or shorter periods thereof. For the Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), also referred as the Atlantic Niño, the AR5 reported increases during the 1950–2012 period but neither assessed trends nor provided a confidence statement. The AR5 did not assess paleo evidence for the AZM and AMM."
wg1_ch02_2.4.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Paleo-reconstructions of these two modes remain rather limited. Nonetheless, the interhemispheric cross-equatorial SST gradients linked to changes in ITCZ locations characteristic of the AMM has been found during the LGM, Heinrich Stadial 1, and the MH, with the largest shift occurring during HS1 (McGee et al., 2014). Similarly, the dipole-like SST pattern in the South Atlantic subtropics, which is related to the AZM (Venegas et al., 1996; Morioka et al., 2011; Nnamchi et al., 2016, 2017; Lübbecke et al., 2018; Rouault et al., 2018; Foltz et al., 2019), has been reconstructed using SST proxies from marine sediment cores during the past 12 kyr (Wainer et al., 2014). The reconstructed index captures two significant cold events that occurred during the 12.9–11.6 ka and 8.6–8.0 ka periods in the South Atlantic (Wainer et al., 2014)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"During the observational period the AZM and AMM (Figure 2.37) are related to the AMV largely controlling the interhemispheric gradient of the SST at decadal to multi-decadal timescales (Tokinaga and Xie, 2011; Polo et al., 2013; Svendsen et al., 2014a; Li et al., 2015; Lübbecke et al., 2018). The AZM interannual variability is enhanced (Lübbecke et al., 2018; Foltz et al., 2019), and is more strongly related to ENSO, during the negative phase of the AMV (Martín-Rey et al., 2014, 2018; Polo et al., 2015; Nnamchi et al., 2020). The AZM displayed a persistent weakened variability over the 1960–2009 period associated with declined cold tongue upwelling (Tokinaga and Xie, 2011), which became pronounced since 2000 (Prigent et al., 2020a, b). Despite these multi-decadal fluctuations, there is limited evidence for any sustained change in the AMM (Chang et al., 2011; Martín-Rey et al., 2018) and AZM (Martín-Rey et al., 2018; Nnamchi et al., 2020) during the instrumental period. The AZM and AMM interact on interannual timescales (Servain et al., 1999; Foltz and McPhaden, 2010; Pottapinjara et al., 2019) leading in 2009 to extremes of both modes in which the negative phase of the AMM (Foltz et al., 2012; Burmeister et al., 2016) preceded an equatorial cold tongue cold event that was unprecedented in the prior 30 years (Foltz and McPhaden, 2010; Burmeister et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"In summary,  confidence is low in any sustained changes to the AZM and AMM variability in instrumental observations. There is very low confidence in changes of the paleo AZM and AMM due to extremely limited availability of paleo reconstructions."
wg1_ch02_2.4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) refers to the ocean-atmosphere climate variability over the Pacific Ocean at decadal-to-interdecadal time scales and is usually described by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) indices. The AR5 and SROCC reported a large shift of the PDO in the late 1970s, with a predominantly positive phase until the end of the 1990s, being mainly negative afterwards. There was no significant change assessed in the PDO during the instrumental period as a whole, and no confidence level was assigned. Changes in the pre-instrumental era PDO were not assessed in AR5."
wg1_ch02_2.4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"The existence of the PDV in the centuries prior to the instrumental period is evidenced by a variety of proxy records based on tree rings (Biondi et al., 2001; D’Arrigo and Ummenhofer, 2015), corals (Felis et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2013; Linsley et al., 2015) and sediments (Lapointe et al., 2017; O’Mara et al., 2019). There is little coherence between the various paleo-proxy indices prior to the instrumental record, and neither these nor the instrumental records provide indications of a clearly defined spectral peak (Chen and Wallace, 2015; M. Newman et al., 2016; Henley, 2017; L. Zhang et al., 2018; Buckley et al., 2019). For instance, spectral analysis from millennia length PDV reconstructions shows spectral peaks at multi-decadal, centennial and bi-centennial time scales (Beaufort and Grelaud, 2017), while only multi-decadal oscillations can be detected in the shorter (less than 400 years into the past) paleoclimate reconstructions. A variety of proxies suggest a shift in the PDV from the early-mid Holocene, which was characterized by a persistently negative phase of the PDO (i.e., weak Aleutian Low), to the late Holocene, and more variable and more positive PDO (i.e., strong Aleutian Low) conditions. This shift at around 4.5 ka is also evident in the PDO periodicities, changing from bidecadal and pentadecadal variability in the early Holocene to only pentadecadal periodicities in the late Holocene (Hernández et al., 2020). Several proxy records indicate that the strengthening in the Aleutian Low inferred since the late 17th century is unprecedented over the last millennium (Z. Liu et al., 2017; Osterberg et al., 2017; Winski et al., 2017), in line with an increase in PDV low-frequency variability (Williams et al., 2017; Hernández et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"The PDO and IPO indices are significantly correlated during the instrumental period, showing regime shifts in the 1920s, 1940s, 1970s and around 1999. Positive PDV phases were observed from the 1920s to the mid-1940s and from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, while negative phases occurred from mid-1940s until the late 1970s, and since 1999 (Figure 2.38; Han et al., 2014; Chen and Wallace, 2015; M. Newman et al., 2016). The associated spatial patterns are quite similar, but the PDO pattern exhibits stronger SST anomalies in the extra-tropical North Pacific than the IPO (Chen and Wallace, 2015). The strength and structure of the SST patterns also differ among the periods (M. Newman et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Instrumental observations are sparse prior to 1950, and thus the fidelity of any PDV index derived for the second part of the 19th century and early decades of the 20th century is relatively low (Figure 2.38; Deng et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2014). This results inlow agreement in the classification of the PDO/IPO phase among several indices, even during recent years with the availability of high-quality data. Nevertheless, the teleconnection patterns are robust regardless of the index used to characterize the PDO (McAfee, 2017). Analysis of time series of PDO and IPO highlights the (multi-) decadal nature of this mode of variability with no significant trends, but highlights a recent switch from a positive to a negative phase since 1999/2000 across all indicators (England et al., 2014; Henley, 2017)."
wg1_ch02_2.4.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, the PDV in the instrumental record is dominated by (multi-)decadal-scale shifts between positive and negative phases over the last 150 years with no overall trend (high confidence). There is low confidence in paleo-PDV reconstructions due to discrepancies among the various available time series in terms of phasing and timing. However, there is  high confidence in the occurrence of a shift from predominantly negative to positive PDO conditions from the middle to the late Holocene."
wg1_ch02_2.4.6_p1,NO_TITLE,The AR5 reported no robust changes in Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) reconstructions based on paleo records due to low consistency between different AMV reconstructions prior to 1900. AR5 concluded that there have been no significant trends in the AMV index during the instrumental period and there was difficulty in interpreting the AMV signal because of the long-term underlying SST warming trend.
wg1_ch02_2.4.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 conclusions about large uncertainties in AMV paleo reconstructions (Hernández et al., 2020) have been reinforced by recent studies of tree rings (J.

The AMV exhibited a generally positive state over the first millennium of the CE (Mann et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2018). Paleo reconstructions over the last millennium consistently show a negative AMV phase during 1400–1850 CE and a positive phase during 900–1200 CE (Mann et al., 2009; J. Wang et al., 2017b; Singh et al., 2018), consistent with warmer surface temperatures from tropical Atlantic records (Kilbourne et al., 2014)."

The pattern and strength of the AMV differs among the periods (e.g., Svendsen et al., 2014b; Reynolds et al., 2018) and there are indications that there may have been a shift since 2005 toward a negative phase of the AMV (Robson et al., 2016)."
