wg1_ch05_5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The physical and biogeochemical controls of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a central motivation for this chapter, which identifies biogeochemical feedbacks that have led or could lead to a future acceleration, slowdown or abrupt transitions in the rate of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere, and therefore of climate change. A characterization of the trends and feedbacks lead to improved quantification for the remaining carbon budgets for climate stabilization, and the responses of the carbon cycle to atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which is embedded in many of the mitigation scenarios, to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement."
wg1_ch05_5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Changes in the abundance of well-mixed GHGs – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) – in the atmosphere play a large role in determining the Earth’s radiative properties and its climate in the past, the present and the future (Chapters 2, 4, 6 and 7). Since 1950, the increase in atmospheric GHGs has been the dominant cause of the human-induced climate change (Section 3.3). While the main driver of changes in atmospheric GHGs over the past 200 years relates to the direct emissions from human activities, the net accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere is controlled by biogeochemical source-sink dynamics of carbon that exchange between multiple reservoirs on land, oceans and atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change for the period 1750–2019 released an estimated 700 ± 75 PgC (1 PgC = 1015g of carbon) into the atmosphere, of which less than half remains in the atmosphere today (Sections 5.2.1.2; 5.2.1.5) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). This emphasizes the central role of terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks in regulating its atmospheric concentration (Ballantyne et al., 2012; W. Li et al., 2016; Le Quéré et al., 2018a; Ciais et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."

Significant advances have taken place since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), particularly in constraining the annual-to-decadal variability of the ocean and land carbon sources and sinks, and in revealing the sensitivity of carbon pools to current and future climate changes.

wg1_ch05_5.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The influence of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and emissions scenarios on the carbon–climate system is the primary driver of ocean and terrestrial sinks as the major negative feedbacks that determine the atmospheric CO2 levels, which then drive climate feedbacks through radiative forcing (Figure 5.2) (Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2013; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). Biogeochemical feedbacks follow as an outcome of both carbon and climate forcing on the physics and the biogeochemical processes of the ocean and terrestrial carbon cycles (Figure 5.2) (Katavouta et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2019; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). Together, these carbon–climate feedbacks can amplify or suppress climate change by altering the rate at which CO2 builds up in the atmosphere through changes in the land and ocean sources and sinks (Figure 5.2; C.D. Jones et al., 2013; Raupach et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2019). These changes depend on the, often non-linear, interaction of the drivers (CO2 and climate) and processes in the ocean and land as well as the emissions scenarios (Figure 5.2; Sections 5.4 and 5.6) (Raupach et al., 2014; Schwinger et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2019). There is  high  confidence that carbon–climate feedbacks and their century scale evolution play a critical role in two linked climate metrics that have significant climate and policy implications: (i) the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that remains in the atmosphere, the so-called airborne fraction of CO2 (AF; Section 5.2.1.2, Figures 5.2 and 5.7, and FAQ 5.1); and (ii) the quasi-linear trend characteristic of the transient temperature response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE; Section 5.5; MacDougall, 2016; Williams et al., 2016; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) and other GHGs (CH4 and N2O). This chapter assesses the implications of these issues from the perspective of carbon cycle processes (Figure 5.2) in Section 5.2 (historical and contemporary), Section 5.3 (changing carbonate chemistry), Section 5.4 (future projections), Section 5.5 (remaining carbon budget) and Section 5.6 (response to carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation modification)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The airborne fraction is an important constraint for adjustments in carbon–climate feedbacks and reflects the partitioning of CO2 emissions between reservoirs by the negative feedbacks, which were 31% on land and 23% in the ocean for the decade 2010–2019 and also dominated the historical period (Figure 5.2; Table 5.1) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). During the period 1959–2019, the airborne fraction has largely followed the growth in anthropogenic CO2 emissions with a mean of 44% and a large interannual variability (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Ciais et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020, Section 5.2.1.2; Table 5.1). The negative feedback to CO2 concentrations is associated with its impact on the air–sea and air–land CO2 exchange through strengthening of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) gradients as well as the internal processes that enhance uptake. Two of these key processes are the buffering capacity of the ocean and the CO2 fertilization effect on gross primary production (Sections 5.4.1–5.4.4)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Positive and negative climate and carbon feedbacks involve: (i) fast processes on land and oceans at time scales from minutes to years, such as photosynthesis, soil respiration, net primary production, shallow ocean physics and air–sea fluxes; and (ii) slower processes taking from decades to millennia, such as changing ocean buffering capacity, ocean ventilation, vegetation dynamics, permafrost changes, peat formation and decomposition (Figure 5.2; Ciais et al., 2013; Forzieri et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2019). Depending on the particular combination of driver process and response dynamics, they behave as positive or negative feedbacks that amplify or dampen the magnitude and rates of climate change, respectively (Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2003, 2006; Hauck and Völker, 2015; Williams et al., 2019); red and turquoise arrows in Figure 5.2 and Table 5.1)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Carbon cycle feedbacks co-exist with climate (heat and moisture) feedbacks (Cross-Chapter Boxes 5.1 and 5.3), which together drive contemporary (Section 5.2) and future (Section 5.4) carbon–climate feedbacks (Williams et al., 2019). The excess heat generated by radiative forcing from increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs is mostly taken up by the ocean (>90%) and the residual balance partitioned between atmospheric, terrestrial and ice melting (Cross-Chapter Box 9.2; Frölicher et al., 2015). The combined effect of these two large-scale negative feedbacks of CO2 and heat are reflected in the TCRE (Section 5.5 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3), which points to a quasi-linear and quasi-emission-path independent relationship between cumulative emissions of CO2 and global warming, which is used as the basis to estimate the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall, 2017; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). There is still low confidence on the relative roles and importance of the ocean and terrestrial carbon processes on TCRE variability and uncertainty on centennial time scales (MacDougall, 2016; MacDougall et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017; Katavouta et al., 2018, 2019; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) (Sections 5.5.1.1, 5.5.1.2)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The combined effects of climate and CO2 concentration feedbacks on the global carbon cycle are projected by ESMs to modify both the processes and natural reservoirs of carbon on a regional and global scale that may result in positive feedbacks (red arrows in Figure 5.2), which could weaken the major terrestrial and ocean sinks and disrupt the airborne fraction and TCRE under medium- to high-emissions scenarios (Section 5.4.5 and Figure 5.25)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2_p1,5.1.2.1 Cenozoic Proxy CO,"Paleoclimatic proxy records extend beyond the variability of recent decadal climate oscillations and thus provide an independent perspective on feedbacks between climate and carbon cycle dynamics. According to reconstructions, these past changes were slower than the current anthropogenic ones, so they cannot provide an unequivocal comparison. Nonetheless, they can help appraise sensitivities and point towards potentially dominant mechanisms of change (Tierney et al., 2020) on (sub)centennial to (multi)millennial time scales."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2_p2,5.1.2.1 Cenozoic Proxy CO,"The AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5) concluded with medium  confidence that atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 350–450 ppm during the mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 million years ago (Ma)), and possibly 1000 ppm during the Early Eocene (52–48 Ma). The AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5) also concluded with very high confidence that the current rates of increases in CO2, CH4 and N2O atmospheric concentrations were unprecedented with respect to the ice core record covering the last deglacial transition (LDT, 18–11 ka) and with medium confidence that the rate of change of the reconstructed GHG rise was also unprecedented compared to the lower resolution of the records of the past 800 kyr."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Quantifying past changes in the rate of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere based on reconstructions using marine sediment proxies is complex as age model uncertainties, assumptions and shortcomings underlying proxy applications and sedimentary processes conspire to alter and confound rate estimates (Ajayi et al., 2020). Differential sediment mixing and bioturbation contribute to smooth and attenuate proxy records (Hupp and Kelly, 2020), thereby tending to underestimate maximum rates of change (Kemp et al., 2015). Considering the extent to which uncertainties can affect sediment-based rate estimates, and notwithstanding recent effort in minimizing their inherent contribution, there is generallylow to medium confidence in quantifying rates of change on a time scale less than a decade back thousands of years, and less than a millennium back millions of years in the past based on marine sediments."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"In the past, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached much higher levels than present day (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 and Figure 5.3). In particular, the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), 55.9–55.7 Ma (Figure 5.3), provides some level of comparison with the current and projected anthropogenic increase in CO2 emissions (Chapter 2). Atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased from about 900 to around 2000 ppm in 3–20 kyr as a result of geological carbon release to the ocean–atmosphere system (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Cui and Schubert, 2018; Kirtland Turner, 2018). There is low to medium confidence in evaluations of the total amount of carbon released during the PETM, as proxy data constrained estimates vary from around 3000 to more than 7000 PgC, with methane hydrates, volcanic emissions, terrestrial and/or marine organic carbon, or some combination thereof, as the probable sources of carbon (Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Elling et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2019; Haynes and Hönisch, 2020). Methane emissions related to hydrate/permafrost thawing and fossil carbon oxidation may have acted as positive feedbacks (Lunt et al., 2011; Armstrong McKay and Lenton, 2018; Lyons et al., 2019), as the inferred increase in atmospheric CO2 can only account for approximately half of the reported warming (Zeebe et al., 2009). The estimated, time-integrated carbon input is broadly similar to the RCP8.5 extension scenario, although CO2 emissions rates (0.3–1.5 Pg yr–1) and by inference the rate of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere (4–42 ppm per century) during the PETM were at least 4–5 lower than during the modern era (from 1995 to 2014; Table 2.1; Zeebe et al., 2016; Gingerich, 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The last 50 Myr (50 million years) have been characterized by a gradual decline in atmospheric CO2 levels at a rate of about 16 ppm Myr–1 (Figure 5.3; Foster et al., 2017; Gutjahr et al., 2017). The exact cause of this long-term change in CO2 remains uncertain, but may be related to an imbalance between long-term sources of CO2 (volcanic outgassing) and long-term sinks (organic carbon burial and silicate weathering)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The most recent time interval when atmospheric CO2 concentration was as high as 1000 ppm (i.e., similar to the end of 21st century projection for the high-end emissions scenario RCP8.5) was around 33.5 Ma, prior to the Eocene-Oligocene transition (Zhang et al., 2013; Anagnostou et al., 2016). Atmospheric CO2 levels then reached a critical threshold (1000–750 ppm; DeConto et al., 2008) to allow for the development of permanent regional ice sheets on Antarctica, associated with changes in Southern Ocean hydrography, which would have increased deep ocean CO2 storage (Leutert et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The most recent interval characterized by atmospheric CO2 levels similar to modern (i.e., 360–420 ppm) was the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP, 3.3–3.0 Ma; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015; de la Vega et al., 2020) (Chapter 2). The relatively high atmospheric CO2 concentration during the MPWP are related to vigorous ocean circulation and a rather inefficient marine biological carbon pump (Burls et al., 2017), which would have reduced deep ocean carbon storage. After the MPWP, atmospheric CO2 concentrations declined gradually at a rate of 30 ppm Myr–1 (Figure 5.3; de la Vega et al., 2020), as an increase in ocean stratification led to enhanced ocean carbon storage, allowing for major, sustained advances in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, 2.7 Ma (Sigman et al., 2004; DeConto et al., 2008)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Antarctic ice core record covering the past 800 kyr provides an important archive to explore the carbon–climate feedbacks prior to anthropogenic perturbations (Brovkin et al., 2016). Polar ice cores represent the only climatic archive from which past GHG concentrations can be directly measured. Major GHGs, CH4, N2O and CO2 generally co-vary on orbital time scales (Loulergue et al., 2008; Lüthi et al., 2008; Schilt et al., 2010b; Chapter 2), with consistently higher atmospheric concentrations during warm intervals of the past, pointing to a strong sensitivity to climate (Figure 5.4). Modelling work suggests that the carbon cycle contributed to globalise and amplify changes in orbital forcing, which are pacing glacial–interglacial climate oscillations (Ganopolski and Brovkin, 2017), with ocean biogeochemistry and physics, terrestrial vegetation, peatland, permafrost and exchanges with the lithosphere including chemical weathering, volcanic activity, sediment burial and marine calcium carbonate compensation all playing a role in modulating the concentration of atmospheric GHGs."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, the number of ice core records and the temporal resolution of their data for the last 800 kyr have improved, in particular for the last 60 kyr. Additionally, the advent of isotopic measurements on GHGs extracted from air trapped in ice, allows for more robust source apportionments and inventory assessments. Therefore, the ensuing discussion focuses on these two specific aspects."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Major pre-industrial sources of CH4 comprise wetlands (including subglacial environments) and biomass burning (Bock et al., 2010, 2017; Lamarche-Gagnon et al., 2019; Kleinen et al., 2020). Pre-industrial atmospheric N2O concentrations were regulated by microbial production in marine and terrestrial environments and by photochemical removal in the stratosphere (Schilt et al., 2014; Battaglia and Joos, 2018b; H. Fischer et al., 2019). Pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentrations were largely regulated by exchange with exogenic terrestrial and ocean carbon reservoirs. The imbalance between geological sources and sinks in the ocean–atmosphere–land biosphere system additionally plays an important role in modulating the air–sea partitioning of the active carbon inventory on multi-millennial time scales (Cartapanis et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Model-based estimates indicate that wetland CH4 emissions were reduced by 24–40% during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when compared to pre-industrial, while CH4 emissions related to biomass burning (wildfires) decreased by 35–75% (Valdes et al., 2005; Hopcroft et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). N2O emissions decreased by about 30% during the LGM based on data-constrained model estimates (Schilt et al., 2014; H. Fischer et al., 2019) owing to a combination of a weaker hydrological cycle and a generally better ventilated intermediate depth ocean relative to present, reducing (de)nitrification processes (Galbraith et al., 2013; Fischer et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"During past ice ages, generally colder and drier climate conditions contributed to a substantial decline of the land biosphere carbon inventory, in particular in boreal peatlands (–300 PgC; Treat et al., 2019). Estimates assessing the glacial decrease in the global terrestrial biosphere carbon stock vary between –300 and –600 PgC (Ciais et al., 2012; Peterson et al., 2014; Menviel et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020), possibly –850 PgC when accounting for ocean-sediment interactions and burial (Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019), a considerable contraction when compared to the modern land biosphere stock. The large range of estimates reflects a yet limited understanding of how carbon cycle dynamics were altered by glacially perturbed nutrient fluxes and soil dynamics, as well as largely exposed shelf areas in the tropics as a result of lowered sea level. Recent estimates suggest deep-sea CO2 storage during the last ice age exceeded modern values by as much as 750 – 950 PgC (Skinner et al., 2015, 2017; Buchanan et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019; Gottschalk et al., 2020b). A combination of increased CO2 solubility associated with 2–3°C lower mean oceanic temperatures (Bereiter et al., 2018), increased the oceanic residence time of CO2 (Skinner et al., 2017), altered oceanic alkalinity (Yu et al., 2010; Cartapanis et al., 2018). A generally more efficient marine biological carbon pump (BCP; Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020) enhanced the partition CO2 into the ocean interior, (although the relative contribution of each mechanism remains a matter of debate). Recent observationally constrained ESM results highlight that air–sea disequilibrium amplifies the effect of cooling and iron fertilization on glacial carbon storage (Khatiwala et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Ice core observations combined with model-based estimates thus reveal with  high confidence that both terrestrial and marine CH4 and N2O emissions were reduced under glacial climate conditions. Multiple lines of evidence indicate with  high confidence that enhanced storage of remineralized CO2 in the ocean interior, owing to a combination of synergistic mechanisms, was sufficient to balance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined during the last ice age."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Vegetation regrowth and increased precipitation in wetland regions associated with the mid-deglacial Northern Hemisphere warming (referred to as the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) warm interval, 14.7–12.7 ka), in particular in the (sub)tropics, accounts for large increases in both CH4 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere (Baumgartner et al., 2014; Schilt et al., 2014; Bock et al., 2017; H. Fischer et al., 2019). Specifically, changes in CH4 sources were steered by variations in vegetation productivity, source size area, temperatures and precipitation as modulated by insolation, local sea level changes and monsoon intensity (Bock et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). Changes in the CH4 atmospheric sink term probably only played a secondary role in modulating atmospheric CH4 inventories across the LDT (Hopcroft et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020) Geological emissions, related to the destabilization of fossil (radiocarbon-dead) CH4 sources buried in continental margins as a result of sudden warming, appear small (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). Stable isotope analysis on N2O extracted from Antarctic and Greenland ice reveal that marine and terrestrial emissions increased by 0.7 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.3 TgN, respectively, across the LDT (Fischer et al., 2019). During abrupt Northern Hemisphere warmings, terrestrial emissions responded rapidly to the northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated with the resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; H. Fischer et al., 2019). About 90% of these step increases occurred rapidly, possibly in less than 200 years (Fischer et al., 2019). In contrast, marine emissions increased more gradually, modulated by global ocean circulation reorganization."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"The gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 across the LDT was punctuated by three centennial 10–13 ppm increments, coeval with 100–200 ppb increases in CH4 (Marcott et al., 2014), reminiscent of similar oscillations reported for the last ice age associated with transient warming events (Dansgaard/Oeschger (DO) events; Ahn and Brook, 2014; Rhodes et al., 2017; Bauska et al., 2018) as well as previous deglacial transitions (Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2020). The rate of change in atmospheric CO2 accumulation during these transient events exceeds the averaged deglacial growth rates by at least 50% (Table 2.1, Figure 5.4). The early deglacial release of remineralized carbon from the ocean abyss coincided with the resumption of Southern Ocean overturning circulation (Skinner et al.,2010; Schmitt et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2014; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020a; Jaccard et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018; Moy et al., 2019) and the concomitant reduction in the global efficiency of the marine BCP, associated, in part, with dwindling iron fertilization (Hain et al., 2010; Martínez-García et al., 2014; Jaccard et al., 2016) The two subsequent pulses, centred 14.8 and 12.9 ka, are associated with enhanced air–sea gas exchange in the Southern Ocean (T. Li et al., 2020), iron fertilization in the South Atlantic and North Pacific (Lambert et al., 2021) and rapid increase in soil respiration owing to the resumption of AMOC and associated southward migration of the ITCZ (Marcottet al., 2014; Bauska et al., 2018). Rapid warming of high northern latitudes contributed to thaw permafrost, possibly liberating labile organic carbon to the atmosphere (Köhler et al.,2014; Crichton et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019). Ocean surface pH reconstructions indicate that the ocean was oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere during the early, mid-LDT (Martínez-Botí et al., 2015b; Shao et al., 2019; Shuttleworth et al., 2021), suggesting that ocean sources at that time may have been larger than terrestrial sources. Over the course of the LDT, the decrease in Northern Hemisphere permafrost carbon stocks has been more than compensated by an increase in the carbon stocks of mineral soils, peatland and vegetation (Lindgren et al., 2018; Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019). The land biosphere was, on average, a net sink for atmospheric carbon and accumulated several hundred Gt of carbon over the LDT. Detailed investigations reveal that Antarctic air temperatures, and more generally Southern Hemisphere (30°S–60°S) proxy temperature reconstructions, led the rise inpCO2 at the onset of the LDT, 18 ka ago, by several hundred years (Shakun et al., 2012; Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Atmospheric CO2 led reconstructed global average temperature by several centuries (Shakun et al., 2012), corroborating the importance of CO2 as an amplifier of orbitally driven warming. During the LDT, the phasing between Antarctic air temperature and atmospheric GHG concentration changes was nearly synchronous, yet variable, owing to the complex nature of the mechanisms modulating the global carbon cycle (Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Mean ocean temperature reconstructions, based on noble gas extracted from Antarctic ice are closely correlated with Antarctic air temperature and pCO2 records, emphasizing the role the Southern Ocean is playing in modulating global climate variability (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Enhanced mid-ocean ridge magmatism and/or hydrothermal activity modulated by sea level rise has recently been hypothesized to have contributed to the deglacial CO2 rise (Crowley et al., 2015; Lund et al., 2016; Huybers and Langmuir, 2017; Stott et al., 2019b). While geological carbon release may have affected the ocean’s radiocarbon budget (Ronge et al., 2016; Rafter et al., 2019; Stott et al., 2019a), model results suggest that the potential contribution of geological carbon sources to the atmosphere remained small (Roth and Joos, 2012; Hasenclever et al., 2017)."

The most important processes accounting for the full deglacial CO2 amplitude in the models include solubility changes, changes in oceanic circulation and marine carbonate chemistry. The effect of the terrestrial carbon cycle, variable volcanic outgassing and the temperature dependence on the oceanic remineralization length scale contribute less than 15 ppm CO2 between the glacial and interglacial intervals of the cycles.

Atmospheric N2O concentrations increased slightly (20 ppb) across the Holocene, associated with a gradual decline in its nitrogen stable isotope composition (H. Fischer et al., 2019).

Considering the extent to which uncertainties can affect sediment-based rate estimates, and notwithstanding recent effort in minimizing their inherent contribution, there is generallylow to medium confidence in quantifying rates of change on a time scale less than a decade back thousands of years, and less than a millennium back millions of years in the past based on marine sediments."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"In the past, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached much higher levels than present day (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 and Figure 5.3). In particular, the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), 55.9–55.7 Ma (Figure 5.3), provides some level of comparison with the current and projected anthropogenic increase in CO2 emissions (Chapter 2). Atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased from about 900 to around 2000 ppm in 3–20 kyr as a result of geological carbon release to the ocean–atmosphere system (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Cui and Schubert, 2018; Kirtland Turner, 2018). There is low to medium confidence in evaluations of the total amount of carbon released during the PETM, as proxy data constrained estimates vary from around 3000 to more than 7000 PgC, with methane hydrates, volcanic emissions, terrestrial and/or marine organic carbon, or some combination thereof, as the probable sources of carbon (Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Elling et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2019; Haynes and Hönisch, 2020). Methane emissions related to hydrate/permafrost thawing and fossil carbon oxidation may have acted as positive feedbacks (Lunt et al., 2011; Armstrong McKay and Lenton, 2018; Lyons et al., 2019), as the inferred increase in atmospheric CO2 can only account for approximately half of the reported warming (Zeebe et al., 2009). The estimated, time-integrated carbon input is broadly similar to the RCP8.5 extension scenario, although CO2 emissions rates (0.3–1.5 Pg yr–1) and by inference the rate of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere (4–42 ppm per century) during the PETM were at least 4–5 lower than during the modern era (from 1995 to 2014; Table 2.1; Zeebe et al., 2016; Gingerich, 2019)."

The exact cause of this long-term change in CO2 remains uncertain, but may be related to an imbalance between long-term sources of CO2 (volcanic outgassing) and long-term sinks (organic carbon burial and silicate weathering)."

Atmospheric CO2 levels then reached a critical threshold (1000–750 ppm; DeConto et al., 2008) to allow for the development of permanent regional ice sheets on Antarctica, associated with changes in Southern Ocean hydrography, which would have increased deep ocean CO2 storage (Leutert et al., 2020)."

The relatively high atmospheric CO2 concentration during the MPWP are related to vigorous ocean circulation and a rather inefficient marine biological carbon pump (Burls et al., 2017), which would have reduced deep ocean carbon storage. After the MPWP, atmospheric CO2 concentrations declined gradually at a rate of 30 ppm Myr–1 (Figure 5.3; de la Vega et al., 2020), as an increase in ocean stratification led to enhanced ocean carbon storage, allowing for major, sustained advances in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, 2.7 Ma (Sigman et al., 2004; DeConto et al., 2008)."

Major GHGs, CH4, N2O and CO2 generally co-vary on orbital time scales (Loulergue et al., 2008; Lüthi et al., 2008; Schilt et al., 2010b; Chapter 2), with consistently higher atmospheric concentrations during warm intervals of the past, pointing to a strong sensitivity to climate (Figure 5.4). Modelling work suggests that the carbon cycle contributed to globalise and amplify changes in orbital forcing, which are pacing glacial–interglacial climate oscillations (Ganopolski and Brovkin, 2017), with ocean biogeochemistry and physics, terrestrial vegetation, peatland, permafrost and exchanges with the lithosphere including chemical weathering, volcanic activity, sediment burial and marine calcium carbonate compensation all playing a role in modulating the concentration of atmospheric GHGs."

Therefore, the ensuing discussion focuses on these two specific aspects."

Fischer et al., 2019). Pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentrations were largely regulated by exchange with exogenic terrestrial and ocean carbon reservoirs. The imbalance between geological sources and sinks in the ocean–atmosphere–land biosphere system additionally plays an important role in modulating the air–sea partitioning of the active carbon inventory on multi-millennial time scales (Cartapanis et al., 2018)."

N2O emissions decreased by about 30% during the LGM based on data-constrained model estimates (Schilt et al., 2014; H.

wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"During past ice ages, generally colder and drier climate conditions contributed to a substantial decline of the land biosphere carbon inventory, in particular in boreal peatlands (–300 PgC; Treat et al., 2019). Estimates assessing the glacial decrease in the global terrestrial biosphere carbon stock vary between –300 and –600 PgC (Ciais et al., 2012; Peterson et al., 2014; Menviel et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020), possibly –850 PgC when accounting for ocean-sediment interactions and burial (Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019), a considerable contraction when compared to the modern land biosphere stock. The large range of estimates reflects a yet limited understanding of how carbon cycle dynamics were altered by glacially perturbed nutrient fluxes and soil dynamics, as well as largely exposed shelf areas in the tropics as a result of lowered sea level. Recent estimates suggest deep-sea CO2 storage during the last ice age exceeded modern values by as much as 750 – 950 PgC (Skinner et al., 2015, 2017; Buchanan et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019; Gottschalk et al., 2020b). A combination of increased CO2 solubility associated with 2–3°C lower mean oceanic temperatures (Bereiter et al., 2018), increased the oceanic residence time of CO2 (Skinner et al., 2017), altered oceanic alkalinity (Yu et al., 2010; Cartapanis et al., 2018). A generally more efficient marine biological carbon pump (BCP; Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020) enhanced the partition CO2 into the ocean interior, (although the relative contribution of each mechanism remains a matter of debate). Recent observationally constrained ESM results highlight that air–sea disequilibrium amplifies the effect of cooling and iron fertilization on glacial carbon storage (Khatiwala et al., 2019)."

Fischer et al., 2019). Specifically, changes in CH4 sources were steered by variations in vegetation productivity, source size area, temperatures and precipitation as modulated by insolation, local sea level changes and monsoon intensity (Bock et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). Changes in the CH4 atmospheric sink term probably only played a secondary role in modulating atmospheric CH4 inventories across the LDT (Hopcroft et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020) Geological emissions, related to the destabilization of fossil (radiocarbon-dead) CH4 sources buried in continental margins as a result of sudden warming, appear small (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). Stable isotope analysis on N2O extracted from Antarctic and Greenland ice reveal that marine and terrestrial emissions increased by 0.7 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.3 TgN, respectively, across the LDT (Fischer et al., 2019). During abrupt Northern Hemisphere warmings, terrestrial emissions responded rapidly to the northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated with the resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; H. Fischer et al., 2019). About 90% of these step increases occurred rapidly, possibly in less than 200 years (Fischer et al., 2019). In contrast, marine emissions increased more gradually, modulated by global ocean circulation reorganization."
wg1_ch05_5.1.2.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"The gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 across the LDT was punctuated by three centennial 10–13 ppm increments, coeval with 100–200 ppb increases in CH4 (Marcott et al., 2014), reminiscent of similar oscillations reported for the last ice age associated with transient warming events (Dansgaard/Oeschger (DO) events; Ahn and Brook, 2014; Rhodes et al., 2017; Bauska et al., 2018) as well as previous deglacial transitions (Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2020). The rate of change in atmospheric CO2 accumulation during these transient events exceeds the averaged deglacial growth rates by at least 50% (Table 2.1, Figure 5.4). The early deglacial release of remineralized carbon from the ocean abyss coincided with the resumption of Southern Ocean overturning circulation (Skinner et al.,2010; Schmitt et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2014; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020a; Jaccard et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018; Moy et al., 2019) and the concomitant reduction in the global efficiency of the marine BCP, associated, in part, with dwindling iron fertilization (Hain et al., 2010; Martínez-García et al., 2014; Jaccard et al., 2016) The two subsequent pulses, centred 14.8 and 12.9 ka, are associated with enhanced air–sea gas exchange in the Southern Ocean (T. Li et al., 2020), iron fertilization in the South Atlantic and North Pacific (Lambert et al., 2021) and rapid increase in soil respiration owing to the resumption of AMOC and associated southward migration of the ITCZ (Marcottet al., 2014; Bauska et al., 2018). Rapid warming of high northern latitudes contributed to thaw permafrost, possibly liberating labile organic carbon to the atmosphere (Köhler et al.,2014; Crichton et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019). Ocean surface pH reconstructions indicate that the ocean was oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere during the early, mid-LDT (Martínez-Botí et al., 2015b; Shao et al., 2019; Shuttleworth et al., 2021), suggesting that ocean sources at that time may have been larger than terrestrial sources. Over the course of the LDT, the decrease in Northern Hemisphere permafrost carbon stocks has been more than compensated by an increase in the carbon stocks of mineral soils, peatland and vegetation (Lindgren et al., 2018; Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019). The land biosphere was, on average, a net sink for atmospheric carbon and accumulated several hundred Gt of carbon over the LDT. Detailed investigations reveal that Antarctic air temperatures, and more generally Southern Hemisphere (30°S–60°S) proxy temperature reconstructions, led the rise inpCO2 at the onset of the LDT, 18 ka ago, by several hundred years (Shakun et al., 2012; Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Atmospheric CO2 led reconstructed global average temperature by several centuries (Shakun et al., 2012), corroborating the importance of CO2 as an amplifier of orbitally driven warming. During the LDT, the phasing between Antarctic air temperature and atmospheric GHG concentration changes was nearly synchronous, yet variable, owing to the complex nature of the mechanisms modulating the global carbon cycle (Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Mean ocean temperature reconstructions, based on noble gas extracted from Antarctic ice are closely correlated with Antarctic air temperature and pCO2 records, emphasizing the role the Southern Ocean is playing in modulating global climate variability (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019)."

While geological carbon release may have affected the ocean’s radiocarbon budget (Ronge et al., 2016; Rafter et al., 2019; Stott et al., 2019a), model results suggest that the potential contribution of geological carbon sources to the atmosphere remained small (Roth and Joos, 2012; Hasenclever et al., 2017)."

The most important processes accounting for the full deglacial CO2 amplitude in the models include solubility changes, changes in oceanic circulation and marine carbonate chemistry. The effect of the terrestrial carbon cycle, variable volcanic outgassing and the temperature dependence on the oceanic remineralization length scale contribute less than 15 ppm CO2 between the glacial and interglacial intervals of the cycles.

Fossil CO2 emissions include the combustion of the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas, covering all sectors of the economy (electricity, transport, industrial, and buildings), fossil carbonates such as in cement manufacturing, and other industrial processes such as the production of chemicals and fertilizers (Figure 5.5a). Fossil CO2 emissions are estimated by combining economic activity data and emissions factors, with different levels of methodological complexity (tiers) or approaches (e.g., IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories). Several organizations or groups provide estimates of fossil CO2 emissions, with each dataset having slightly different system boundaries, methods, activity data, and emissions factors (Andrew, 2020). Datasets cover different time periods, which can dictate the datasets and methods that are used for a particular application. The data reported here is from an annually updated data source that combines multiple sources to maximise temporal coverage (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).

In 2019, fossil CO2 emissions were estimated to be 9.9 ±0.5 PgC yr–1excluding carbonation (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), the highest on record. These estimates exclude the cement carbonation sink of around 0.2 PgC yr–1. Fossil CO2 emissions grew at 0.9% yr–1 in the 1990s, increasing to 3.0% yr–1 in the 2000s, and reduced to 1.2% from 2010 to 2019. The slower growth in fossil CO2 emissions in the last decade is due to a slowdown in growth from coal use. CO2 emissions from coal use grew at 4.8% yr–1 in the 2000s, but slowed to 0.4% yr–1 in the 2010s. CO2 emissions from oil use grew steadily at 1.1% yr–1 in both the 2000s and 2010s. CO2 emissions from gas use grew at 2.5% yr–1 in the 2000s and 2.4% yr–1 in 2010s, but has shown signs of accelerated growth of 3% yr–1 since 2015 (Peters et al., 2020).

It consists of gross emissions (loss of biomass and soil carbon in clearing or logging, harvested product decay, emissions from peat drainage and burning, degradation) and gross removals (CO2 uptake in natural vegetation regrowing after harvesting or agricultural abandonment, afforestation). The LULUCF flux relates to direct human interference with terrestrial vegetation, as opposed to the natural carbon fluxes occurring due to interannual variability or trends in environmental conditions (in particular, climate, CO2, and nutrient deposition) (Houghton, 2013)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Progress since AR5 and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a) allows more accurate estimates of gross and net fluxes due to the availability of more models, model advancement in terms of inclusiveness of land-use practices, and advanced land-use forcings (Ciais et al., 2013; Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017; Hurtt et al., 2020). In addition, important terminological discrepancies were resolved. First, synergistic effects of land-use change and environmental changes have been identified as a key reason for the large discrepancies between model estimates of the LULUCF flux, explaining up to 50% of differences (Pongratz et al., 2014; Stocker and Joos, 2015; Gasser et al., 2020). Another reason for discrepancies relates to natural fluxes being considered as part of the LULUCF flux when occurring on managed land in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) national GHG inventories; these fluxes are considered part of the natural terrestrial sink in global vegetation models and excluded in bookkeeping models (Grassi et al., 2018). LULUCF fluxes following national GHG inventories or Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) datasets, including recent estimates (Tubiello et al., 2021), are thus excluded from our global assessment, but their comparison against the academic approach is available elsewhere – at the global scale (Jia et al., 2019) and European level (Petrescu et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Land-use-related component fluxes can be verified by the growing databases of global satellite-based biomass observations in combination with information on remotely sensed land cover change. However, they differ from bookkeeping and modelling with Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) in excluding legacy emissions from pre-satellite-era land-use change and land management, and neglecting soil carbon changes, often focusing on gross deforestation, not regrowth (Jia et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"For the decade 2010–2019, average emissions were estimated at 1.6 ± 0.7 PgC yr–1 (mean ± standard deviation, 1 sigma; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Alikely general upward trend since 1850 is reversed during the second part of the 20th century (Figure 5.5b). Trends since the 1980s have low confidence because they differ between estimates, which is related, among other things, to Houghton and Nassikas (2017) using a different land-use forcing than Hansis et al. (2015) and the DGVMs. Higher emissions estimates are expected from DGVMs run under transient environmental conditions compared to bookkeeping estimates, because the DGVM estimate includes the loss of additional sink capacity. Because the transient setup requires a reference simulation without land-use change to separate anthropogenic fluxes from natural land fluxes, LULUCF estimates by DGVMs include the sink forests that would have developed in response to environmental changes on areas that in reality have been cleared (Pongratz et al., 2014). The agricultural areas that replaced these forests have a reduced residence time of carbon, lacking woody material, and thus provide a substantially smaller additional sink over time (Gitz and Ciais, 2003). The loss of additional sink capacity is growing in particular with atmospheric CO2 and increases DGVM-based LULUCF flux estimates relative to bookkeeping estimates over time (Figure 5.5)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Gross emissions are on average two to three times larger than the net flux from LULUCF, increasing from an average of 3.5 ± 1.2 PgC yr–1 for the decade of the 1960s to an average of 4.4 ± 1.6 PgC yr–1 during 2010–2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Gross removals partly balance these gross emissions to yield the net flux from LULUCF and increase from –2.0 ± 0.7 PgC yr–1 for the 1960s to –2.9 ± 1.2 PgC yr–1 during 2010–2019. These large gross fluxes show the relevance of land management, such as harvesting or rotational agriculture, and the large potential to reduce emissions by halting deforestation and degradation."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"More evidence on the pre-industrial LULUCF flux has emerged since AR5 in the form of new estimates of cumulative carbon losses until today, and of a better understanding of natural carbon cycle processes over the Holocene (Ciais et al., 2013). Cumulative carbon losses by land-use activities since the start of agriculture and forestry (pre-industrial and industrial era) have been estimated at 116 PgC based on global compilations of carbon stocks for soils (Sanderman et al., 2017) with about 70 PgC of this occurring prior to 1750, and for vegetation as 447 PgC (inner quartiles of 42 calculations: 375–525 PgC) (Erb et al., 2018). Emissions prior to 1750 can be estimated by subtracting the post-1750 LULUCF flux from Table 5.1 from the combined soil and vegetation losses until today; they would then amount to 328 (161–501) PgC assuming error ranges are independent. A share of 353 (310–395) PgC from prior to 1800 has indirectly been suggested as the difference between net biosphere flux and terrestrial sink estimates, which is compatible with ice-core records due to a low airborne fraction of anthropogenic emissions in pre-industrial times (Erb et al., 2018; see also Section 5.1.2.3). Low confidence is assigned to pre-industrial emissions estimates."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, evidence emerged that the LULUCF flux might have been underestimated as DGVMs include anthropogenic land cover change, but often ignore land management practices not associated with a change in land cover; land management is more widely captured by bookkeeping models through use of observation-based carbon densities (Ciais et al., 2013; Pongratz et al., 2018). Sensitivity studies show that practices such as wood and crop harvesting increase global net LULUCF emissions (Arneth et al., 2017) and explain about half of the cumulative loss in biomass (Erb et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements in remote locations began in 1957 at the South Pole Observatory (SPO) and in 1958 at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), Hawaii, USA (Keeling, 1960) (Figure 5.6a). Since then, measurements have been extended to multiple locations around the world (Bacastow et al., 1980; Conway et al., 1994; Nakazawa et al., 1997). In addition, high-density global observations of total column CO2 measurements by dedicated GHG-observing satellites began in 2009 (Yoshida et al., 2013; O’Dell et al., 2018). Annual mean CO2 growth rates are observed to be 1.56 ± 0.18 ppm yr–1 (average and range from 1 standard deviation of annual values) over the 61 years of atmospheric measurements (1959–2019), with the rate of CO2 accumulation almost tripling from an average of 0.82 ± 0.29 ppm yr–1 during the decade of 1960–1969 to 2.39 ± 0.37 ppm yr–1 during the decade of 2010–2019 (Chapter 2). The latter agrees well with that derived for total column (XCO2) measurements by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT; Figure 5.6b). The interannual oscillations in monthly mean CO2 growth rates (Figure 5.6b) show a close relationship with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Figure 5.6b) due to the ENSO-driven changes in terrestrial and ocean CO2 sources and sinks on the Earth’s surface (Section 5.2.1.4)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Multiple lines of evidence unequivocally establish the dominant role of human activities in the growth of atmospheric CO2. First, the systematic increase in the difference between the MLO and SPO records (Figure 5.6a) is caused primarily by the increase in emissions from fossil fuel combustion in industrialized regions that are situated predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019). Second, measurements of the stable carbon isotope in the atmosphere (d13C–CO2) are more negative over time because CO2 from fossil fuels extracted from geological storage is depleted in13C (Figure 5.6c; Rubino et al., 2013; Keeling et al., 2017). Third, measurements of the d(O2/N2) ratio show a declining trend because for every molecule of carbon burned, 1.17 to 1.98 molecules of oxygen (O2) is consumed (Figure 5.6d; Ishidoya et al., 2012; Keeling and Manning, 2014). These three lines of evidence confirm unambiguously that the atmospheric increase of CO2 is due to an oxidative process (i.e., combustion). Fourth, measurements of radiocarbon (14C–CO2) at sites around the world (Levin et al., 2010; Graven et al., 2017; Turnbull et al., 2017) show a continued long-term decrease in the14C/12C ratio. Fossil fuels are devoid of14C and therefore fossil fuel-derived CO2 additions decrease the atmospheric14C/12C ratio (Suess, 1955)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Over the past six decades, the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that has accumulated in the atmosphere (referred to as airborne fraction) has remained near constant at approximately 44% (Figure 5.7) (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Ciais et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). This suggests that the land and ocean CO2 sinks have continued to grow at a rate consistent with the growth rate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, albeit with large interannual and sub-decadal variability dominated by the land sinks (Figure 5.7)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, an alternative observable diagnostic to the airborne fraction has been proposed to understand the trends in land and ocean sinks in response to its driving atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). It is the sink rate that is defined as the combined ocean and land sink flux per unit of atmospheric excess of CO2 above pre-industrial levels (Raupach et al., 2014). The sink rate has declined over the past six decades, which indicates that the combined ocean and land sinks are not growing as fast as the growth in atmospheric CO2 (Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). Possible explanations for the sink rate decline are that the land and/or ocean CO2 sinks are no longer responding linearly with CO2 concentrations or that anthropogenic emissions are slower than exponential (Figure 5.7 and Sections 5.2.1.3 and 5.2.1.4; Gloor et al., 2010; Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). In addition, both diagnostics are influenced by major climate modes (e.g., ENSO) and volcanic eruptions that contribute to high interannual variability (Gloor et al., 2010; Frölicher et al., 2013; Raupach et al., 2014), suggesting high sensitivity to future climate change. Uncertain land-use change fluxes (Section 5.2.1.2) influence the robustness of the trends. Based on the airborne fraction (AF), it is concluded with medium confidence that both ocean and land CO2 sinks have grown consistent with the rising of anthropogenic emissions. Further research is needed to understand the drivers of changes in the CO2 sink rate."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3_p1,5.2.1.3.1 Ocean carbon fluxes and storage: Global multi-decadal trends,"Since AR5 and SROCC, major advances in globally coordinated ocean CO2 observations (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT; and Global Ocean Data Analysis Project, GLODAP), the harmonization of ocean and coastal-observation-based products, atmospheric and oceanic inversion models and forced global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) have increased the level of confidence in the assessment of trends and variability of air–sea fluxes and storage of CO2 in the ocean during the historical period (1960–2018; see also Supplementary Materials 5.SM.1; Ciais et al., 2013; Bakker et al., 2016; Landschützer et al., 2016, 2020; Bindoff et al., 2019; DeVries et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019a, b; Tohjima et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020; Olsen et al., 2020). A major advance since SROCC is that, for the first time, all six published observational product fluxes used in this assessment, are made more comparable using a common ocean and sea ice cover area, integration of climatological coastal fluxes scaled to increasing atmospheric CO2 and an ensemble mean of ocean fluxes calculated from three re-analysis wind products (Supplementary Materials 5.SM.2; Landschützer et al., 2014, 2020; Rödenbeck et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014; Denvil-Sommer et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Iida et al., 2021). From a process point of view, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon is a two-step set of abiotic processes that involves the exchange of CO2, first across the air–sea boundary into the surface mixed layer, followed by its transport into the ocean interior where it is stored for decades to millennia, depending on the depth of storage (Gruber et al., 2019b). Two definitions of air–sea fluxes of CO2 are used in this assessment for both observational products and models: Socean is the global mean ocean CO2 sink and Fnet  denotes the net spatially varying CO2 fluxes (Hauck et al., 2020). Adjustment of the mean global Fnet  for the pre-industrial sea-to-air CO2 flux associated with land-to-ocean carbon flux term makes Fnet  comparable to Socean (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018; Hauck et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3_p2,5.2.1.3.1 Ocean carbon fluxes and storage: Global multi-decadal trends,"There are multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence that support with  high confidence the finding that, in the historical period (1960–2018), air–sea fluxes and storage of anthropogenic CO2 are largely influenced by atmospheric CO2 concentrations, physical ocean processes and physicochemical carbonate chemistry, which determines the unique properties of CO2 in seawater (Chapter 9 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Wanninkhof, 2014; DeVries et al., 2017; McKinley et al., 2017, 2020, Gruber et al., 2019a, b; Hauck et al., 2020). Here we assess three different approaches (Figures 5.8a,b and 5.9) that together provide  high  confidence that, during the historical period (1960–2018), the ocean carbon sink (Socean) and its associated ocean carbon storage have grown in response to global anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Gruber et al., 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020; McKinley et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In the first assessment approach, the mean global multi-decadal (1960–2019) trends in the ocean sink (Socean) for CO2 show a high degree of coherence across the nine GOBMs and sixpCO2 -based observational product reconstructions (1987–2018) which, despite a temporary slowdown (or ‘hiatus’) in the 1990s, is also quasi-linear over that period (Figure 5.8a; Gregor et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). This coherence between the GOBMs and observations-based reconstructions (1987–2018; r2=0.85) provides  high confidence that the ocean sink (Socean in Section 5.2.1.5) evaluated from GOBMs (1960–2019) grew quasi-linearly from 1.0 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1 to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr–1 between the decades 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO2 emissions (Figure 5.8a; Table 5.1; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020). The cumulative ocean CO2 uptake (105 ± 20 PgC) is 23% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions (450 ± 50 PgC) for the same period (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Notwithstanding the  high confidence in the magnitude of the annual to decadal trends for Socean,  this assessment is moderated to mediumconfidence by the low confidence in the currently inadequately constrained uncertainties in the pre-industrial land-to-ocean carbon flux, the uncertain magnitude of winter outgassing from the Southern Ocean, and the uncertain effect of the ocean surface cool-skin, the effect of data sparsity, differences between wind products and the uncertain contribution from the changing land–ocean continuum on global and regional fluxes (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2018; Bushinsky et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2020; Gloege et al., 2021). However, both GOBMs and pCO2 -based observational products independently reveal a slowdown or ‘hiatus’ of the ocean sink in the 1990s, which provides a valuable constraint for model verification and leads to greater confidence in the model outputs  (Figure 5.8a; Landschützer et al., 2016; Gregor et al., 2018; DeVries et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). A number of studies point to the role of the Southern Ocean in the global ‘1990s hiatus’ in air–sea CO2 fluxes, but provide different process-based explanations linking ocean temperature, mixing and meridional overturning circulation (MOC) responses to variability in large-scale climate systems, wind stress and volcanic activity, as well as the sensitivity of the air–sea CO2 flux to small changes in the atmospheric forcing from anthropogenic CO2 (Landschützer et al., 2016; DeVries et al., 2017; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2019a; Keppler and Landschützer, 2019; McKinley et al., 2020; Nevison et al., 2020). Data sparsity in the Southern Ocean could also be a factor amplifying the global decadal perturbation of the 1990s (Gloege et al., 2021). Therefore, while there is  high confidence in the 1990s hiatus of the global ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2,  and that the Southern Ocean makes an observable contribution to it, there is still low confidence in the attribution for the processes behind the 1990s hiatus (Section 5.2.1.3.2). Observed increases in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of oceanpCO2 and reductions in the mean global buffering capacity provide  high confidence that the growing CO2 sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry (Jiang et al., 2019). However, there is medium confidence that these changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of Socean (Sections 5.1.2; 5.3.2 and 5.4.2, and Figure 5.8a; SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.2; Bates et al., 2014; Sutton et al., 2016; Fassbender et al., 2017; Landschützer et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). A recent model-based study suggests that re-emergence of previously stored anthropogenic CO2 is changing the buffering capacity of the mixed layer and reducing the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 during the historical period (Rodgers et al., 2020). This trend is not reflected in observations-based products (Figure 5.8a), so we attribute a low confidence."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The second assessment approach makes use of six independent methods to constrain the mean decadal ocean sink over the period 1990–2019 (Figure 5.8b). This provides a multi-decadal advance on the 1990–1999 decadal constraint from (Denman et al., 2007) that has been widely used as a model constraint for GOBMs used for the global carbon budget (Hauck et al., 2020). The medium confidence attributed by this assessment of the global multi-decadal trend (Figure 5.8a) is further supported by the broad agreement in magnitude and trend of the decadal mean ocean CO2 uptake with assessments that also include additional observations-based, independent methods such as ocean CO2 inversion and atmospheric CO2 and O2/N2 measurements (Figure 5.8b; Supplementary Materials Tables 5.SM.1 and 5.SM.2)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Here we provide a third comparative assessment approach depicting the spatial coherence of ocean air–sea fluxes and storage rates of CO2 as well as a quantitative assessment of both fluxes for the same period (1994–2007; Figure 5.9). Observation-based pCO2 flux products show that emissions of natural CO2 occur mostly in the tropics and high-latitude Southern Ocean, and that the uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO2 occurs predominantly in the mid-latitudes (Chapter 9, Figure 5.9 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). Strong ocean CO2 sink regions are those in the mid-latitudes associated with the cooling of poleward flowing subtropical surface waters as well as equatorward flowing sub-polar surface waters, both of which contribute to the formation of Mode, Intermediate and Deep water masses that transport anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior on time scales of decades to centuries in both hemispheres (Section 9.2.2.3 and Figure 5.9; DeVries, 2014; Gruber et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019). The mean decadal scale magnitude and uncertainties of Socean from net air sea fluxes (Fnet ) were calculated from an ensemble of six observational-based product reconstructions (Figure 5.9a) and the storage rates in the ocean interior derived from multiple ocean interior CO2 datasets (Gruber et al., 2019b; Figure 5.9b). The cumulative CO2 stored in the ocean interior from 1800 to 2007 has been estimated at 140 ±18 PgC (Gruber et al., 2019b). As reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.1; IPCC, 2019b), the net ocean CO2 storage between 1994–2007 was 29 ± 4 PgC, which corresponds to a mean storage of 26 ± 5% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions for that period (Gruber et al., 2019b). The resulting net annual storage rate of anthropogenic CO2, equivalent to Socean for the period mid-1994 to mid-2007 is 2.2 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1, which is in very close agreement with the top-down air–sea flux estimate of Socean of 2.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr–1 from GOBMs and 1.9 ± 0.3PgC yr–1 frompCO2 -based observational products with the steady river carbon flux correction of 0.62 PgC yr–1 for the same time period (Gruber et al., 2019b; Hauck et al., 2020). This close agreement between these independent ocean CO2 sink estimates derived from air–sea fluxes and storage rates in the ocean interior support the medium confidence assessment that the ocean anthropogenic carbon storage rates continue to be determined by the ocean sink (Socean) in response to growing CO2 emissions (Figure 5.9; McKinley et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The intent of this assessment is to show how global variability can be regionally forced (Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). Since AR5 and SROCC, advances in global ocean CO2 flux products, GOBMs and atmospheric inversion models have strengthened confidence in the assessment of how ocean regions influence mean global variability and trends of ocean CO2 air–sea fluxes (Fnet ; see Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1; Ciais et al., 2013; Landschützer et al., 2014, 2015; Rödenbeck et al., 2014; McKinley et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020). The coherence in the regional variability of the anomalies in Fnet  from three independent lines of evidence support with  high confidence that the non-steady state global interannual-decadal variability of Fnet  has clear regional influences (Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019). The tropical oceans contribute the most to the global mean interannual variability (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d). The high latitude oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, contribute the most to the global-scale decadal variability (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM5.1b,c; (Landschützer et al., 2016, 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020). The influence of the Southern Ocean on the global mean decadal variability and the 1990s hiatus is supported by the highest regional–global correlation coefficients (Supplementary Materials Figures 5.SM.1a,c). In contrast, the equatorial oceans’ influence on global mean Fnet  has a low correlation because, notwithstanding the coherence in interannual variability, it does not show the same global mean trend of strengthening sink in response to growing global emissions (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d; Gregor et al., 2019). All regions, except the equatorial ocean, contribute to varying extents to the multi-decadal trend of growth in the global ocean sink (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1). Data sparseness in the high latitudes and the relatively short length of the observational records leads to low confidence in the attribution of the processes that link regional–global variability to climate (Landschützer et al., 2019; Gloege et al., 2021)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Regional decadal-scale anomalies in the variability of ocean CO2 storage have also emerged, probably associated with changes in the MOC, which may influence the global variability in Fnet  (Chapter 9; DeVries et al., 2017). In the interior of the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean, and the North Atlantic, the increase in the CO2 inventory from 1994 to 2007 was about 20% smaller than expected from the atmospheric CO2 increase during the same period and the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in 1994 (Sabine eta al., 2004; Gruber et al., 2019a). There is medium confidence that the ocean CO2 inventory strengthened again in the decade 2005–2015 (DeVries et al., 2017). In the North Atlantic, a low rate of anthropogenic CO2 storage at 1.9 ± 0.4 PgC per decade during the time period of 1989–2003 increased to 4.4 ± 0.9 PgC per decade during 2003–2014. This is associated with changing ventilation patterns driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (Woosley et al., 2016). In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, the rate of anthropogenic CO2 storage also increased from 8.8 ± 1.1 (1σ) PgC per decade during 1995–2005 to 11.7 ± 1.1 PgC per decade during 2005–2015 (Carter et al., 2019). However, in the Subantarctic Mode Water of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the storage rate of the anthropogenic CO2 was rather lower after 2005 than before (Section 9.2.3.2; Tanhua et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019). These changes have been predominantly ascribed to the impact of changes in the MOC on the transport of anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior due to regional climate variability, in addition to the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Section 9.2.3.1; Wanninkhof et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2013; DeVries et al., 2017, 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; McKinley et al., 2020). However,the low frequency of carbon observations in the interior of the vast ocean leads to medium confidence in the assessment of temporal variability in the rate of regional ocean CO2 storage and its controlling mechanisms."

The  high confidence assessment is moderated to medium confidence due to a number of ocean CO2 flux terms yet to be adequately constrained. Observed changes in the variability of oceanpCO2 and observed reductions in the mean global buffering capacity provide  high confidence that the growing CO2 sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry. However, there is medium confidence that these changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of Socean."

This coherence between the GOBMs and observations-based reconstructions (1987–2018; r2=0.85) provides  high confidence that the ocean sink (Socean in Section 5.2.1.5) evaluated from GOBMs (1960–2019) grew quasi-linearly from 1.0 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1 to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr–1 between the decades 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO2 emissions (Figure 5.8a; Table 5.1; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020). The cumulative ocean CO2 uptake (105 ± 20 PgC) is 23% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions (450 ± 50 PgC) for the same period (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Notwithstanding the  high confidence in the magnitude of the annual to decadal trends for Socean,  this assessment is moderated to mediumconfidence by the low confidence in the currently inadequately constrained uncertainties in the pre-industrial land-to-ocean carbon flux, the uncertain magnitude of winter outgassing from the Southern Ocean, and the uncertain effect of the ocean surface cool-skin, the effect of data sparsity, differences between wind products and the uncertain contribution from the changing land–ocean continuum on global and regional fluxes (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2018; Bushinsky et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2020; Gloege et al., 2021). However, both GOBMs and pCO2 -based observational products independently reveal a slowdown or ‘hiatus’ of the ocean sink in the 1990s, which provides a valuable constraint for model verification and leads to greater confidence in the model outputs  (Figure 5.8a; Landschützer et al., 2016; Gregor et al., 2018; DeVries et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). A number of studies point to the role of the Southern Ocean in the global ‘1990s hiatus’ in air–sea CO2 fluxes, but provide different process-based explanations linking ocean temperature, mixing and meridional overturning circulation (MOC) responses to variability in large-scale climate systems, wind stress and volcanic activity, as well as the sensitivity of the air–sea CO2 flux to small changes in the atmospheric forcing from anthropogenic CO2 (Landschützer et al., 2016; DeVries et al., 2017; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2019a; Keppler and Landschützer, 2019; McKinley et al., 2020; Nevison et al., 2020). Data sparsity in the Southern Ocean could also be a factor amplifying the global decadal perturbation of the 1990s (Gloege et al., 2021). Therefore, while there is  high confidence in the 1990s hiatus of the global ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2,  and that the Southern Ocean makes an observable contribution to it, there is still low confidence in the attribution for the processes behind the 1990s hiatus (Section 5.2.1.3.2). Observed increases in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of oceanpCO2 and reductions in the mean global buffering capacity provide  high confidence that the growing CO2 sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry (Jiang et al., 2019). However, there is medium confidence that these changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of Socean (Sections 5.1.2; 5.3.2 and 5.4.2, and Figure 5.8a; SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.2; Bates et al., 2014; Sutton et al., 2016; Fassbender et al., 2017; Landschützer et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). A recent model-based study suggests that re-emergence of previously stored anthropogenic CO2 is changing the buffering capacity of the mixed layer and reducing the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 during the historical period (Rodgers et al., 2020). This trend is not reflected in observations-based products (Figure 5.8a), so we attribute a low confidence."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The second assessment approach makes use of six independent methods to constrain the mean decadal ocean sink over the period 1990–2019 (Figure 5.8b). This provides a multi-decadal advance on the 1990–1999 decadal constraint from (Denman et al., 2007) that has been widely used as a model constraint for GOBMs used for the global carbon budget (Hauck et al., 2020). The medium confidence attributed by this assessment of the global multi-decadal trend (Figure 5.8a) is further supported by the broad agreement in magnitude and trend of the decadal mean ocean CO2 uptake with assessments that also include additional observations-based, independent methods such as ocean CO2 inversion and atmospheric CO2 and O2/N2 measurements (Figure 5.8b; Supplementary Materials Tables 5.SM.1 and 5.SM.2)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Here we provide a third comparative assessment approach depicting the spatial coherence of ocean air–sea fluxes and storage rates of CO2 as well as a quantitative assessment of both fluxes for the same period (1994–2007; Figure 5.9). Observation-based pCO2 flux products show that emissions of natural CO2 occur mostly in the tropics and high-latitude Southern Ocean, and that the uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO2 occurs predominantly in the mid-latitudes (Chapter 9, Figure 5.9 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). Strong ocean CO2 sink regions are those in the mid-latitudes associated with the cooling of poleward flowing subtropical surface waters as well as equatorward flowing sub-polar surface waters, both of which contribute to the formation of Mode, Intermediate and Deep water masses that transport anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior on time scales of decades to centuries in both hemispheres (Section 9.2.2.3 and Figure 5.9; DeVries, 2014; Gruber et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019). The mean decadal scale magnitude and uncertainties of Socean from net air sea fluxes (Fnet ) were calculated from an ensemble of six observational-based product reconstructions (Figure 5.9a) and the storage rates in the ocean interior derived from multiple ocean interior CO2 datasets (Gruber et al., 2019b; Figure 5.9b). The cumulative CO2 stored in the ocean interior from 1800 to 2007 has been estimated at 140 ±18 PgC (Gruber et al., 2019b). As reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.1; IPCC, 2019b), the net ocean CO2 storage between 1994–2007 was 29 ± 4 PgC, which corresponds to a mean storage of 26 ± 5% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions for that period (Gruber et al., 2019b). The resulting net annual storage rate of anthropogenic CO2, equivalent to Socean for the period mid-1994 to mid-2007 is 2.2 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1, which is in very close agreement with the top-down air–sea flux estimate of Socean of 2.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr–1 from GOBMs and 1.9 ± 0.3PgC yr–1 frompCO2 -based observational products with the steady river carbon flux correction of 0.62 PgC yr–1 for the same time period (Gruber et al., 2019b; Hauck et al., 2020). This close agreement between these independent ocean CO2 sink estimates derived from air–sea fluxes and storage rates in the ocean interior support the medium confidence assessment that the ocean anthropogenic carbon storage rates continue to be determined by the ocean sink (Socean) in response to growing CO2 emissions (Figure 5.9; McKinley et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The intent of this assessment is to show how global variability can be regionally forced (Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). Since AR5 and SROCC, advances in global ocean CO2 flux products, GOBMs and atmospheric inversion models have strengthened confidence in the assessment of how ocean regions influence mean global variability and trends of ocean CO2 air–sea fluxes (Fnet ; see Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1; Ciais et al., 2013; Landschützer et al., 2014, 2015; Rödenbeck et al., 2014; McKinley et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020). The coherence in the regional variability of the anomalies in Fnet  from three independent lines of evidence support with  high confidence that the non-steady state global interannual-decadal variability of Fnet  has clear regional influences (Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019). The tropical oceans contribute the most to the global mean interannual variability (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d). The high latitude oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, contribute the most to the global-scale decadal variability (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM5.1b,c; (Landschützer et al., 2016, 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020). The influence of the Southern Ocean on the global mean decadal variability and the 1990s hiatus is supported by the highest regional–global correlation coefficients (Supplementary Materials Figures 5.SM.1a,c). In contrast, the equatorial oceans’ influence on global mean Fnet  has a low correlation because, notwithstanding the coherence in interannual variability, it does not show the same global mean trend of strengthening sink in response to growing global emissions (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d; Gregor et al., 2019). All regions, except the equatorial ocean, contribute to varying extents to the multi-decadal trend of growth in the global ocean sink (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1). Data sparseness in the high latitudes and the relatively short length of the observational records leads to low confidence in the attribution of the processes that link regional–global variability to climate (Landschützer et al., 2019; Gloege et al., 2021)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Regional decadal-scale anomalies in the variability of ocean CO2 storage have also emerged, probably associated with changes in the MOC, which may influence the global variability in Fnet  (Chapter 9; DeVries et al., 2017). In the interior of the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean, and the North Atlantic, the increase in the CO2 inventory from 1994 to 2007 was about 20% smaller than expected from the atmospheric CO2 increase during the same period and the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in 1994 (Sabine eta al., 2004; Gruber et al., 2019a). There is medium confidence that the ocean CO2 inventory strengthened again in the decade 2005–2015 (DeVries et al., 2017). In the North Atlantic, a low rate of anthropogenic CO2 storage at 1.9 ± 0.4 PgC per decade during the time period of 1989–2003 increased to 4.4 ± 0.9 PgC per decade during 2003–2014. This is associated with changing ventilation patterns driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (Woosley et al., 2016). In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, the rate of anthropogenic CO2 storage also increased from 8.8 ± 1.1 (1σ) PgC per decade during 1995–2005 to 11.7 ± 1.1 PgC per decade during 2005–2015 (Carter et al., 2019). However, in the Subantarctic Mode Water of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the storage rate of the anthropogenic CO2 was rather lower after 2005 than before (Section 9.2.3.2; Tanhua et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019). These changes have been predominantly ascribed to the impact of changes in the MOC on the transport of anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior due to regional climate variability, in addition to the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Section 9.2.3.1; Wanninkhof et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2013; DeVries et al., 2017, 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; McKinley et al., 2020). However,the low frequency of carbon observations in the interior of the vast ocean leads to medium confidence in the assessment of temporal variability in the rate of regional ocean CO2 storage and its controlling mechanisms."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In summary, multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence provide  high confidence in the finding that the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 has increased quasi-linearly over the past 60 years in response to growing global emissions of anthropogenic CO2,  with a mean fraction of 23% of total emissions. The  high confidence assessment is moderated to medium confidence due to a number of ocean CO2 flux terms yet to be adequately constrained. Observed changes in the variability of oceanpCO2 and observed reductions in the mean global buffering capacity provide  high confidence that the growing CO2 sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry. However, there is medium confidence that these changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of Socean."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The global net land CO2 sink is assessed to have grown over the past six decades (Sarmiento et al., 2010; Ballantyne et al., 2017; Le Quéré et al., 2018b; Ciais et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020) (high confidence). Estimated as residual from the mass balance budget of fossil fuel CO2 emissions minus atmospheric CO2 growth and the ocean CO2 sink, the global net land CO2 sink (including both land CO2 sink and net land-use change emissions) increased from 0.3 ± 0.6 PgC yr–1 during the 1960s to 1.8 ± 0.8 PgC yr–1 during the 2010s (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). An increasing global net land CO2 sink since the 1980s (Figure 5.10) was consistently suggested both by atmospheric inversions (e.g., Peylin et al., 2013) and by DGVMs (e.g., Sitch et al., 2015; Friedlingstein et al., 2019). The Northern Hemisphere contributes more to the net increase in the land CO2 sink compared to the Southern Hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019), and boreal and temperate forests probably contribute the most (Tagesson et al., 2020). Attributing an increased net land CO2 sink to finer regional scales remains challenging, but inversions of satellite-based column CO2 products that have emerged since AR5 are a promising tool to further constrain regional land-atmosphere CO2 exchange (Ciais et al., 2013; Houweling et al., 2015; Reuter et al., 2017; O’Dell et al., 2018; Palmer et al., 2019)."

wg1_ch05_5.2.1.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Substantial progress has been made since AR5 on attributing change of the global net land CO2 sink. Increasing global net land CO2 sink since the 1980s is mainly driven by the fertilization effect from rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Schimel et al., 2015; Sitch et al., 2015; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019; O’Sullivan et al., 2019; Tagesson et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2021) (medium confidence). Increasing nitrogen deposition (de Vries et al., 2009; Devaraju et al., 2016; Huntzinger et al., 2017) or the synergy between increasing nitrogen deposition and atmospheric CO2 concentration (O’Sullivan et al., 2019) could have also contributed to the increasing global net land CO2 sink. The effects of climate change alone on the global net land CO2 sink is so divergent that even the signs (directions) of the effects are not the same across DGVMs (e.g., Huntzinger et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Lower fire emissions of CO2 and enhanced vegetation carbon uptake due to reduced global burned area have contributed to the increasing global net land CO2 sink in the recent decade (Arora and Melton, 2018; Yin et al., 2020) (low to medium confidence). Satellite observations reveal a declining trend in global burned area by about 20% over past two decades (Andela et al., 2017; Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Forkel et al., 2019), a trend most pronounced in regions like northern Africa (Forkel et al., 2019; Zubkova et al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020) and Mediterranean Europe (Turco et al., 2016). However, burned area trends are highly heterogeneous regionally with increasing trends reported in regions like western United States (Holden et al., 2018; Abatzoglou et al., 2019). Some regions (e.g., Amazon basin and Australia) experienced record-breaking fire events in 2019 and 2020 (e.g., Boer et al., 2020), whose effects on burned area trends remain to be explored. The burned area trends were primarily attributed to both human-induced climate change and human activities (Jolly et al., 2015; Andela et al., 2017; Holden et al., 2018; Turco et al., 2018; Teckentrup et al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020), as well as changing frequency of lightning in the boreal region (Veraverbeke et al., 2017). In addition to changes in the burned area, fire dynamics could affect the trend in land-atmosphere CO2 exchange indirectly through increasing concentration of air pollutants (see Section 6.3.4 for impacts of ozone and aerosol on the carbon cycle; Yue and Unger, 2018; Lasslop et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.1.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Significant uncertainties remain for the land CO2 sink partition of processes due to challenges in reconciling multiple-scale evidence from experiments to the globe (Fatichi et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2021), due to large spatial and inter-model differences in diagnosing dominant driving factors affecting the net land CO2 sink (Huntzinger et al., 2017; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019), and due to model deficiency in process representations (He et al., 2016). Nitrogen dynamics, a major gap in DGVMs identified in AR5, have now been incorporated in about half of the DGVMs contributing to the carbon budget of the Global Carbon Project (GCP) (see Le Quéré et al. (2018a)  for model characteristics) and a growing number of ESMs (Arora et al., 2020). However, as the representations of carbon–nitrogen interactions vary greatly among models, large uncertainties remain on how nitrogen cycling regulates the response of ecosystem carbon uptake to higher atmospheric CO2 (Walker et al., 2015; Wieder et al., 2019; Davies-Barnard et al., 2020; Meyerholt et al., 2020; see Section 5.4.1). Fire modules have been incorporated into 10 of 16 DGVMs contributing to the global carbon budget (Le Quéré et al., 2018a), and a growing number of models have representations of human ignitions and fire suppression processes (Rabin et al., 2017; Teckentrup et al., 2019). There are also growing DGVM developments to include management practices (Pongratz et al., 2018) and the effects of secondary forest regrowth (Pugh et al., 2019), though models still under-represent intensively managed ecosystems, such as croplands and managed forests (Guanter et al., 2014; Thurner et al., 2017). Processes that have not yet played a significant role in the land CO2 sink of the past decades but can grow in importance, include permafrost (Box 5.1) and peatlands dynamics (Dargie et al., 2017; Gibson et al., 2019), have also been incorporated in some DGVMs (Koven et al., 2015b; Burke et al., 2017a; Guimberteau et al., 2018). Growing numbers and varieties of Earth observations are being jointly used to drive and benchmark models, helping to further identify missing key processes or mechanisms that are poorly represented in the current generation of DGVMs (e.g., Collier et al., 2018)."

A set of new satellite measurements applied to assess the variability of the tropical land carbon balance since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) confirm this statement, including satellite column CO2 measurements, estimating the recent anomalous land–atmosphere CO2 exchange induced by El Niño at continental scale (e.g., J. Liu et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019), and L-band vegetation optical depth, estimating tropical above-ground biomass carbon stock changes (Fan et al., 2019). In addition, based onmedium evidence and medium agreement between studies with DGVMs and atmospheric inversions, semi-arid ecosystems over the tropical zones have a larger contribution to interannual variability in global land–atmosphere CO2 exchange than moist tropical forest ecosystems (low to medium confidence) (Poulter et al., 2014; Ahlstrom et al., 2015; Piao et al., 2020)."

Interannual variations in tropical land-atmosphere CO2 exchange are significantly correlated with anomalies of tropical temperature, water availability and terrestrial water storage (X. Wang et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018; Piao et al., 2020), whose relative contribution are difficult to separate due to covariations between these climatic factors. At continental scale, the dominant climatic driver of interannual variations of tropical land-atmosphere CO2 exchange was temperature variations (Figure 5.11; Piao et al., 2020), which could partly result from the spatial compensation of the water availability effects on land-atmospheric CO2 exchange (Jung et al., 2017)."

Since AR5 (Box 6.3), a growing body of evidence from tree-ring and carbon isotopes further confirms an increase of plant water-use efficiency over decadal to centennial time scales, with some evidence for a stronger enhancement of photosynthesis compared to stomatal reductions (Frank et al., 2015; Guerrieri et al., 2019; Adams et al., 2020)."

Both field-scale CO2 enrichment experiments and process models show the effect of physiologically induced water savings, particularly under water-limiting conditions (De Kauwe et al., 2013; Farrior et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2016). Plants can also benefit from reduced drought stress due to enhanced CO2 without ecosystem-scale water savings (Jiang et al., 2021). To some extent, this increased WUE offsets the effects of enhanced vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on plant transpiration (Bobich et al., 2010; Creese et al., 2014; Jiao et al., 2019), but will have limited effect on ameliorating plant water stress during extreme drought events (Xu et al., 2016; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; L.

However, these projections are subject to ESM uncertainties to quantify transpiration (Lian et al., 2021), among them the correct representations of plant hydraulic architecture such as changes in xylem anatomical properties and deep rooting (Nie et al., 2013; L.

Increased CO2 concentrations alleviate the effects of water deficits on plant productivity (medium confidence) but there is low confidence for its role under extreme drought conditions.

This makes water availability a major climatic driver of variability in net ecosystem exchange (Jung et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018). In addition to suppressing photosynthesis, field evidence suggests that droughts reduce the land CO2 sink, also through increasing forest mortality and promoting wildfire (Allen et al., 2015; Brando et al., 2019; Abram et al., 2021)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p11,5.2.1.5 CO,"At the global scale, interannual variability in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate and global-scale terrestrial water storage from satellite show that a lower global net land CO2 sink is associated with below-average terrestrial water storage (Humphrey et al., 2018). Atmospheric inversions based on surface and satellite column CO2 measurements show significant carbon release during drought events in pan-tropic areas (Phillips et al., 2009; Gatti et al., 2014; J. Liu et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019). Regional extreme droughts in the mid-latitudes also decrease GPP and land CO2 sink (Ciais et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2016; W. Peters et al., 2020; Flach et al., 2021). Droughts are not compensated by equivalent wet anomalies because of the non-linear response of the terrestrial carbon uptake to soil moisture (Green et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p12,5.2.1.5 CO,"Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of sensitivity of the land carbon fluxes to droughts. Global studies indicate stronger control of soil moisture to variations in satellite proxies of GPP than VPD (Stocker et al., 2019; L. Liu et al., 2020). However, given that VPD increases exponentially with atmospheric warming, some studies suggest that VPD in stomatal regulation will become increasingly more important under a warmer climate (Novick et al., 2016; Grossiord et al., 2020). It is difficult to isolate the relative contributions of warmer temperature, higher VPD and lower soil moisture. This is because land-atmosphere feedbacks cause a simultaneous increase of plant evaporative demand and of root zone water deficit impairing plant root uptake (Berg et al., 2016). These physiological responses can be further compounded by drought legacies (Anderegg et al., 2015), changes in structure and population dynamics due to forest mortality (McDowell et al., 2020), disturbances associated with drought (fire, insects damage; Anderegg et al., 2020) and possible trade-offs between resistance and resilience (X. Li et al., 2020). Nonetheless, ESMs suggest that increased drought effects under very high levels of global warming (about 4°C at the end of the 21st century) contribute to the reduced efficiency of the land sink (Green et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p13,5.2.1.5 CO,"In conclusion, there is  high confidence that the global net land CO2 sink is reduced on interannual scale when regional-scale reductions in water availability associated with droughts occur, particularly in tropical regions. There is also  high confidence that the global land sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and associated drought conditions in some regions for high-emissions scenarios, specially under global warming above 4°C. However, there is low confidence on how these water cycle feedbacks will play out in lower emissions scenarios (at 2°C global warming or lower) due to uncertainties in regional rainfall changes and the balance between the CO2 fertilization effect, through WUE, and the radiative impacts of greenhouse gases."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p15,5.2.1.5 CO,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options based on terrestrial carbon sinks will require the appropriation of significant amounts of water at the landscape level. Most mitigation pathways that seek to limit global warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C require the removal of about 30 to 300 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and afforestation/reforestation are the dominant CDR options used in climate stabilization scenarios, implying large requirements for land and water (Section 5.6; Beringer et al., 2011; Boysen et al., 2017b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017; Jans et al., 2018; Séférian et al., 2018b; Yamagata et al., 2018; Stenzel et al., 2019). A review of freshwater requirements for irrigating biomass plantations shows a range between 15 and 1250 km3 per GtC of biomass harvest. This is equivalent to a water requirement of 99–8250 km3 for the median BECCS deployment of around 3.3 GtC yr−1 (Smith et al., 2016) in <2°C-scenarios (Stenzel et al., 2021), assuming that biomass is converted to electricity, which is substantially less efficient than converting biomass to heat. These large ranges are the result of different assumptions about the type of biomass and yield improvements, management, and land availability. The use of alternative feedstocks, such as wastes, residues and algae, would lead to smaller water requirements (Smith et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p16,5.2.1.5 CO,"Most of the water consumed in BECCS is used to grow the feedstock, with carbon capture and storage constituting a smaller portion across all crops (Rosa et al., 2020), with an estimated evaporative loss of 260 km3yr−1 for 3.3 GtC yr−1 (Smith et al., 2016). The same authors also estimate water use for CDR through afforestation at 1040 km3yr−1 for 3.3 GtC yr−1, including interception and transpiration, adjusted for the original land cover’s water use."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p17,5.2.1.5 CO,"The impacts of different CDR options on the water cycle depend crucially on regional climate, prior land cover, and scale of deployment (Trabucco et al., 2008). Extensive irrigation for afforestation in drier areas will have larger downstream impacts than in wetter regions, with the difference in water use between the afforested landscapes and its previous vegetation determining the level of potential impacts on evapotranspiration and runoff (Jackson et al., 2005; Teuling et al., 2017). Afforestation and reforestation sometimes enhances precipitation through atmospheric feedbacks such as increased convection, at least in the tropics (Ellison et al., 2017) and the increase in precipitation can, in some regions, even cancel out the increased evapotranspiration (Li et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.1_p18,5.2.1.5 CO,"In conclusion, extensive deployment of BECCS and afforestation/reforestation will require larger amounts of freshwater resources than used by the previous vegetation, altering the water cycle at regional scales (high confidence). Consequences of high water consumption on downstream uses, biodiversity, and regional climate depend on prior land cover, background climate conditions, and scale of deployment (high confidence). Therefore, a regional approach is required to determine the efficacy and sustainability of CDR projects."

wg1_ch05_5.2.2_p1,5.2.2.1 Atmosphere,"Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 (Chapter 7) and participates in tropospheric chemistry (Chapter 6). The CH4 variability in the atmosphere is mainly the result of the net balance between the sources and sinks on the Earth’s surface and chemical losses in the atmosphere. Atmospheric transport evens out the regional CH4 differences between different parts of the Earth’s atmosphere. The steady-state lifetime is estimated to be 9.1 ± 0.9 years (Section 6.3.1 and Table 6.2). About 90% of the loss of atmospheric CH4 occurs in the troposphere by reaction with hydroxyl radical (OH), 5% by bacterial soil oxidation, and the rest 5% by chemical reactions with OH, excited state oxygen (O1D), and atomic chlorine (Cl) in the stratosphere (Saunois et al., 2020). Methane has large emissions from natural and anthropogenic origins, but a clear demarcation of their nature is difficult because of the use and conversions of the natural ecosystem for human activities. The largest natural sources are from wetlands, freshwater and geological process, while the largest anthropogenic emissions are from enteric fermentation and manure treatment, landfills and waste treatment, rice cultivation and fossil fuel exploitation (Table 5.2). In the past two centuries, CH4 emissions have nearly doubled, predominantly human driven since 1900, and persistently exceeded the losses (virtually certain), thereby increasing the atmospheric abundance as evidenced from the ice core and firn air measurements (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2_p3,5.2.2.1 Atmosphere,"This section discusses both bottom-up and top-down estimates of emissions and sinks. Bottom-up estimates are based on empirical upscaling of point measurements, emissions inventories and dynamical model simulations, while top-down estimates refer to those constrained by atmospheric measurements and chemistry-transport models in inversion systems. Since AR5, a larger suite of atmospheric inversions using both in situ and remote sensing measurement have led to better understanding of the regional CH4 sources (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2). New ice core measurements of14C-CH4 are used for estimating the geological sources of CH4 (Table 5.2). Compared to the SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a; Jia et al., 2019), we provide a whole atmospheric sources-sinks budget consisting of all emissions and losses."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since the start of direct measurements of CH4 in the atmosphere in the 1970s (Figure 5.13), the highest growth rate was observed from 1977 to 1986 at 18 ± 4 ppb yr–1 (multi-year mean and 1 standard deviation) (Rice et al., 2016). This rapid CH4 growth followed the green revolution with increased crop production and a fast rate of industrialization that caused rapid increases in CH4 emissions from ruminant animals, rice cultivation, landfills, oil and gas industry and coal mining (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015; Crippa et al., 2020). Due to increases in oil prices in the early 1980s, emissions from gas flaring declined significantly (Stern and Kaufmann, 1996). This explains the first reduction in CH4 growth rates from 1985 to 1990 (Steele et al., 1992; Chandra et al., 2021). Further emissions reductions occurred following the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 that triggered a reduction in CH4 growth rate through a decrease in wetland emissions driven by lower surface temperatures due to the light scattering by aerosols (Bândă et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2021). In the late 1990s through to 2006 there was a temporary pause in the CH4 growth rate, with higher confidence on its causes than in AR5: emissions from the oil and gas sectors declined by about 10 Tg yr–1through the 1990s, and atmospheric CH4 loss steadily increased (Dlugokencky et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2012; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). The methane growth rate began to increase again at 7 ± 3 ppb yr–1 during 2007–2016, the causes of which are highly debated since AR5 (Rigby et al., 2008; Dlugokencky et al., 2011; Dalsøren et al., 2016; Nisbet et al., 2016; Patra et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2017; Worden et al., 2017; He et al., 2020); studies disagree on the relative contribution of thermogenic, pyrogenic and biogenic emission processes and variability in tropospheric OH concentration. The renewed CH4 increase is accompanied by a reversal of d13C trend to more negative values post 2007; opposite to what occurred in the 200 years prior (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Nisbet et al., 2019), suggesting an increasing contribution from animal farming, landfills and waste, and a slower increase in emissions from fossil fuel exploitation since the early 2000s (Patra et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 reached 1866.3 ppb in 2019 (Figure 5.14). A comprehensive assessment of the CH4 growth rates over the past four decades is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 5.2."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The positive gradient between CH4 at Cape Grim, Australia (41°S) and Trinidad Head, USA (41°N), and the bigger difference between Trinidad Head and global mean CH4 compared to that between global mean CH4 and Cape Grim, strongly suggest that the Northern Hemisphere is the dominant origin of anthropogenic CH4 emissions (Figure 5.13). The loss rate of CH4 in troposphere does not produce a large positive north–south hemispheric gradient in CH4 due to parity in hemispheric mean OH concentration (Patra et al., 2014), or in the case of greater OH concentrations in the northern rather than the Southern Hemisphere as simulated by the chemistry-climate models (Naik et al., 2013). Coal mining contributed about 35% of the total CH4 emissions from all fossil fuel-related sources. Top-down estimates of fossil fuel emissions (106 Tg yr–1) are smaller than bottom-up estimates (115 Tg yr–1) during 2008–2017 (Table 5.2). Inventory-based estimates suggest that CH4 emissions from coal mining increased by 17 Tg yr–1 between the periods 2002–2006 and 2008–2012, with a dominant contribution from China (Peng et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020). Inventory-based estimates suggest that CH4 emissions from coal mining increased by 17 Tg yr–1 between the periods 2002–2006 and 2008–2012, with a dominant contribution from China (Peng et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020). Recent country statistics and detailed inventory-based estimates show that CH4 emissions from coal mining in China declined between 2012 and 2016 (Sheng et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020), while atmospheric-based estimates suggest a continuation of CH4 emissions growth but at a slower rate to the year 2015 (Miller et al., 2019) and 2016 (Chandra et al., 2021). Emissions from oil and gas extraction and use decreased in the 1980s and 1990s, but increased in the 2000s and 2010s (Dlugokencky et al., 1994; Stern and Kaufmann, 1996; Howarth, 2019; Crippa et al., 2020). The attribution to multiple CH4 sources using spatially aggregated atmospheric d13C data remained underdetermined to infer the global total emissions from the fossil fuel industry, biomass burning and agriculture (Rice et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Worden et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2018)."

Emissions from enteric fermentation and manure have increased gradually from about 87 Tg yr–1 in 1990–1999 to 109 Tg yr–1 in 2008–2017 mainly due to the increase in global total animal numbers. Methane production in livestock rumens (cattle, goats, sheep, water buffalo) are affected by the type, amount and quality of feeds, energy consumption, animal size, health and growth rate, meat and milk production rate, and temperature (Broucek, 2014; S.R.O.

There is recent evidence from the tropics that fire occurrence is non-linearly related to precipitation, implying that severe droughts will increase CH4 emissions from fires, particularly from the degraded peatlands (Field et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Freshwater wetlands are the single largest global natural source of CH4 in the atmosphere, accounting for about 26% of the total CH4 source (robust evidence, medium agreement). Progress has been made since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) in better constraining freshwater lake and river emissions and reducing double counting with wetland emissions. Bottom-up and top-down estimates for 2008–2017 are 149 and 180 Tg yr–1, respectively, with a top-down uncertainty range of 159–199 Tg yr–1 (Table 5.2). The large uncertainties stem from challenges in mapping wetland area and temporal dynamics to landscape estimates, and in scaling methane production, transport and consumption processes that are measured with small chambers or flux towers (Pham-Duc et al., 2017). Both the top-down and bottom-up estimates presented in Table 5.2 indicate little increase in wetland CH4 emissions during the last three decades, with the new estimates being slightly smaller than in AR5 due to updated wetland maps and ecosystem model simulations (Melton et al., 2013; Poulter et al., 2017). Wetland emissions show strong interannual variability due to the changes in inundated land area, air temperature and microbial activity (Bridgham et al., 2013). Present terrestrial ecosystem model simulated CH4 emissions variability does not produce strong correlation with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), although observation evidence is emerging for lower CH4 emissions during El Niños and greater emissions during La Niña (Pandey et al., 2017)."

The contribution of trees in transporting CH4 may further widen the gap between the bottom-up and top-down estimates in the global budget, particularly needing a re-assessment of emissions in the tropics and in forested wetlands of temperate and boreal regions (Pangala et al., 2017; Jeffrey et al., 2019; Welch et al., 2019; Sjögersten et al., 2020)."

The estimate of global methane loss by microbial oxidation in upland soils has been lowered marginally by 4 Tg yr–1, compared to 34 Tg yr–1 in AR5, for the period 2000–2009. Termites, an infraorder of insects (Isoptera) found in almost all land masses, emitted about 9 Tg yr–1 of CH4 in 2000–2009.

Coastal oceans, fjords and mud volcanos are major sources of CH4 in the marine environment, but CH4 flux measurements are sparse. Saunois et al. (2020) estimate that the oceanic budget, including biogenic, geological and hydrate emissions from coastal and open ocean, is 6 (range 4–10) Tg yr–1 for the 2000s, which is in good agreement with an air–sea flux measurement-based estimate of 6–12 Tg yr–1 (Weber et al., 2019). When estuaries are included, the total oceanic budget is 9–22 Tg yr–1, with a mean value of 13 Tg yr–1. A recent synthesis suggests that CH4 emissions from shallow coastal ecosystems, particularly from mangroves, can be as high as 5–6 Tg yr–1 (Al-Haj and Fulweiler, 2020). The reservoir emissions, including coastal wetlands and tidal flats, contribute up to 13 Tg yr–1 (Borges and Abril, 2011; Deemer et al., 2016). Methane seepage from the Arctic shelf, possibly triggered by the loss of geological storage due to warming and thawing of permafrost and hydrate decomposition, has a wide estimated range of 0.0–17 Tg yr–1 (Shakhova et al., 2010, 2014, 2017; Berchet et al., 2016); advanced eddy covariance measurements put the best estimate at about 3 Tg yr–1 from the East Siberian Arctic shelf (Thornton et al., 2020). The current flux is expected  to be a mix of pre-industrial and climate change-driven fluxes, CH4 seepage is anticipated to increase in a warmer world (Dean et al., 2018)."

There is evidence that the ventilation of geological CH4 is likely  to be smaller than 15 Tg yr–1 (Petrenko et al., 2017; Hmiel et al., 2020). A lower geological CH4 ventilation will reduce the gap between bottom-up and top-down estimates (Table 5.2), but widen the gap in the ratio of fossil fuel-derived sources to the biogenic sources for matching the D14C-CH4 observations."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Inland water (lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, estuaries) emissions are proportionally the largest source of uncertainty in the CH4 budget. Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013), the inland water CH4 source has been revised from 8–73 Tg yr–1 (1980s) to 117–212 Tg yr–1 (2000s) with the availability of more observational data and improved areal estimates (Bastviken et al., 2011; Deemer et al., 2016; Stanley et al., 2016; DelSontro et al., 2018; Saunois et al., 2020). However, it is difficult to estimate bottom-up CH4 emissions, due to the large spatial and temporal variation in lake and river CH4 fluxes (Wik et al., 2016; Crawford et al., 2017; Natchimuthu et al., 2017), uncertainties in their global area (Allen and Pavelsky, 2018), a relatively small number of observations, and varying measurement methods – for example, those neglecting ebullition, varying upscaling methods, and lack of appropriate processes (Sanches et al., 2019; Engram et al., 2020; L. Zhang et al., 2020). Accordingly, there is no clear accounting of inland waters in top-down budgets, which is the main reason for the large gap in bottom-up and top-down estimates of ‘other sources’ in the CH4 budget (Table 5.2). Despite recent progress in separating wetlands from inland waters, there is double-counting in the bottom-up estimates of their emissions (Thornton et al., 2016a). Although there is evidence that regional human activities and global warming both increase inland water CH4 emissions (Beaulieu et al., 2019), the increase in the decadal emissions since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) rather reflect improvements in the estimate (medium confidence), due to updates in the datasets and new upscaling approaches (Saunois et al., 2020)."

The decadal mean CH44 burden/imbalance increased at the rate of 30, 12, 7 and 21 Tg yr–1 in the 1980s (1980–1989), 1990s (1990–1999), 2000s (2000–2009) and the most recent decade (2008–2017), respectively (virtually certain), as can be estimated from observed atmospheric growth rate (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 1)."

However, recent model simulations produce fairly consistent d13C-CH4 values and trends, as observed in the atmospheric samples using 20% fossil fuel emissions fraction (Ghosh et al., 2015; Warwick et al., 2016; Fujita et al., 2020; Strode et al., 2020). Further research is needed to clarify the relative roles of CH4 emissions from fossil fuel exploitation and freshwater components. A key challenge is to accommodate the higher estimated emissions from these two components without a major increase in the sinks, in order to be consistent with the observed changes in the carbon and hydrogen isotopes."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since the start of direct measurements of CH4 in the atmosphere in the 1970s (Figure 5.13), the highest growth rate was observed from 1977 to 1986 at 18 ± 4 ppb yr–1 (multi-year mean and 1 standard deviation) (Rice et al., 2016). This rapid CH4 growth followed the green revolution with increased crop production and a fast rate of industrialization that caused rapid increases in CH4 emissions from ruminant animals, rice cultivation, landfills, oil and gas industry and coal mining (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015; Crippa et al., 2020). Due to increases in oil prices in the early 1980s, emissions from gas flaring declined significantly (Stern and Kaufmann, 1996). This explains the first reduction in CH4 growth rates from 1985 to 1990 (Steele et al., 1992; Chandra et al., 2021). Further emissions reductions occurred following the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 that triggered a reduction in CH4 growth rate through a decrease in wetland emissions driven by lower surface temperatures due to the light scattering by aerosols (Bândă et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2021). In the late 1990s through to 2006 there was a temporary pause in the CH4 growth rate, with higher confidence on its causes than in AR5: emissions from the oil and gas sectors declined by about 10 Tg yr–1through the 1990s, and atmospheric CH4 loss steadily increased (Dlugokencky et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2012; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). The methane growth rate began to increase again at 7 ± 3 ppb yr–1 during 2007–2016, the causes of which are highly debated since AR5 (Rigby et al., 2008; Dlugokencky et al., 2011; Dalsøren et al., 2016; Nisbet et al., 2016; Patra et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2017; Worden et al., 2017; He et al., 2020); studies disagree on the relative contribution of thermogenic, pyrogenic and biogenic emission processes and variability in tropospheric OH concentration. The renewed CH4 increase is accompanied by a reversal of d13C trend to more negative values post 2007; opposite to what occurred in the 200 years prior (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Nisbet et al., 2019), suggesting an increasing contribution from animal farming, landfills and waste, and a slower increase in emissions from fossil fuel exploitation since the early 2000s (Patra et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 reached 1866.3 ppb in 2019 (Figure 5.14). A comprehensive assessment of the CH4 growth rates over the past four decades is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 5.2."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The positive gradient between CH4 at Cape Grim, Australia (41°S) and Trinidad Head, USA (41°N), and the bigger difference between Trinidad Head and global mean CH4 compared to that between global mean CH4 and Cape Grim, strongly suggest that the Northern Hemisphere is the dominant origin of anthropogenic CH4 emissions (Figure 5.13). The loss rate of CH4 in troposphere does not produce a large positive north–south hemispheric gradient in CH4 due to parity in hemispheric mean OH concentration (Patra et al., 2014), or in the case of greater OH concentrations in the northern rather than the Southern Hemisphere as simulated by the chemistry-climate models (Naik et al., 2013). Coal mining contributed about 35% of the total CH4 emissions from all fossil fuel-related sources. Top-down estimates of fossil fuel emissions (106 Tg yr–1) are smaller than bottom-up estimates (115 Tg yr–1) during 2008–2017 (Table 5.2). Inventory-based estimates suggest that CH4 emissions from coal mining increased by 17 Tg yr–1 between the periods 2002–2006 and 2008–2012, with a dominant contribution from China (Peng et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020). Inventory-based estimates suggest that CH4 emissions from coal mining increased by 17 Tg yr–1 between the periods 2002–2006 and 2008–2012, with a dominant contribution from China (Peng et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020). Recent country statistics and detailed inventory-based estimates show that CH4 emissions from coal mining in China declined between 2012 and 2016 (Sheng et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020), while atmospheric-based estimates suggest a continuation of CH4 emissions growth but at a slower rate to the year 2015 (Miller et al., 2019) and 2016 (Chandra et al., 2021). Emissions from oil and gas extraction and use decreased in the 1980s and 1990s, but increased in the 2000s and 2010s (Dlugokencky et al., 1994; Stern and Kaufmann, 1996; Howarth, 2019; Crippa et al., 2020). The attribution to multiple CH4 sources using spatially aggregated atmospheric d13C data remained underdetermined to infer the global total emissions from the fossil fuel industry, biomass burning and agriculture (Rice et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Worden et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2018)."

Emissions from enteric fermentation and manure have increased gradually from about 87 Tg yr–1 in 1990–1999 to 109 Tg yr–1 in 2008–2017 mainly due to the increase in global total animal numbers. Methane production in livestock rumens (cattle, goats, sheep, water buffalo) are affected by the type, amount and quality of feeds, energy consumption, animal size, health and growth rate, meat and milk production rate, and temperature (Broucek, 2014; S.R.O. Williams et al., 2020; SRCCLSection 5.4.3). Waste management and landfills produced 64 Tg yr–1 in 2008–2017, with global emissions increasing steadily since the 1970s and, despite significant declines in the USA, western Europe and Japan (Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020)."

There is recent evidence from the tropics that fire occurrence is non-linearly related to precipitation, implying that severe droughts will increase CH4 emissions from fires, particularly from the degraded peatlands (Field et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Freshwater wetlands are the single largest global natural source of CH4 in the atmosphere, accounting for about 26% of the total CH4 source (robust evidence, medium agreement). Progress has been made since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) in better constraining freshwater lake and river emissions and reducing double counting with wetland emissions. Bottom-up and top-down estimates for 2008–2017 are 149 and 180 Tg yr–1, respectively, with a top-down uncertainty range of 159–199 Tg yr–1 (Table 5.2). The large uncertainties stem from challenges in mapping wetland area and temporal dynamics to landscape estimates, and in scaling methane production, transport and consumption processes that are measured with small chambers or flux towers (Pham-Duc et al., 2017). Both the top-down and bottom-up estimates presented in Table 5.2 indicate little increase in wetland CH4 emissions during the last three decades, with the new estimates being slightly smaller than in AR5 due to updated wetland maps and ecosystem model simulations (Melton et al., 2013; Poulter et al., 2017). Wetland emissions show strong interannual variability due to the changes in inundated land area, air temperature and microbial activity (Bridgham et al., 2013). Present terrestrial ecosystem model simulated CH4 emissions variability does not produce strong correlation with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), although observation evidence is emerging for lower CH4 emissions during El Niños and greater emissions during La Niña (Pandey et al., 2017)."

The contribution of trees in transporting CH4 may further widen the gap between the bottom-up and top-down estimates in the global budget, particularly needing a re-assessment of emissions in the tropics and in forested wetlands of temperate and boreal regions (Pangala et al., 2017; Jeffrey et al., 2019; Welch et al., 2019; Sjögersten et al., 2020)."

The estimate of global methane loss by microbial oxidation in upland soils has been lowered marginally by 4 Tg yr–1, compared to 34 Tg yr–1 in AR5, for the period 2000–2009. Termites, an infraorder of insects (Isoptera) found in almost all land masses, emitted about 9 Tg yr–1 of CH4 in 2000–2009.

wg1_ch05_5.2.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"In AR5, the ocean CH4 emissions were reported together with geological emissions, summing up to 54 (33–75) Tg yr–1. Coastal oceans, fjords and mud volcanos are major sources of CH4 in the marine environment, but CH4 flux measurements are sparse. Saunois et al. (2020) estimate that the oceanic budget, including biogenic, geological and hydrate emissions from coastal and open ocean, is 6 (range 4–10) Tg yr–1 for the 2000s, which is in good agreement with an air–sea flux measurement-based estimate of 6–12 Tg yr–1 (Weber et al., 2019). When estuaries are included, the total oceanic budget is 9–22 Tg yr–1, with a mean value of 13 Tg yr–1. A recent synthesis suggests that CH4 emissions from shallow coastal ecosystems, particularly from mangroves, can be as high as 5–6 Tg yr–1 (Al-Haj and Fulweiler, 2020). The reservoir emissions, including coastal wetlands and tidal flats, contribute up to 13 Tg yr–1 (Borges and Abril, 2011; Deemer et al., 2016). Methane seepage from the Arctic shelf, possibly triggered by the loss of geological storage due to warming and thawing of permafrost and hydrate decomposition, has a wide estimated range of 0.0–17 Tg yr–1 (Shakhova et al., 2010, 2014, 2017; Berchet et al., 2016); advanced eddy covariance measurements put the best estimate at about 3 Tg yr–1 from the East Siberian Arctic shelf (Thornton et al., 2020).

However, it is difficult to estimate bottom-up CH4 emissions, due to the large spatial and temporal variation in lake and river CH4 fluxes (Wik et al., 2016; Crawford et al., 2017; Natchimuthu et al., 2017), uncertainties in their global area (Allen and Pavelsky, 2018), a relatively small number of observations, and varying measurement methods – for example, those neglecting ebullition, varying upscaling methods, and lack of appropriate processes (Sanches et al., 2019; Engram et al., 2020; L.

Accordingly, there is no clear accounting of inland waters in top-down budgets, which is the main reason for the large gap in bottom-up and top-down estimates of ‘other sources’ in the CH4 budget (Table 5.2). Despite recent progress in separating wetlands from inland waters, there is double-counting in the bottom-up estimates of their emissions (Thornton et al., 2016a). Although there is evidence that regional human activities and global warming both increase inland water CH4 emissions (Beaulieu et al., 2019), the increase in the decadal emissions since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) rather reflect improvements in the estimate (medium confidence), due to updates in the datasets and new upscaling approaches (Saunois et al., 2020)."

Atmospheric CH4 grew faster (9.3 ± 2.4 ppb yr–1) over the last six years (2014–2019) – a period with prolonged El Niño conditions, which contributed to high CH4 growth rates consistent with behaviour during previous El Niño events (Figure 5.14b). Because of large uncertainties in both the emissions and sinks of CH4, it has been challenging to quantify accurately the methane budget and ascribe reasons for the growth over 1980–2019. In the context of CH4 emissions mitigation, it is critical to understand if the changes in growth rates are caused by emissions from human activities or by natural processes responding to changing climate. If CH4 continues to grow at rates similar to those observed over the past decade, it will contribute to decadal scale climate change and hinder the achievement of the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement (Section 7.3.2.2; Nisbet et al., 2019)."

Proposed hypotheses for CH4 growth (2007–2017) are inconclusive and vary from a concurrent decrease in thermogenic and increase in wetland and other biogenic emissions (Nisbet et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016), an increase in emissions from agriculture in the tropics (Schaefer et al., 2016), a concurrent reduction in pyrogenic emissions and an increase in thermogenic emissions (Worden et al., 2017), or an emissions increase from biogenic sources and a slower increase in emissions from thermogenic sources compared to inventory emissions (Patra et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021)."

Shorter-term decadal variability is predominantly driven by the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation on emissions from wetlands and biomass burning (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), and loss due to OH variations (medium confidence), but lacking quantitative contribution from each of the sectors. By synthesizing all available information regionally from a priori (bottom-up) emissions, satellite and surface observations, including isotopic information, and inverse modelling (top-down), the capacity to track and explain changes in, and drivers of, natural and anthropogenic CH4 regional and global emissions has improved since AR5, but fundamental uncertainties related to OH variations remain unchanged."
wg1_ch05_5.2.3_p1,5.2.3.1 Atmosphere,"In natural ecosystems, nitrous oxide (N2O) is primarily produced as a by-product during the remineralization of organic matter via the primary processes of nitrification and denitrification (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Voss et al., 2013). The net N2O production is highly sensitive to local environmental conditions such as temperature, oxygen concentrations, pH and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrate, among others, causing strong variability of N2O emissions in time and space, even at small scales. Changes in the atmospheric abundance of N2O result largely from the balance of the net N2O sources on land and ocean, and the photochemical destruction of N2O in the stratosphere."

The long atmospheric lifetime of N2O implies that it will take more than a century before atmospheric abundances stabilize after the stabilization of global emissions.

Despite uncertainties because of the side effects of canals and reservoirs on nutrient cycling, these advances permit attribution of a fraction of inland water N2O emissions to anthropogenic sources (Tian et al., 2020), which contributes to the increased anthropogenic share of the global N2O source in this report compared to AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013). As an indirect consequence of agricultural nitrogen use and waste-water treatment, the anthropogenic emissions from inland waters have increased by about a quarter (0.1 TgN yr–1) between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (Tian et al., 2020)."

Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved capacity to estimate N2O sources from atmospheric N2O measurements by inverting models of atmospheric transport provides a new and independent constraint for the global N2O budget (Saikawa et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). The decadal mean source derived from these inversions is remarkably consistent with the bottom-up global N2O budget for the same period, however, the split between land and ocean sources based on atmospheric inversions is less constrained, yielding a smaller land source of 11.3 (10.2 to 13.2) TgN yr–1 and a larger ocean source of 5.7 (3.4 to 7.2) TgN yr–1, respectively, compared to bottom-up estimates."

wg1_ch05_5.2.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Inland waters and estuaries are generally sources of N2O as a result of nitrification and denitrification of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, however, they can serve as N2O sinks in specific conditions (Webb et al., 2019). Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved emissions factors, including their spatio-temporal scaling, and consideration of transport within the aquatic system allows for better constraint of these emissions (Murray et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Lauerwald et al., 2019; Maavara et al., 2019; Kortelainen et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Despite uncertainties because of the side effects of canals and reservoirs on nutrient cycling, these advances permit attribution of a fraction of inland water N2O emissions to anthropogenic sources (Tian et al., 2020), which contributes to the increased anthropogenic share of the global N2O source in this report compared to AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013). As an indirect consequence of agricultural nitrogen use and waste-water treatment, the anthropogenic emissions from inland waters have increased by about a quarter (0.1 TgN yr–1) between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (Tian et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.3.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Soils are the largest natural source of N2O, arising primarily from nitrogen processing associated with microbial nitrification and denitrification (Table 5.3; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Snider et al., 2015). Under some conditions, soils can also act as a net sink of N2O, but this effect is small compared to the overall source (Schlesinger, 2013). Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved global process-based models (Tian et al., 2019) suggest a present-day source of 6.7 (5.3–8.1) TgN yr–1 (2007–2016 average), which is consistent with the estimate in AR5. Process-based models and inventory-based methods show that increased N deposition has enhanced terrestrial N2O emissions by 0.8 (0.4–1.4 TgN yr–1) relative to approximately pre-industrial times, and by 0.2 (0.1–0.2) TgN yr–1 between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (limited evidence, medium agreement) (Figure 5.16; Tian et al., 2019). This estimate is at the high end of the range reported in AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3). Model projections further show that global warming has led to increased soil N2O emissions of 0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr–1 since approximately pre-industrial times, of which about half occurred since the 1980s (limited evidence,  high agreement) (Tian et al., 2019, 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.3.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"The SRCCL assessed that deforestation and other forms of land-use change significantly alter terrestrial N2O emissions through emission pulses following conversions, generally resulting in long-term reduced emissions in unfertilized ecosystems (medium evidence, high agreement). This conclusion is supported by a recent study demonstrating that the deforestation-pulse effect is offset by the effect of reduced area of mature tropical forests (Tian et al., 2020)."

Emerging literature suggests that permafrost thaw may contribute significantly to arctic N2O emissions (Voigt et al., 2020), but these processes are not yet adequately represented in models and upscaling to large-scale remains a significant challenge."
wg1_ch05_5.2.3.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"The synthesis of bottom-up estimates of N2O sources (Sections 5.2.3.2–5.2.3.4 and Figure 5.17) yields a global source of 17.0 (12.2 to 23.5) TgN yr–1 for the years 2007–2016 (Table 5.3). This estimate is comparable to AR5, but the uncertainty range has been reduced primarily due to improved estimates of ocean and anthropogenic N2O sources. Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved capacity to estimate N2O sources from atmospheric N2O measurements by inverting models of atmospheric transport provides a new and independent constraint for the global N2O budget (Saikawa et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). The decadal mean source derived from these inversions is remarkably consistent with the bottom-up global N2O budget for the same period, however, the split between land and ocean sources based on atmospheric inversions is less constrained, yielding a smaller land source of 11.3 (10.2 to 13.2) TgN yr–1 and a larger ocean source of 5.7 (3.4 to 7.2) TgN yr–1, respectively, compared to bottom-up estimates."

This estimate is larger than in AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3) due to a larger estimated effect of nitrogen deposition on soil N2O emissions and the explicit consideration of the role of anthropogenic nitrogen in determining inland water and estuary emissions."

Atmospheric inversions indicate that changes in surface emissions, rather than in the atmospheric transport or sink of N2O, are the cause for the increased atmospheric growth rate of N2O (robust evidence, high agreement) (Thompson et al., 2019). However, the increase of 1.6 (1.4 to 1.7) TgN yr–1 in global emissions between 2000–2005 and 2010–2015 based on atmospheric inversions is somewhat larger than bottom-up estimates over the same period, primarily because of differences in the estimates of land-based emissions."
wg1_ch05_5.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The total influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) on the Earth’s radiative balance is driven by the combined effect of those gases, and the three most important – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) – were discussed in the previous sections. This section compares the balance of the sources and sinks of these three gases and their regional net flux contributions to the radiative forcing. CO2 has multiple residence times in the atmosphere – from one year to many thousands of years (Box 6.1 in Ciais et al., 2013) – and N2O has a mean lifetime of 116 years. They are both long-lived GHGs, while CH4 has a lifetime of 9.1 years and is considered a short-lived GHG (see Chapter 2 for lifetime of GHGs, Chapter 6 for CH4 chemical lifetime, and Chapter 7 for effective radiative forcing of all GHGs)."
wg1_ch05_5.2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Figure 5.18 shows the contribution to radiative forcing of CO2, CH4, N2O, and the halogenated species since the 1900s to more recent decades. For the period 1960–2019, the relative contribution to the total effective radiative forcing (ERF) was 63% for CO2, 11% for CH4, 6% for N2O, and 17% for the halogenated species (Chapter 7; Figure 5.18). The systematic decline in the relative contribution to ERF for CH4 since 1850 is caused by a slower increase rate of CH4 in the recent decades, at 6, 10 and 5 ppb yr–1 during 1850–2019, 1960–2019 and 2000–2019, respectively, in comparison with the increasing rate of CO2 (at 0.7, 1.6 and 2.2 ppm yr–1, respectively) and N2O (at 0.4, 0.7 and 0.9 ppb yr–1, respectively; Figure 5.4). Owing to the shorter lifetime of CH4, the effect of a reduction in the emissions increase rate on the ERF increase is evident at inter-decadal time scales."
wg1_ch05_5.2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Atmospheric abundance of GHGs is proportional to their emissions-loss budgets in the Earth’s environment. There are multiple metrics to evaluate the relative importance of different GHGs for the global atmospheric radiation budget and the socio-economic impacts (Section 7.6). Metrics for weighting emissions are further developed in AR6 WGIII. Figure 5.19 shows the regional emissions of the three main GHGs. For North Asia, Europe, Temperate North America and West Asia, the most dominant GHG source is CO2 (high confidence) (Figure 5.19) while, for East Asia, South Asia, South East Asia, Tropical South America, Temperate North America and Central Africa, the source is CH4 (Figure 5.19). The N2O emissions are dominant in regions with intense use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. Only boreal North America showed net sinks of CO2, while close to flux neutrality is observed for North Asia, Southern Africa, and Australasia. Persistent emissions of CO2 are observed for Tropical and South America, northern Africa, and South East Asia (medium confidence). The medium confidence arises from large uncertainties in the estimated non-fossil fuel CO2 fluxes over these regions due to the lack of high-quality atmospheric measurements."
wg1_ch05_5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The surface ocean has absorbed a quarter of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, mainly through physical–chemical processes (McKinley et al., 2016; Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Once dissolved in seawater, CO2 reacts with water and forms carbonic acid, which in turn dissociates, leading to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate (CO3–2) ions, and increasing both bicarbonate (HCO3–) and hydrogen (H+) ion concentration. This process has caused a shift in the carbonate chemistry towards a less basic state, commonly referred to as ‘ocean acidification’ (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Orr et al., 2005; Doney et al., 2009). Although the societal concern regarding ocean acidification is relatively recent (about the last 20 years), the physical–chemical basis for the ocean absorption (sink) of atmospheric CO2 has been discussed much earlier by Revelle and Suess (1957). The AR5 and SROCC assessments were of robust evidence that the H+ion concentration is increasing in the surface ocean, thereby reducing seawater pH (= -log [H+]) (Section 2.3.4.1; Orr et al., 2005; Feely et al., 2009; Ciais et al., 2013; Bindoff et al., 2019), and there is  high confidence that ocean acidification is impacting marine organisms (Bindoff et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Ocean oxygen decline, or deoxygenation, is driven by changes in ocean ventilation and solubility (Bindoff et al., 2019). It is virtually certain that anthropogenic forcing has made a substantial contribution to the ocean heat content increase over the historical period (Bindoff et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c; Chapter 9, Section 2.3.3.1), strengthening upper water column stratification. Ocean warming decreases the solubility of dissolved oxygen in seawater, and it contributes to about 15% of the dissolved oxygen decrease in the oceans according to estimates based on solubility and the recent SROCC assessment (medium confidence), especially in sub-surface waters, between 100–600 m depth (Helm et al., 2011; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018; Oschlies et al., 2018; SROCC, Section 5.3.1). Stratification reduces the ventilation flux into the ocean interior, contributing to most of the remaining ocean deoxygenation (Schmidtko et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018; Section 3.6.2). Deoxygenation may enhance emissions of nitrous oxide, especially from oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) or hypoxic coastal areas (Breitburg et al., 2018; Oschlies et al., 2018). Since SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019), CMIP6 model simulation results agree with the reported 2% loss (4.8 ± 2.1 Pmoles O2) in total dissolved oxygen in the upper ocean layer (100–600 m) for the 1970–2010 period (Helm et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020; Section 2.3.4.2). The response of marine organisms to the coupled effects of ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation occur at different metabolic levels on different groups, and include respiratory stress and reduction of thermal tolerance (Gruber, 2011; Bindoff et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c; Kawahata et al., 2019). An assessment of these effects on marine biota is found in WGII AR6 Chapter 2."

The PETM involved a large pulse of geologic CO2 released into the ocean–atmosphere system in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner, 2018; Gingerich, 2019; Section 5.2.1.1). In response, observationally constrained model simulations report an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations ranging from about 900 ppm to >2000 ppm (Chapter 2; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Cui and Schubert, 2018; Anagnostou et al., 2020). The PETM thus provides a test for our understanding of the ocean’s response to the increase in carbon (and heat) emissions over geologically short time scales."
wg1_ch05_5.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"A limited number of independent proxy records indicate that the PETM was associated with a surface ocean pH decline ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Penman et al., 2014; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018). It was also accompanied by a rapid (<10 ka) shallowing of the carbonate saturation horizon, resulting in the widespread dissolution of sedimentary carbonate, followed by a gradual (100 kyr) recovery (Zachos et al., 2005; Bralower et al., 2018). The remarkable similarity among sedimentary records spanning a wide range of ecosystems suggests with medium confidence that the perturbation in the ocean carbonate saturation was global (Babila et al., 2018) and directly resulted from elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. The degree of acidification is similar to the 0.4 pH unit decrease projected for the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (Gattuso et al., 2015) and is estimated to have occurred at a rate about one order of magnitude slower than the current rate of ocean acidification (Zeebe et al., 2016).

Deoxygenation affected the surface ocean globally (including the Arctic Ocean; Sluijs et al., 2006), due to vertical and lateral expansion of OMZs (Zhou et al., 2014) that resulted from warming and related changes in ocean stratification. Expansion of OMZs may have stimulated N2O production through water-column (de)nitrification (Junium et al., 2018).

Intermediate depths lost oxygen as a result of sluggish ventilation and increasing temperatures (decreasing saturation). As the world emerged from the last Glacial period, OMZs underwent a large volumetric increase at the beginning of the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), a northern-hemisphere wide warming event, 14.7 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Praetorius et al., 2015) with deleterious consequences for benthic ecosystems (e.g., Moffitt et al., 2015). These observations indicate with  high confidence that the rate of warming, affecting the solubility of oxygen and upper water column stratification, coupled with changes in subsurface ocean ventilation, impose a direct control on the degree of ocean deoxygenation, implying a high sensitivity of ocean oxygen loss to warming. The expansion of OMZs contributed to a widespread increase in water column (de)nitrification (Galbraith and Kienast, 2013), which contributed substantially to enhanced marine N2O emissions. Nitrogen stable isotope measurements on N2O extracted from ice cores suggest that approximately one-third (of the order of 0.7 ± 0.3TgN yr–1) of thedeglacial increase in N2O emissions relates to oceanic sources (Schilt et al., 2014; H.

Decadal variations in the South China Sea pH changes of 0.10–0.20 have also been associated with the variation in the East Asian monsoon (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015), as a weakening of the Asian winter monsoon leads to sluggish water circulation within the reefs, building up localised CO2 concentration in the water due to calcification and respiration."

Accordingly, the saturation state Ω (=[Ca2+][CO32-]/Ksp) of seawater with respect to calcium carbonate mineral aragonite has been declining at rates ranging from –0.07 to –0.12 per decade (González-Dávila et al., 2010; Feely et al., 2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2014; Ono et al., 2019; Bates and Johnson, 2020; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3). These rates are consistent with the rates expected from the transient equilibration with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but the variability of rate in decadal time scale has also been detected with robust evidence (Ono et al., 2019; Bates and Johnson, 2020). In the tropical Pacific, its central and eastern upwelling zones exhibited a faster pH decline of –0.022 to –0.026 pH unit per decade due to increased upwelling of CO2 -rich sub-surface waters in addition to anthropogenic CO2 uptake (Sutton et al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015).

Observational and modelling studies (Nakano et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020) consistently suggest that slower acidification in this region is attributable to the anthropogenic CO2 taken up in the extratropics around a decade ago and transported to the tropics via shallow meridional overturning circulations."

In the Arctic Ocean, a temporally limited time series of carbonate chemistry measurements prevents drawing robust conclusions on ocean acidification trends. However, the carbonate saturation state (Ω) is generally low, and observational studies show with robust evidence that the recent extensive melting of sea ice leading to enhanced air–sea CO2 exchange, large freshwater inputs, together with river discharge and glacial drainage, as well as the degradation of terrestrial organic matter in seawater, result in the decline of Ω of aragonite to undersaturation (Bates et al., 2009; Chierici and Fransson, 2009; Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010; Robbins et al., 2013; Fransson et al., 2015; Semiletov et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017; Beaupré-Laperrière et al., 2020; Y.

The net change in oxygen consumption by aerobic respiration of marine organisms further influences acidification by releasing CO2 (Section 5.3.3.2; Chen et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018; Robinson, 2019)."

The regions of deep convection such as subpolar North Atlantic and Southern Ocean present the deepest acidification detections below 2000 m (medium confidence). Mid-latitudinal zones within the subtropical cells and tropical regions present a relatively deep and shallow detection, respectively. A pH decrease has also been observed on the Antarctic continental shelf (Hauck et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2015). Acidification is also underway in the subsurface to intermediate layers of the Arctic Ocean due to the inflow of ventilated waters from the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (Qi et al., 2017; Ulfsbo et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch05_5.3.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"A significant increase in acidification resulting from net metabolic CO2 release coupled with ocean circulation changes has been shown with  high confidence in large swathes of intermediate waters in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (Dore et al., 2009; Byrne et al., 2010; Ríos et al., 2015; Chu et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2017; Lauvset et al., 2020). For example, ocean circulation contributes a pH change of –0.013 ± 0.013 to the overall observed change of –0.029 ± 0.014 for 1993–2013 at depths around 1000 m at 30°S–40°S in the South Atlantic ocean (Ríos et al., 2015). Long-term repeated observations in the North Pacific show a decline in dissolved oxygen (–4.0 μmol kg−1 per decade at maximum) being sustained in the intermediate water since the 1980s (Takatani et al., 2012; Sasano et al., 2015). The amplification of acidification associated with the weakening ventilation is thought to have been occurring persistently. In contrast, for the North Pacific subtropical mode water, large decadal variability in pH and aragonite saturation state with amplitudes of about 0.02 and about 0.1, respectively, are superimposed on secular declining trends due to anthropogenic CO2 invasion (Oka et al., 2019). This is associated with the variability in ventilation due to the approximately 50% variation in the formation volume of the mode water that is forced remotely by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Qiu et al., 2013; Oka et al., 2015)."

In contrast, shoaling rates of 4 m yr–1 to 1710 m for 1984–2008 and of 10–15 m yr–1 to 2250 m for 1991–2016 have been observed in the Iceland sea and the Irminger sea, respectively (Olafsson et al., 2009; Pérez et al., 2018)."

Its rates at depths are controlled by the ventilation of the ocean interior as well as anthropogenic CO2 uptake at the surface, thereby diminishing with depth (very high confidence) (Figure 5.21). Variability in ocean circulation modulates the trend of ocean acidification at depths through the changes in ventilation and their impacts on metabolic CO2 content. However, the large knowledge gap around ventilation changes leads to low confidence in their impacts in many ocean regions (Sections 5.3.3.2; 9.2.2.3 and 9.3.2)."
wg1_ch05_5.3.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"As summarized in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4), there is a growing consensus that between 1970 and 2010 the open ocean has very likely lost 0.5–3.3% of its dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000 m depth (Section 2.3.3.6; Helm et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019). Regionally, the equatorial and North Pacific, the Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic have shown the greatest oxygen loss of up to 30 mol m–2 per decade (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Warming – via solubility reduction and circulation changes – mixing and respiration are considered the major drivers, with 50% of the oxygen loss for the upper 1000 m of the global oceans attributable to the solubility reduction (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Climate variability also modifies the oxygen loss on interannual and decadal time scales especially for the tropical ocean OMZs (Deutsch et al., 2011, 2014; Llanillo et al., 2013) and the North Pacific subarctic zone (Whitney et al., 2007; Sasano et al., 2018; Cummins and Ross, 2020). However, quantifying the oxygen decline and variability and attributing them to processes in different regions remains challenging (Levin, 2018; Oschlies et al., 2018). Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP5 and CMIP6 corroborate the decline in ocean oxygen, and project a continuing and accelerating decline with a strong impact of natural climate variability under high-emissions scenarios (Bopp et al., 2013; Long et al., 2016; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). However, CMIP5 models did not reproduce observed patterns for oxygen changes in the tropical thermocline, and generally simulated only about half the oxygen loss inferred from observations (Oschlies et al., 2018). CMIP6 models have a more realistic simulated mean state of ocean biogeochemistry than CMIP5 models due to improved ocean physical processes and better representation of biogeochemical processes (Séférian et al., 2020). Theyalso exhibit enhanced ocean warming as a result of an increase in the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 models, which contributes to increased stratification and reduced subsurface ventilation (Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.4, 5.3.3.2, 7.4.2, 7.5.6, 9.2.1, and TS2.4). Consequently, CMIP6 model ensembles reproduce the ocean deoxygenation trend of −0.30 to −1.52 mmol m−3 per decade between 1970–2010 reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4) with a verylikely range, and also project 32–71% greater subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen decline relative to their Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) analogues in CMIP5, reaching to the likely range of decline of 6.4 ± 2.9 mmol m–3under SSP1–2.6 and 13.3 ± 5.3 mmol m–3under SSP5–8.5, from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). It is concluded that the oxygen content of subsurface ocean is projected to transition to historically unprecedented condition with decline over the 21st century (medium confidence)."
wg1_ch05_5.3.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"In oxygen-depleted waters, microbial processes (denitrification and anammox, i.e., anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Kuypers et al., 2005; Codispoti, 2007; Gruber and Galloway, 2008) remove fixed nitrogen, and when upwelled waters reach the photic zone, primary production becomes nitrogen-limited (Tyrrell and Lucas, 2002). However, in other oceanic regions, increased water-column stratification due to warming may reduce the amount of N2O reaching the surface and thereby decrease N2O flux to the atmosphere. Landolfi et al. (2017) suggest that, by 2100, under the RCP8.5 scenario, total N2O production in the ocean may decline by 5% and N2O emissions be reduced by 24% relative to the pre-industrial era due to decreased organic matter export and anthropogenic-driven changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric N2O concentrations. Projected oxygen loss in the ocean is thought to result in an ocean-climate feedback through changes in the natural emissions of GHGs (low confidence)."
wg1_ch05_5.3.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The areas with relatively rapid oxygen decrease include OMZs in the tropical oceans, where oxygen content has been decreasing at a rate of 0.9–3.4 µmol kg–1 per decade in the thermocline for the past five decades (Stramma et al., 2008). Low oxygen, low pH and shallow aragonite saturation horizons in the OMZs of the eastern boundary upwelling regions co-occur, affecting ecosystem structure (Chavez et al., 2008) and function in the water column, including the presently unbalanced nitrogen cycle (Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009). The coupling between upwelling, productivity, and oxygen depletion feeds back to biological productivity and the role of these regions as sinks or sources of climate active gases. When OMZ waters upwell and impinge on the euphotic zone, they release significant quantities of GHGs, including N2O (0.81–1.35 TgN yr–1), CH4 (0.27–0.38 TgCH4yr–1), and CO2 (yet to be quantified) to the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming (Paulmier et al., 2008; Naqvi et al., 2010; Kock et al., 2012; Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015; Farías et al., 2015). Modelling projectionssuggest a global decrease of 4–12% in oceanic N2O emissions (from 3.71–4.03 TgN yr–1 to 3.54–3.56 TgN yr–1) from 2005 to 2100 under RCP8.5, despite a tendency to increased N2O production in the OMZs, associated primarily with denitrification (Martinez-Rey et al., 2015). It is difficult to single out the contribution of nitrification and denitrification, which can occur simultaneously. A rigorous separation of these two processes would require more mechanistic parametrization, which has been hindered by the still large conceptual and parametric uncertainties (Babbin et al., 2015; Trimmer et al., 2016; Landolfi et al., 2017). Furthermore, the correlation between N2O and oxygen varies with microorganisms present, nutrient concentrations, and other environmental variables (Voss et al., 2013)."

However, there is low confidence in the reduction in N2O emissions to the atmosphere, because of large conceptual and parametric uncertainties, a limited number of modelling studies that explored this process, and greater oxygen losses simulated in CMIP6 models than in CMIP5 models (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020)."

They also projected faster pH declines in mode waters below seasonal mixed layers (Resplandy et al., 2013; Watanabe and Kawamiya, 2017) as has been observed in the Atlantic (Salt et al., 2015) and in the Pacific (Carter et al., 2019), because of the net CO2 release by respiration and lowering CO2 buffering capacity of seawater. In these CO2 concentration-driven simulations, the level of acidification in the surface ocean is primarily determined by atmospheric CO2 concentration and regional seawater carbonate chemistry, thereby providing consistent projections across models. New projections with CMIP6 ESMs show greater surface pH decline of –0.16 ± 0.002 under the SSP1-2.6 and –0.44 ± 0.005 under SSP5-8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 (Section 4.3.2.5 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The greater pH declines in CMIP6 are primarily a consequence of higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations in SSPs than their CMIP5-RCP analogues (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Ocean acidification is also projected to occur with  high confidence in the Abyssal Bottom Waters in regions such as the northern North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean (Sulpis et al., 2019), with the rates of global mean pH decline of –0.018 ± 0.001 under SSP1-2.6 and –0.030 ± 0.002 under SSP5-8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 in CMIP6 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020)."

The simultaneous amplification of [H+] and attenuation of pH seasonal cycles is counterintuitive but is the consequence of a greater increase in the annual mean [H+] due to anthropogenic CO2 invasion than the corresponding increase in its seasonal amplitude. These changes are consistent with the amplification/attenuation of the seasonal variation of +81 ±16% for [H+] and –16 ± 7% for pH from 1990–1999 to 2090–2099 under RCP8.5 in CMIP5 (Kwiatkowski and Orr, 2018)."
wg1_ch05_5.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The signal of ocean acidification in surface ocean is large and is projected to emerge beyond the range of natural variability within the time scale of a decade in all ocean basins (Schlunegger et al., 2019). There is  high agreement among modelling studies that the largest pH decline and large-scale undersaturation of aragonite in surface seawater start to occur first in polar oceans (Orr et al., 2005; Steinacher et al., 2009; Hurd et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). Under SSP5-8.5, the largest surface pH decline, exceeding 0.45 between 1995–2014 and 2080–2099, occurs in the Arctic Ocean (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The freshwater input from sea ice melt is an additional factor leading to a faster decline of aragonite saturation level than expected from the anthropogenic CO2 uptake (Yamamoto et al., 2012). The increase in riverine and glacial discharges that provide terrigenous carbon, nutrients and alkalinity as well as freshwater are the other factors modifying the rate of acidification in the Arctic Ocean. However, their impacts have been projected in a limited number of studies with extensive knowledge gaps and model simplifications leading to low confidence in their impacts (Terhaar et al., 2019; Hopwood et al., 2020). In the Southern Ocean, the aragonite undersaturation starts in the 2030s in RCP8.5, and the area that experiences aragonite undersaturation for at least one month per year by 2100 is projected to be more than 95%. Under RCP2.6, short periods (less than one month) of aragonite undersaturation are expected to be found in less than 2% of the area during this century (Sasse et al., 2015; Hauri et al., 2016; Negrete-García et al., 2019). These long term projections are modified at interannual time scales by large-scale climate modes (Ríos et al., 2015) such as the ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (Conrad and Lovenduski, 2015). In other regions, acidification trends are influenced by a range of processes such as changes in ocean circulation, temperature, salinity, carbon cycling, and the structure of the marine ecosystem. As, at present, models do not resolve fine-scale variability of these processes, current projections do not fully capture the changes that the marine environment will experience in the future (Takeshita et al., 2015; Turi et al., 2016)."

However, the magnitude and sign (direction) of many of ocean carbon–climate feedbacks are still poorly constrained (Matear and Lenton, 2014, 2018), leading to low confidence in their significant and long-lasting impacts on ocean acidification."
wg1_ch05_5.3.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Reversing the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations through negative emissions (Section 5.6) will reverse ocean acidification at the sea surface (high confidence) but will not result in rapid amelioration of ocean acidification in the deeper ocean (Section 5.3.3.2).

However, because of the long time scales of the ocean turnover that transfers CO2 from the upper to the deep ocean, excess carbon will continue to accumulate in the deep ocean even after a decrease in atmospheric CO2 (Cao et al., 2014; Mathesius et al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; T.

These areas, according to SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) are, with  high confidence, already affected by ocean acidification and deoxygenation. This section assesses the drivers and spatial variability of acidification and deoxygenation based on new observations and data products."

Sun et al., 2020) confirm the strong spatial and temporal variability in the coastal ocean surface carbonate chemistry and sea-air CO2 fluxes (high agreement, robust evidence). The anthropogenic CO2 -induced acidification is either mitigated or enhanced through biological processes; primary production removes dissolved CO2 from the surface, and respiration adds CO2 and consumes oxygen in the subsurface layers. The relative intensity of these processes is controlled by natural or anthropogenic eutrophication. Other drivers of variability include biological community composition, freshwater input from rivers or melting ice, sea ice cover and calcium carbonate precipitation/dissolution dynamics, coastal upwelling and regional circulation, and seasonal surface cooling (Fransson et al., 2015, 2017; Feely et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; Hauri et al., 2020; Monteiro et al., 2020b; H. Sun et al., 2020). Near-shore surface waters are often supersaturated with CO2, regardless of the latitude, especially in highly populated areas receiving substantial amounts of domestic and industrial sewage (Chen and Borges, 2009). Nevertheless, thermal or haline-stratified eutrophic coastal areas may act as net atmospheric CO2 sinks (Chou et al., 2013; Cotovicz Jr. et al., 2015). Continental shelves, excluding near-shore areas, act as CO2 sinks at a rate of 0.2 ± 0.02 PgC yr–1 (Laruelle et al., 2014; Roobaert et al., 2019), considering ice-free areas only.

Increasing intensity and frequency of wind-driven upwelling is responsible for longer and more intense coastal hypoxia, fuelled by organic matter degradation from primary production(medium to high agreement, medium evidence) (Rabalais et al., 2010; Bakun et al., 2015; Varela et al., 2015; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Limburg et al., 2020). Locally, submarine groundwater discharge may enhance the eutrophication state (low agreement, limited evidence, Luijendijk et al., 2020). Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) and SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) new observations and model studies confirm the trends in increasing coastal hypoxia caused by eutrophication, ocean warming and changes in circulation (Claret et al., 2018; Dussin et al., 2019; Limburg et al., 2020), as well as the ubiquitous impacts on marine organisms and fisheries (AR6 WGII Chapter 3; Carstensen and Conley, 2019; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Osma et al., 2020). Following open ocean deoxygenation trends since the 1950s, more than 700 coastal regions are being reported as hypoxic (dissolved oxygen concentration <2 mg O2L–1) (Limburg et al., 2020). Additionally, deoxygenation or increasing severe hypoxic periods in coastal areas may enhance the sea-to-air fluxes of N2O and CH4 especially through microbial-mediated processes in the water column–sediment interface (medium agreement) (Middelburg and Levin, 2009; Naqvi et al., 2010; Farías et al., 2015; Limburg et al., 2020)."

Low alkalinity and total inorganic carbon concentration, combined with an ocean signal of acidification, diminishes the buffering capacity along the decreasing salinity gradient from the ocean to the coast.

Sun et al., 2020) confirm the strong spatial and temporal variability in the coastal ocean surface carbonate chemistry and sea-air CO2 fluxes (high agreement, robust evidence). The anthropogenic CO2 -induced acidification is either mitigated or enhanced through biological processes; primary production removes dissolved CO2 from the surface, and respiration adds CO2 and consumes oxygen in the subsurface layers. The relative intensity of these processes is controlled by natural or anthropogenic eutrophication. Other drivers of variability include biological community composition, freshwater input from rivers or melting ice, sea ice cover and calcium carbonate precipitation/dissolution dynamics, coastal upwelling and regional circulation, and seasonal surface cooling (Fransson et al., 2015, 2017; Feely et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; Hauri et al., 2020; Monteiro et al., 2020b; H.

Near-shore surface waters are often supersaturated with CO2, regardless of the latitude, especially in highly populated areas receiving substantial amounts of domestic and industrial sewage (Chen and Borges, 2009). Nevertheless, thermal or haline-stratified eutrophic coastal areas may act as net atmospheric CO2 sinks (Chou et al., 2013; Cotovicz Jr. et al., 2015). Continental shelves, excluding near-shore areas, act as CO2 sinks at a rate of 0.2 ± 0.02 PgC yr–1 (Laruelle et al., 2014; Roobaert et al., 2019), considering ice-free areas only.

This effect is represented in all ESMs. New studies since AR5 add evidence that the leaf-level CO2 fertilization is modulated by acclimation of photosynthesis to long-term CO2 exposure, growth temperature, seasonal drought, and nutrient availability, but these effects are not yet routinely represented in ESMs (Smith and Dukes, 2013; Baig et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2016; Drake et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020a). Cross-Chapter Box 5.1 assesses multiple lines of evidence, which suggest that the ratio of plant CO2 uptake to water loss – plant water-use efficiency (WUE) – increases in near proportionality to atmospheric CO2. Despite advances in the regional coverage of field experiments, observations of the consequences of CO2 fertilization at ecosystem level are still scarce, in particular from outside the temperate zone (Song et al., 2019). New syntheses since AR5 corroborate that the effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth and ecosystem carbon storage is generally positive (high confidence), but is modulated by temperature, water and nutrient availability (Reich et al., 2014; Obermeier et al., 2017; Peñuelas et al., 2017; Hovenden et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019). Plant carbon allocation, changes in plant community composition, disturbance, and natural plant mortality are important processes affecting the magnitude of the response, but are currently poorly represented in models (De Kauwe et al., 2014; Friend et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2018; A.P. Walker et al., 2019; K. Yu et al., 2019), and thus contribute strongly to uncertainty in ESM projections (Arora et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Field studies with elevated CO2 have demonstrated that the initial stimulation of above-ground growth may decline if insufficient nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus are available (Finzi et al., 2007; Norby et al., 2010; Hungate et al., 2013; Reich and Hobbie, 2013; Talhelm et al., 2014; Terrer et al., 2018). Model-data syntheses have demonstrated that capturing the observed long-term effect of elevated CO2 depends on the ability of models to predict the effect of vegetation on soil biogeochemistry (Zaehle et al., 2014; Koven et al., 2015b; Medlyn et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015). Meta-analyses of CO2 manipulation experiments point to increased soil microbial activity and accelerated turnover of soil organic matter (van Groenigen et al., 2017) as a result of increased below-ground carbon allocation by plants (Song et al., 2019), and increased root exudation or mycorrhizal activity due to enhanced plant nutrient requirements under elevated CO2 (Drake et al., 2011; Terrer et al., 2016; Meier et al., 2017). These effects are not considered in most ESMs. One global model that attempts to represent these processes suggests that elevated CO2 -related carbon accumulation is reduced in soils but increased in vegetation relative to more conventional models (Sulman et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Our understanding of the effects of phosphorus limitation is less developed than for nitrogen, but a growing body of literature suggests that it is just as important, particularly in regions with highly weathered soils (Wang et al., 2018; Terrer et al., 2019; Du et al., 2020). CO2 experiments collectively show that soil phosphorus is an important constraint on the CO2 fertilization effect on plant biomass (Terrer et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020a). For example, despite increases in photosynthesis after four years of CO2 exposure, a free-air CO2 enrichment experiment in a phosphorus-limited mature forest ecosystem did not find an increase in biomass production (Jiang et al., 2020b). The lack of free-air CO2 enrichment experiments in phosphorus-limited tropical forests limits our understanding of the role of phosphorus availability in constraining the CO2 fertilization effect globally (Norby et al., 2016; Fleischer et al., 2019). Models accounting for the effects of phosphorus availability, in addition to nitrogen, generally show an even stronger reduction of the response of ecosystem carbon storage to elevated CO2 (Goll et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014; X. Yang et al., 2019). Insufficient data and uncertainties in the process formulation cause large uncertainty in the magnitude of this effect (Medlyn et al., 2016; Fleischer et al., 2019)."

In the CMIP6 ensemble, the increase of land carbon storage due to CO2 fertilization is a global phenomenon but is strongest in the tropics (Figure 5.26). The resulting increase of productivity is a key driver of increases in vegetation and soil carbon storage. However, consistent with earlier findings (Todd-Brown et al., 2013; Friend et al., 2014; Hajima et al., 2014), processes affecting vegetation carbon-use efficiency and turnover, such as allocation changes, mortality, and vegetation structural changes, as well as the pre-industrial soil carbon turnover time, also play an important role (Arora et al., 2020)."

On average, these models exhibit a 25–30% lower CO2 fertilization effect on land carbon storage, compared to models that do not account for nitrogen cycle dynamics (Figure 5.29 and Table 5.5). The only model in the C4MIP-CMIP6 ensemble that explicitly represents the effect of P availability on plant growth suggests the lowest carbon storage response to increasing CO2 (Arora et al., 2020). The lower CO2 effect due to decreased nutrient availability is generally consistent with analyses of the implicit nutrient limitation in CMIP5 simulations (Wieder et al., 2015; Zaehle et al., 2015) and independent assessments by stand-alone land models (Zaehle et al., 2010; Wårlind et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Goll et al., 2017; Meyerholt et al., 2020). The simulated effects are generally consistent with expectations based on independent observations (Walker et al., 2021). However, the magnitude of nutrient feedbacks in these models is poorly constrained by observations, owing to the limited geographic distribution of available observations and the uncertain scaling of results obtained from manipulation experiments to transient system dynamics (Song et al., 2019; Wieder et al., 2019; Meyerholt et al., 2020)."

Since AR5 (WGI, Box 6.2), an increasing number of CMIP6 ESMs account for nutrient cycles. The consistent results found in their model projections suggests with  high confidence that limited nutrient availability will limit the CO2 fertilization effect (Arora et al., 2020).

The analysis from emissions and concentration-driven CMIP5 model projections show that the ocean sink stops growing beyond 2050 across all emissions scenarios (Section 5.4.5.3).

The detailed understanding of carbonate chemistry in seawater that has accumulated over more than half a century (e.g., Revelle and Suess, 1957; Egleston et al., 2010), provides  high confidence that the excess CO2 dissolved in seawater leads to a non-linear reduction of the CO2 buffering capacity, that is smaller dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increase with respect to pCO2 increase along with the increase in cumulative ocean CO2 uptake. Recent studies (Katavouta et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020) suggest with medium confidence that the decrease in the ocean CO2 uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, under low to no mitigation scenarios over the 21st century, is predominantly attributable to the ocean carbon-concentration feedback through the reduction of the seawater CO2 buffering capacity, but with contributions from physical drivers such as warming and wind stress (medium confidence) and biological drivers (low confidence) (Sections 5.2.1.3.3 and 5.4.4)."

Using natural gradients of soil carbon turnover as a constraint on long-term responses to warming suggests that both CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs may systematically underestimate the temperature sensitivity at high latitudes, and may overestimate the temperature sensitivity in the tropics (Koven et al., 2017; Wieder et al., 2018; Varney et al., 2020), although experimental soil warming in tropical forests suggest high sensitivity of decomposition to warming in those regions as well (Nottingham et al., 2020)."

The remaining 280–340 PgC are in permafrost-free soils within the permafrost region. These carbon deposits have accumulated over thousands of years due to the slow rates of organic matter decomposition in frozen and/or waterlogged soil layers, but these frozen soils are highly decomposable upon thaw (Schädel et al., 2014)."

The Special Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climte (SROCC) assessed with  high confidence that ecosystems in the permafrost region act as carbon sinks during the summer growing season, and that wintertime carbon losses are significant, consistent with a multi-decadal small increase in CO2 emissions during early winter at Barrow, Alaska (Sweeney et al., 2016; Webb et al., 2016; Meredith et al., 2019). These findings have been further strengthened by recent comprehensive synthesis of in-situ wintertime flux observations that show large carbon losses during the non-growing season (Natali et al., 2019). Increased autumn and winter respiration are a key large-scale fingerprint of top-down permafrost thaw predicted by ecosystem models (Parazoo et al., 2018). However, the length of these wintertime observational records is too short to unequivocally determine whether winter carbon losses are higher now than they used to be. One study inferred a multi-year net CO2 source for the tundra in Alaska (Commane et al., 2017), which is equivalent to 0.3 PgC yr–1 when scaled up to the northern permafrost region (low confidence) (Meredith et al., 2019)."

Estimates of CO2 fluxes with atmospheric inversion models showed an enhanced seasonal cycle amplitude but no significant trends in annual total fluxes, in agreement with flux tower measurements over one decade (2004–2013) (Welp et al., 2016; Takata et al., 2017)."

These include observed regional lake area change, which suggest a 1.6–5 Tg CH4yr–1 increase over the last 50 years (Walter Anthony et al., 2016), ice-capped geological sources (Walter Anthony et al., 2012; Kohnert et al., 2017), and shallow Arctic Ocean shelves. The shallow subsea emissions are particularly uncertain due to the wide range of estimates (3 Tg CH4yr–1 (Thornton et al., 2016b) to 17 Tg CH4yr–1 (Shakhova et al., 2014)), and the lack of a baseline with which to infer any changes; however, the upper half of this range in flux estimates is inconsistent with the atmospheric inversions constrained by the pan-Arctic CH4 concentration measurements (Berchet et al., 2016)."

Mass-balance calculations reveal that geological CH4 emissions have not exceeded 19 Tg yr–1, highlighting that the deglacial increase in CH4 emissions was predominantly related to contemporary CH4 emissions from tropical wetlands and seasonally inundated floodplains (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). Isotopic constraints on CO2 losses from permafrost with warming after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are weaker than for CH4. While the biosphere as a whole held less carbon during the LGM than the pre-industrial, that change in stocks was smaller than the change in plant productivity, and so carbon losses at high latitudes may have been offset by increased tropical productivity in response to warming during the Last Deglacial Transition (LDT; Ciais et al., 2012). There is also paleoclimate evidence for processes that mitigate carbon losses with warming on longer time scales, such as longer-term carbon accumulation in lake deposits following thermokarst thaw (Walter Anthony et al., 2014), and long-term accumulation of carbon in permafrost soils following LDT carbon loss (Lindgren et al., 2018), particularly in peatlands which accumulated carbon at a slow but persistent rate in warm paleoclimates (Treat et al., 2019)."

Abrupt thaw processes include ice-wedge polygon degradation, hillslope collapse, thermokarst lake expansion and draining, all of which are processes largely occurring in regions with very high soil carbon content (Olefeldt et al., 2016a, b). Abrupt thaw processes can contribute up to half of the total net greenhouse gas release from permafrost loss, the rest attributed to gradual thaw (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Turetsky et al., 2020). Increased fire frequency and severity (Hu et al., 2010) also contributes to abrupt emissions and the removal of the insulating cover which leads to an acceleration of permafrost thaw (Genet et al., 2013). Ecological feedbacks can both mitigate and amplify carbon losses: nutrient release from increased organic matter decomposition can drive vegetation growth that partially offsets soil carbon losses (Salmon et al., 2016), but also lead to biophysical feedbacks that further amplify warming (Myers-Smith et al., 2011)."
wg1_ch05_box-5.1_p19,NO_TITLE,"Through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), Earth system models (ESMs) had not included permafrost carbon dynamics. This remains largely true in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), with most models not representing permafrost carbon processes, a small number representing the active-layer thickening effect on decomposition (Table 5.4), and no ESMs representing thermokarst or fire-permafrost-carbon interactions. The CMIP6 ensemble mean predicts a negative carbon–climate feedback in the permafrost region. However, those that do include permafrost carbon show a positive carbon–climate feedback in the permafrost region (Figure 5.27). Given the current limited ESM capacity to assess permafrost feedbacks, estimates in this report are based on published permafrost-enabled land surface model results."

Under lower emissions scenarios, Schneider von Deimling et al.

The assessment is based on a wide range of scenarios evaluated at 2100, and an assessed estimate of the permafrost CH4-climate feedback at 2.8 [0.7 to 7.3] PgCeq °C–1 (Figure 5.29).

Schneider von Deimling et al.

The multi-model ensemble (McGuire et al., 2018) projects a much wider range of permafrost soil carbon losses of 81–642 PgC (mean 314 PgC) for an RCP8.5 scenario from 2100 to 2300, and of a gain of 14 PgC to a loss of 54 PgC (mean loss of 17 PgC) for an RCP4.5 scenario over the same period."

It alsoremains unclear whether the permafrost carbon pool represents a coherent global tipping element of the Earth system with a single abrupt threshold (Drijfhout et al., 2015) at a given level of global warming, or a local scale tipping point without abrupt thresholds when aggregated across the pan-Arctic region, as is suggested by recent model results (e.g., Koven et al., 2015a; McGuire et al., 2018)."

It is projected that CO2 released from permafrost will be 18 (3.1–41) PgC °C–1by 2100, with the relative contribution of CO2 vs CH4 remaining poorly constrained. Permafrost carbon feedbacks are included among the under-represented feedbacks quantified in Figure 5.29."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The principal contribution to increasing global ocean carbon is the air–sea flux of CO2, which changes the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) inventory (Section 5.4.2; Arora et al., 2020). The processes that influence the variability and trends of the ocean carbon–heat nexus are assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 5.3. Climate has three important impacts on the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 : (i) ocean warming reduces the solubility of CO2, which increases pCO2 and increases the stratification of the mixed layer, both acting as positive feedbacks weakening the ocean sink (Section 9.2.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; Arora et al., 2020); (ii) changing the temporal and spatial characteristics of wind stress and storms alters mixing – entrainment in, and across the bottom of, the mixed layer (Bronselaer et al., 2018); and (iii) warming and wind stress influence the large-scale meridional overturning circulation (MOC) circulation, which modifies the rate of ventilation, storage or outgassing of ocean carbon in the ocean interior (Section 5.2.3.1; Gruber et al., 2019b; Arora et al., 2020). The land-to-ocean riverine flux and the carbon burial in ocean sediments play a minor role (low confidence) (Arora et al., 2020). Based on high agreement of projections by coupled climate models, there is  high confidence that the resultant climate–carbon cycle feedbacks are positive, but the extent of the ocean sink weakening is scenario dependent (Arora et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Regionally, the Southern Ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO2 (Figure 5.8a), although challenges in modelling its circulation and Antarctic sea ice transport (Sections 3.4.1.2, 9.2.3.2 and 9.3.2) generate uncertainty in the response of its sink to future carbon–climate feedbacks. Increased freshwater input may cause a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to increased Southern Ocean biological carbon storage (Ito et al., 2015); alternatively, increased winds may intensify the overturning circulation, reducing the net CO2 sink in the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2018). On centennial time scales, there is thus low confidence in the overall effect of intensifying winds in the Southern Ocean on CO2 uptake."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"While physical drivers control the present-day anthropogenic carbon sink, biological processes are responsible for the majority of the vertical gradient in DIC (natural carbon storage). A small fraction of the organic carbon fixed by primary production (PP) reaches the sea floor, where it can be stored in sediments on geological time scales, making the biological carbon pump (BCP) an important mechanism for very long-term CO2 storage. Projected reductions in ocean ventilation (Section 9.2.1.4) would lengthen residence time and lead to DIC accumulating in the deep ocean due to organic carbon remineralization."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 (Section 6.3.2.5.6), progress has been made in understanding the biological drivers of ocean carbon uptake in both coupled climate models and observations (SROCC, Section 5.2.2.6). Here we focus on potential feedbacks between biological processes and climate. In CMIP5 models, the direction of modelled PP in response to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate warming wasunclear (Taucher and Oschlies, 2011; Laufkötter et al., 2015). This remains the case in the CMIP6 models; inter-model uncertainty has increased in CMIP6 models, compared to CMIP5. The projected global multi-model mean change in PP in 13 models run under the SSP5−8.5 scenario is −3 ± 9% (2080–2099 mean values relative to 1870–1899 ± the inter-model standard deviation; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Under the low-emissions, high-mitigation scenario SSP1−2.6, the global change in PP is −0.56 ± 4%. Observations in the contemporary period provide little direct constraint on the modelled responses of PP to climate change, partly due to insufficiently long records (Henson et al., 2016). However, there is some indication of an emergent constraint on changes in tropical PP based on interannual variability derived from remote sensing (Section 5.4.6; Kwiatkowski et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In CMIP5 models run under RCP8.5, particulate organic carbon (POC) export flux is projected to decline by 1–12% by 2100 (Taucher and Oschlies, 2011; Laufkoetter et al., 2015). Similar values are predicted in 18 CMIP6 models, with declines of 2.5–21.5% (median –14%) or 0.2–2 GtC (median –0.8 GtC) between 1900 and 2100 under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The mechanisms driving these changes vary widely between models due to differences in parametrization of particle formation, remineralization and plankton community structure."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Ocean warming reduces the vertical supply of nutrients to the upper ocean due to increasing stratification (Section 9.2.1.4) but may also act to alleviate seasonal light limitation. The projected effect is to decrease PP at low latitudes and increase PP at high latitudes (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Future changes to dust deposition due to desertification (Mahowald et al., 2017), alterations to the nitrogen cycle (Section 5.3.3.2; SROCC, Section 5.2.3.1.2), and reducing sea ice cover (Ardyna and Arrigo, 2020) all have the potential to alter PP regionally. Higher ocean temperatures tend to result in higher metabolic rates, although respiration may increase more rapidly than PP (Boscolo-Galazzo et al., 2018; Brewer, 2019; Cavan et al., 2019). Ocean warming and reduced PP are expected to result in lower zooplankton abundance, and the expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) may reduce the ability of zooplankton to remineralize POC, thus increasing the efficiency of the BCP and forming a negative climate feedback (Cavan et al., 2017). Increased microbial respiration due to warming may result in greater quantities of organic carbon transferred into the dissolved organic carbon pool (Jiao et al., 2014; Legendre et al., 2015; Roshan and DeVries, 2017) which, while increasing the residence time of carbon in the ocean, would ultimately reduce the sedimentary burial, and hence sequestration on geologic time scales (Olivarez Lyle and Lyle, 2006)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Most models project that smaller phytoplankton are favoured in future ocean conditions (medium confidence; Cabré et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2016; Flombaum et al., 2020) driven by warming water and/or changing nutrient availability, which would alter the magnitude and efficiency of the BCP by altering the sinking speed, respiration rate and aggregation/fragmentation of sinking particles. There is low confidence in the sign of the resulting feedback: regions in which small phytoplankton dominate may have a more efficient pump, although the total amount of organic carbon reaching the sea floor is lower (Herndl and Reinthaler, 2013; Bach et al., 2016; Richardson, 2019). Alternatively, an increase in small phytoplankton could result in a less efficient pump, due either to a greater fraction of PP being processed through the upper ocean microbial loop (Jiao et al., 2014) or generation of slower sinking particles (Guidi et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2021). Variable phytoplankton stoichiometry is predicted to increase the amount of carbon stored via the BCP relative to the amount of PP, so that fixed stoichiometry models (as in CMIP5) may underestimate cumulative ocean carbon uptake to 2100 by 0.5–3.5% (2–15 PgC; RCP8.5 scenario; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Other climate effects such as deoxygenation or ocean acidification could also result in alterations to the magnitude and efficiency of the BCP (Krumhardt et al., 2019; Raven et al., 2021; Taucher et al., 2021)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.4.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Based on high agreement across multiple lines of evidence and physical understanding there is  high confidence that feedbacks to climate will arise from alterations to the magnitude and efficiency of the BCP changing PP, and the depth of remineralization. However, the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the export and remineralization of POC result in low confidence in the magnitude and sign of biological feedbacks to climate. Nevertheless, improved model representation of PP and the BCP is required (which requires better observational constraints), as the contribution of biological processes to CO2 uptake is expected to become more significant with continued climate change (Hauck et al., 2015)."

Model output data from CMIP5 was analysed in AR5, while data from CMIP6 forms the basis for the analysis presented in this subsection. The CMIP5 ESMs discussed in AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2) produced a wide range of projections of future CO2 (Friedlingstein et al., 2014b) primarily associated with different magnitudes of carbon–climate and carbon-concentration feedbacks (Arora et al., 2013), but also exacerbated by differences in the simulation of the net carbon release from land-use change (Brovkin et al., 2013). A key deficiency of almost all CMIP5 ESMs was the neglect of nutrient limitations on CO2-fertilization of land plant photosynthesis (Section 5.4.1; Zaehle et al., 2015)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.5_p3,5.4.5.1 Evaluation of the Contemporary Carbon Cycle in Concentration-driven Runs,"Some CMIP6 models considered in this report now include nitrogen limitations on land vegetation growth, along with many other added processes compared to CMIP5. Table 5.4 summarizes characteristics of the land and ocean carbon cycle models used in CMIP6 ESMs (Arora et al., 2020). In CMIP6, most ocean carbon cycle models (8 of 11) track three or more limiting nutrients (most often nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron), and include two or more phytoplankton types. More than half of the land carbon cycle models (6 of 11) now include an interactive nitrogen cycle, and almost half (5 of 11) represent forest fires. However, even for CMIP6, very few models explicitly represent vegetation dynamics (3 of 11) or permafrost carbon (2 of 11). Despite these remaining limitations, the carbon cycle components of CMIP6 represent an advance on those in CMIP5, as they represent additional important processes (e.g., nitrogen limitations on the land carbon sink, and iron limitations on ocean ecosystems)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.5_p4,5.4.5.1 Evaluation of the Contemporary Carbon Cycle in Concentration-driven Runs,"ESMs can be driven by anthropogenic CO2 emissions (‘emissions-driven’ runs), in which case atmospheric CO2 concentration is a predicted variable; or by prescribed time-varying atmospheric concentrations (‘concentration-driven’ runs). In concentration-driven runs, simulated land and ocean carbon sinks respond to the prescribed atmospheric CO2 and resulting changes in climate, but do not feed back through changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Concentration-driven runs are used to diagnose the carbon emissions consistent with the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and other prescribed concentration scenarios (Section 5.5). In this subsection we specifically analyse results from concentration-driven ESM projections."

This is particularly the case for highly uncertain land carbon cycle feedbacks (Arora et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014b). Land models within ESMs can be compared to multiple different datasets that test different aspects of the models. These include fluxes, such as gross carbon uptake, and states, such as leaf area and carbon stocks, which influence carbon fluxes and are diagnostic of carbon turnover times. Comparisons can also be made between between carbon and water cycles and other aspects of the terrestrial carbon cycle. To provide these multiple orthogonal constraints, a model benchmarking system – the international land model benchmarking (ILAMB) – has been developed (Collier et al., 2018)."

Simulated cumulative ocean carbon uptake (1850–2014) ranges from 110 to 166 GtC, with a model mean of 131 ± 17 PgC, which is lower than the GCP estimate of 150 ± 25 GtC (Figure 5.23a).

This range is due in part to the complications of simulating the difference between carbon uptake by intact ecosystems and the direct release of carbon due to land-use change (Hajima et al., 2020a). There is  high confidence that the land continues to dominate the overall uncertainty in the projected response of the global carbon cycle to climate change."

The ocean carbon cycle components of CMIP6 ESMs are able to simulate the tropical CO2 source and mid-latitude CO2 sink, with relatively small model spread (Figure 5.24a). The CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge) simulates a larger ocean carbon sink at 50°N and a weaker sink in the Southern Ocean, than the inversion estimate, but with some evidence of a reduction in these residual errors compared to CMIP5 (blue wedge). The spread in inversion fluxes arises primarily from differences in the atmospheric CO2 measurement networks and from transport model uncertainties."

There is indeed some evidence that the CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge in Figure 5.24b) captures the northern land carbon sink more clearly than CMIP5 (blue wedge in Figure 5.24b), but there remains a tendency for the ESMs to place more of the global land carbon sink in the tropics than the mid-latitudes, compared to the inversion estimates. Based on a consistent signal across CMIP6 ESMs, there is medium confidence that land carbon cycle models continue to underestimate the Northern Hemisphere land carbon sink, when compared to estimates from atmospheric inversion (Ciais et al., 2019)."

As a result, the evolution of land and ocean carbon sinks differs significantly between the SSP scenarios. Under scenarios that have greater increases in atmospheric CO2 (such as SSP5-8.5 and SSP3-7.0) the absolute values of the sinks are larger, but the fraction of implied emissions taken up by the sinks declines through the 21st century. By contrast, scenarios that assume CO2 stabilization in the 21st century (such as SSP1-2.6 or SSP2-4.5), have smaller absolute sinks, but these sinks take up an increasing fraction of the implied emissions (Figure 5.25d).

In the mid- and high-northern latitudes, a carbon sink is projected as a result of the combined impacts of increasing CO2 and warming (Section 5.4.5.5).

For the ensemble mean, increasing atmospheric CO2 increases carbon uptake by the oceans, especially in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, and on the land, especially in tropical and boreal forests (β, Figure 5.27a). Climate change further enhances land carbon storage in the boreal zone, but has a compensating negative impact on the carbon sink in tropical and subtropical lands, and in the North Atlantic Ocean (γ , Figure 5.27b). Overall, the ensemble mean of the CMIP6 ESMs model indicates increasing carbon storage with CO2 in almost all locations (Figure 5.27c)."
wg1_ch05_5.4.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"To give confidence in their projections, models need to be compared to the widest possible array of observational benchmarks. This is particularly the case for highly uncertain land carbon cycle feedbacks (Arora et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014b). Land models within ESMs can be compared to multiple different datasets that test different aspects of the models. These include fluxes, such as gross carbon uptake, and states, such as leaf area and carbon stocks, which influence carbon fluxes and are diagnostic of carbon turnover times. Comparisons can also be made between between carbon and water cycles and other aspects of the terrestrial carbon cycle. To provide these multiple orthogonal constraints, a model benchmarking system – the international land model benchmarking (ILAMB) – has been developed (Collier et al., 2018)."

The mean of the CMIP6 land models outperforms or performs equivalently to the mean of the CMIP5 land models on all available metrics."

Simulated cumulative ocean carbon uptake (1850–2014) ranges from 110 to 166 GtC, with a model mean of 131 ± 17 PgC, which is lower than the GCP estimate of 150 ± 25 GtC (Figure 5.23a). This suggests that CMIP6 models may slightly underestimate historical ocean carbon uptake (Watson et al., 2020)."

This range is due in part to the complications of simulating the difference between carbon uptake by intact ecosystems and the direct release of carbon due to land-use change (Hajima et al., 2020a). There is  high confidence that the land continues to dominate the overall uncertainty in the projected response of the global carbon cycle to climate change."

We compare the ESM simulations to estimates from three atmospheric inversion models: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS; Chevallier et al., 2005), Carbon Tracker 2017 (Peters et al., 2007) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate Atmospheric Transport Model (MIROC-ATM4; Saeki and Patra, 2017). The ocean carbon cycle components of CMIP6 ESMs are able to simulate the tropical CO2 source and mid-latitude CO2 sink, with relatively small model spread (Figure 5.24a). The CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge) simulates a larger ocean carbon sink at 50°N and a weaker sink in the Southern Ocean, than the inversion estimate, but with some evidence of a reduction in these residual errors compared to CMIP5 (blue wedge). The spread in inversion fluxes arises primarily from differences in the atmospheric CO2 measurement networks and from transport model uncertainties."

The inclusion of nitrogen limitations on CO2 -fertilization within CMIP6 models was expected to reduce this discrepancy (Anav et al., 2013). There is indeed some evidence that the CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge in Figure 5.24b) captures the northern land carbon sink more clearly than CMIP5 (blue wedge in Figure 5.24b), but there remains a tendency for the ESMs to place more of the global land carbon sink in the tropics than the mid-latitudes, compared to the inversion estimates. Based on a consistent signal across CMIP6 ESMs, there is medium confidence that land carbon cycle models continue to underestimate the Northern Hemisphere land carbon sink, when compared to estimates from atmospheric inversion (Ciais et al., 2019)."

As a result, the evolution of land and ocean carbon sinks differs significantly between the SSP scenarios. Under scenarios that have greater increases in atmospheric CO2 (such as SSP5-8.5 and SSP3-7.0) the absolute values of the sinks are larger, but the fraction of implied emissions taken up by the sinks declines through the 21st century. By contrast, scenarios that assume CO2 stabilization in the 21st century (such as SSP1-2.6 or SSP2-4.5), have smaller absolute sinks, but these sinks take up an increasing fraction of the implied emissions (Figure 5.25d).

Cumulative ocean carbon uptake from 1850 is projected to saturate at approximately 290 ± 30 GtC under SSP1-2.6, and to reach 520 ± 40 GtC by 2100 under SSP5-8.5 (Figure 5.25e)."

In all scenarios the ocean sink is strongest in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. The land carbon sink occurs primarily where there are present-day forests. In the mid- and high-northern latitudes, a carbon sink is projected as a result of the combined impacts of increasing CO2 and warming (Section 5.4.5.5). Changes in land carbon storage in the tropics also depend strongly on the assumed rate of deforestation which varies in magnitude across the SSPs, from relatively low rates in SSP1-2.6 to relatively high rates in SSP3-7.0."

In the ensemble mean, ESMs suggest approximately equal global land and ocean carbon uptake for each of the SSP scenarios. However, the range of model projections is much larger for the land carbon sink. Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO2 by 2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than carbon–climate feedbacks (high confidence)."

Many of these of feedbacks are only partially understood, and thus were only partially addressed in AR5 (WGI, Sections 6.3.3, 6.3.4 and 6.4.7).

In addition to estimates from ESMs, the feedback parameter α  is estimated from independent estimates of surface emission climate sensitivities and atmospheric box models, following (Arneth et al., 2010; Thornhill et al., 2021). These assessed feedback parameters are used in Section 7.4.2.5."
wg1_ch05_5.4.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"The CH4 feedbacks may arise from changing wetland emissions (including rice farming) and from sources that are expected to grow under climate change (e.g., related to permafrost thaw, fires, and freshwater bodies). CH4 emissions from wetlands and landfills generally increase with warming due to enhanced decomposition with higher temperatures, thereby potentially providing a positive CH4 feedback on climate (Dean et al., 2018). The contribution of wetlands to interannual variability of atmospheric CH4 is shaped by the different impacts of temperature and precipitation anomalies on wetland emissions (e.g., during El Niño episodes) and therefore the relationship between climate anomalies and the wetland contribution to the CH4 growth rate is complex (Pison et al., 2013; Nisbet et al., 2016; X. Zhang et al., 2020). As assessed by SROCC (IPCC, 2019b), there is  high agreement across model simulations that wetlands CH4 emissions will increase in the 21st century, butlow agreement in the magnitude of the change (Denisov et al., 2013; Shindell et al., 2013; B.D. Stocker et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017; Koffi et al., 2020). Climate change increases wetland emissions (Gedney et al., 2004, 2019; Volodin, 2008; Ringeval et al., 2011; Denisov et al., 2013; Shindell et al., 2013) and gives rise to an estimated wetland CH4–climate feedback of 0.03 ± 0.01 W m–2°C–1 (mean ± 1 standard deviation; limited evidence,  high agreement) (Arneth et al., 2010; Shindell et al., 2013; B.D. Stocker et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017). The effect of rising CO2 on productivity, and therefore on the substrate for methanogenesis, can further increase the projected increase in wetland CH4 emissions (Ringeval et al., 2011; Melton et al., 2013). Model projections accounting for the combined effects of CO2 and climate change suggest a potentially larger climate feedback (0.01–0.16 W m–2°C–1) (limited evidence, low agreement) (Gedney et al., 2019; Thornhill et al., 2021). Methane release from wetlands depends on the nutrient availability for methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms that can further modify this feedback (Stepanenko et al., 2016; Donis et al., 2017; Beaulieu et al., 2019). Methane emissions from thermokarst ponds and wetlands resulting from permafrost thaw are estimated to contribute an additional CH4-climate feedback of 0.01 [0.003 to 0.04, 5–95% range] W m–2°C–1 (limited evidence, low agreement)."

Methane emissions from pan-Arctic freshwater bodies is also estimated to increase by 16 TgCH4yr–1 in the 21st century (Tan and Zhuang, 2015).

A positive land N2O climate feedback is consistent with paleo-evidence based on reconstructed and modelled emissions during the last deglacial period (Schilt et al., 2014; H. Fischer et al., 2019; Joos et al., 2020). The response of terrestrial N2O emissions to atmospheric CO2 increase and associated warming is dependent on nitrogen availability (van Groenigen et al., 2011; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2019). Model-based estimates do not account for the potentially strong emissions increases in boreal and arctic ecosystems associated with future warming and permafrost thaw (Elberling et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2017).

There is low confidence in the estimate of the non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks, due to the large range in the estimates of α  for some individual feedbacks (Figure 5.29c), which can be attributed to the diversity in how models account for these feedbacks, limited process-level understanding, and the existence of known feedbacks where there is insufficient evidence to assess the feedback strength."
wg1_ch05_5.4.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"CO2 and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks are an important component of the assessment of TCRE and the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5). The feedbacks of the carbon cycle of CO2 and climate are implicitly taken account in the TCRE assessment, because they are represented in the various underlying lines of evidence. Other feedback contributions, such as the non-CO2 biogeochemical feedback, can be converted into a carbon-equivalent feedback term (γ; Section 5.4.5.5, 7.6) by reverse application of the linear feedback approximation (Gregory et al., 2009). The contributions of non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks combine to a linear feedback term of 30 ± 27 PgCeq °C–1 (1 standard deviation range, 111 ± 98 Gt CO2- eq °C–1), including a feedback term of –11 [–18 to –5] PgCeq °C–1 (5–95% range, –40 [–62 to –18] Gt CO2- eq °C–1) from natural CH4 and N2O sources. The biogeochemical feedback from permafrost thaw leads to a combined linear feedback term of –21 ± 12 PgCeq °C–1 (1 standard deviation range –77 ± 44 Gt CO2- eq °C–1). For the integration of these feedbacks in the assessment of the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5.2), two individual non-CO2 feedbacks (tropospheric ozone, and methane lifetime) are captured in the AR6-calibrated emulators (Box 7.1). Excluding those two contributions, the resulting combined linear feedback term for application in Section 5.5.2 is assessed at a reduction of 7 ± 27 PgCeq °C–1 (1 standard deviation range, –26 ± 97 PgCeq °C–1). For the same reasons as for the feedback terms expressed in W m–2°C–1 (see above), there is overall low confidence in the magnitude of these feedbacks."
wg1_ch05_5.4.9_p1,5.4.9.1 Assessment of Biogeochemical Tipping Points,"The applicability of the linear feedback framework (Section 5.4.5.5) suggests that large-scale biogeochemical feedbacks are approximately linear in the forcing from changes in CO2 and climate. Nevertheless, regionally the biosphere is known to be capable of producing abrupt changes or even ‘tipping points’ (Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016). Abrupt change is defined as a change in the system that is substantially faster than the typical rate of the changes in its history (Section 1.4.5). A related matter is a tipping point: a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly. Possible abrupt changes in the Earth system include those related to ecosystems and biogeochemistry (Lenton et al., 2008; Steffen et al., 2018): tropical and boreal forest dieback; and release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from permafrost and methane clathrates (Table 5.6). In this section we therefore focus on estimating upper limits on the possible impact of abrupt changes on the evolution of atmospheric GHGs out to 2100, for comparison to the impact of direct anthropogenic emissions."
wg1_ch05_5.4.9.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Published examples of abrupt biogeochemical changes in models include tropical rain forest dieback (Cox et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2009; Brando et al., 2014; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017), and temperate and boreal forest dieback (Joos et al., 2001; Lucht et al., 2006; Scheffer et al., 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Section 5.4.3). Such transitions may be related to: (i) large-scale changes in mean climate conditions crossing particular climate thresholds (Joos et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2004; Lucht et al., 2006; Hirota et al., 2011; Scheffer et al., 2012; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017); (ii) temperature and precipitation extremes (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Scheffer et al., 2012; Pavlov, 2015; Zemp et al., 2017); or (iii) possible enhancement and intermittency in fire activity (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Brando et al., 2020). Simulated changes in forest cover are a combination of the effects of CO2 on photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (Section 5.4.1), and the effects of climate change on photosynthesis, respiration and disturbance (Section 5.4.3). In ESMs, direct CO2 effects tend to enhance forest growth, but the impacts of climate change vary between being predominantly negative in the tropics and predominantly positive in the boreal zone (Figure 5.27)."

Since AR5, experiments with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) under the RCP8.5 extension scenario to 2300, suggest that both land and ocean carbon–climate feedbacks strengthen in time, land and ocean carbon-concentration feedbacks weaken, and the relative importance of ocean sinks versus land sinks increases (Randerson et al., 2015). Under high emissions scenarios, this relative strengthening of land carbon–climate feedbacks leads the terrestrial biosphere to shift from sink to source at some point after 2100 in all of the CMIP5 ESMs and CMIP5-era Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) (Tokarska et al., 2016). The strengthening of land and ocean carbon–climate feedbacks projected beyond 2100 under high emissions scenarios offsets the declining climate sensitivity to incremental increases of CO2, leading to a net strengthening of carbon cycle feedbacks, as measured by the gain parameter, from one century to the next (Randerson et al., 2015)."

Under all three scenarios, all five models project a reversal of the terrestrial carbon cycle from a sink to a source. However, the reasons for these reversals under very high emissions and low/negative emissions are very different. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the terrestrial carbon–climate feedback is projected to strengthen, while the carbon-concentration feedbacks weaken after emissions peak at 2100, which together drives the land to become a net carbon source after 2100 (Tokarska et al., 2016). The difference in both timing and magnitude of this transition across the ensemble, leads to an assessment of medium confidence in the likelihood and low confidence in the timing and strength, of the land transitioning from a net sink to a net source under such a scenario. Based on high agreement across all available models, we assess with  high confidence that the ocean sink strength would weaken but not reverse under a long-term high emissions scenario. In the SSP5-3.4-overshoot scenario, both the terrestrial and ocean reservoirs act as transient carbon sources during the overshoot period, when net anthropogenic CO2 emissions are negative and CO2 concentrations are falling, and then revert to near-zero (land) or weak sink (ocean) fluxes after stabilization of atmospheric CO2. The SSP1-2.6 scenario, characterized by lower peak CO2 concentrations, a smaller overshoot, and much less carbon loss from land-use change, shows instead a relaxation towards a neutral biosphere on land, and a sustained weak sink in the ocean (see also Section 5.6.2.2.1.2)."

Perfect-model studies provide an estimate of the upper range of potential predictability for the integrated air–sea CO2 fluxes of about two years globally and up to a decade in some regions (Séférian et al., 2018a; Spring and Ilyina, 2020). Evidence is also emerging for predictive skill of the global air–sea CO2 fluxes of up to six years based on prediction systems initialized with observed physical climate states (Ilyina et al., 2021), with a potential for even longer-term regional predictability in some regions, including the North Atlantic and subpolar Southern Ocean (H.

Temperature variations largely control shorter-term predictability of the ocean carbon sink, while longer-term predictability is related to non-thermal drivers such as ocean circulation and biology (Li et al., 2019). Although there is a substantial spatial heterogeneity, initialized predictions suggest stronger multi-year variations of the air–sea CO2 flux and generally tend to outperform uninitialized simulations on the global scale (Li et al., 2019). The predictive skill of air–sea CO2 flux shows a consistent spatial pattern in different models, despite the wide range of techniques used to assimilate observational information (Regnier et al., 2013). ESM-based prediction systems also demonstrate predictability of other marine biogeochemical properties such as net primary production (Séférian et al., 2014; Yeager et al., 2018; Park et al., 2019) and seawater pH (Brady et al., 2020)."

There is growing evidence that the potential predictive skill of air-land CO2 flux is maintained out to a lead-time of two years (Lovenduski et al., 2019b); this predictability horizon is also supported by perfect model studies (Séférian et al., 2018a; Spring and Ilyina, 2020). The origins of this interannual predictability are not yet fully understood. However, they seem to be associated with the oscillatory behaviour of ENSO (Séférian et al., 2014) and the drivers of terrestrial carbon flux predictability, such as ecosystem respiration and gross primary production (Lovenduski et al., 2019a).

Stocker et al., 2013). The amount of global warming per unit of cumulated carbon dioxide emissions is called the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE). This TCRE relationship is now used to estimate the amount of CO2 emissions that would be consistent with limiting global warming to specific levels (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009, 2012; Meinshausen et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al., 2009; M.

The remainder of CO2 emissions that would be in line with limiting global warming to a specific temperature level (while accounting for all other factors affecting global warming) can be estimated with the help of the TCRE and is referred to as the remaining carbon budget (Rogelj et al., 2019; Matthews et al., 2020). Section 5.5.1 first assesses the TCRE as one of the core concepts underlying the notion of a remaining carbon budget, and Section 5.5.2 then integrates this with other contributing factors from across this assessment to provide a consolidated assessment following the approach of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (Rogelj et al., 2018b).

Starting with an initial description in AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013), a body of literature has since expanded the understanding of physical mechanisms from which a simple proportional relationship between cumulative emissions of CO2 and change in global temperature arises – expressed in either global mean surface temperature (GMST) or global surface air temperature (GSAT)."

wg1_ch05_5.5.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is increased confidence in the near-constancy of TCRE because of the variety of methods that have been used to examine this relationship: sensitivity studies with Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs; Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Ehlert et al., 2017); theory-based equations used to examine ESM and EMIC output (Goodwin et al., 2015; R.G. Williams et al., 2016, 2017b); and simple analytical models that capture aspects of the TCRE relationship (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015). All studies agree that the near-constancy of the TCRE arises from compensation between the diminishing sensitivity of radiative forcing to CO2 at higher atmospheric concentration and the diminishing ability of the ocean to take up heat and carbon at higher cumulative emissions (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009; Frölicher and Paynter, 2015; Goodwin et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall, 2016; Tokarska et al., 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The question of whether, and under which conditions, the TCRE relationship is independent of the historical rate of CO2 emissions (also referred to as ‘pathway independence of TCRE’) has been examined by using simple mathematically tractable models (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017). Based on the assumption that the cumulative fraction of carbon taken up by the terrestrial biosphere is constant, and that the climate feedback parameter and ocean heat uptake efficacy do not change in time, both studies agree that pathway independence is sensitive to the rate of CO2 emissions, such that pathway independence is expected to break down at both very high and very low absolute CO2 emissions rates (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017). Note that, in pathways with strongly declining emissions, the cumulative sink fraction by the combined terrestrial biosphere and ocean is expected to increase (Figure 5.25). The studies also agree that no similar relationship analogous to TCRE can be expected for short-lived non-CO2 forcers, for which the annual emissions are a closer proxy for the implied warming (M. Collins et al., 2013; Sections 6.4, 7.6). MacDougall (2017) suggests that two additional constraints are required to create pathway independence: first, the transport of heat and carbon into the deep ocean should be governed by processes with similar time scales; and second, the ratio of the net change in the atmospheric carbon pool to the net change in the ocean carbon pool should be close to the ratio of the enhanced longwave radiation to space (i.e., the radiative response of the surface) to ocean heat uptake. If these ratios are identical, then TCRE would be completely path independent (MacDougall, 2017). If the ratios are close but not identical, TCRE would be only approximately path independent over a wide range of cumulative emissions (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; MacDougall, 2017)."

Some terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks (such as the permafrost carbon feedback; Section 5.4.8, Box 5.1) have the potential to alter both the linearity and pathway independence of TCRE, if such feedbacks significantly contribute carbon to the atmosphere (Sections 5.5.1.2.3 and 5.4.8, and Box 5.1; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015).

Using an analytical approach, MacDougall and Friedlingstein (2015) quantified a window of constant TCRE – defined as the range in cumulative emissions over which the TCRE remains within 95% of its maximum value – as between 360 to 1560 PgC. However, models with a more sophisticated ocean representation suggest that TCRE could also remain constant for considerably larger quantities of cumulative emissions, up to at least 3000 PgC (Leduc et al., 2015; Tokarska et al., 2016). Beyond this upper limit, studies are inconclusive, with some suggesting that TCRE will decrease (Leduc et al., 2015) and others indicating that the linearity would hold up to as much as 5000 PgC (Tokarska et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"As cumulative emissions increase, weakening land and ocean carbon sinks increase the airborne fraction of CO2 emissions (see Figure 5.25), but each unit increase in atmospheric CO2 has a smaller effect on global temperature owing to the logarithmic relationship between CO2 and its radiative forcing (Matthews et al., 2009; Etminan et al., 2016). At high values of cumulative emissions, some models simulate less warming per unit CO2 emitted, suggesting that the saturation of CO2 radiative forcing becomes more important than the effect of weakened carbon sinks (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015). The behaviour of carbon sinks at high emissions levels remains uncertain, as models used to assess the limits of the TCRE show a large spread in net land carbon balance (Section 5.4.5), and most estimates did not include the effect of permafrost carbon feedbacks (Sections 5.5.1.2.3 and 5.4). The latter would tend to further increase the airborne fraction at high cumulative emissions levels, and could therefore extend the window of linearity to higher total amounts of emissions (MacDougall et al., 2015). Leduc et al. (2016) suggested further that a declining strength of snow and sea ice feedbacks in a warmer world would also contribute to a smaller TCRE at high amounts of cumulative emissions. However, Tokarska et al. (2016) suggested that a large decrease in TCRE for high cumulative emissions is only associated with some EMICs; in the four ESMs analysed in their study, the TCRE remained approximately constant up to 5000 PgC, owing to stronger declines in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake in ESMs compared to EMICs."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Overall, there is  high agreement between multiple lines of evidence (robust evidence) resulting in high confidence that TCRE remains constant for the domain of increasing cumulative CO2 emissions until at least 1500 PgC, with medium confidence of it remaining constant up to 3000 PgC because of less agreement across available lines of evidence."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Global average temperature increase responds over a time scale of about 10 years following the emission of a 100 PgC pulse of CO2 (Joos et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014), with larger emission pulses associated with longer time scales and smaller pulses with shorter ones (Joos et al., 2013; Matthews and Solomon, 2013; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015). This behaviour is confirmed in other studies, including those that calculate the temperature response to an instantaneous doubling or quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015; Hajima et al., 2020b). These findings suggest that the TCRE is sensitive to the rate of emissions, but studies assessing this sensitivity have found diverging results. For example, an increase in TCRE and its surrounding uncertainty was reported for experiments that imply a gradual decline in annual CO2 emissions (Tachiiri et al., 2019). These studies suggest that, in most cases, TCRE would be expected to increase in scenarios with decreasing annual emissions rates. This increase in TCRE for annual CO2 emissions declining towards zero can be the result of the zero emissions commitment (ZEC) which is the amount of warming projected to occur following a complete cessation of emissions (see Section 4.7.1.1 for its assessment), as well as Earth system processes that are unrepresented in current TCRE estimates (Section 5.5.2.2.4) and other factors. When using TCRE to estimate CO2 emissions consistent with a specific maximum warming level, these factors have to be taken into account (see Figure 5.31). Combined with recent literature on the ZEC (MacDougall et al., 2020) and emissions pathways (Huppmann et al., 2018) and noting the lack of literature that disentangles these various contributions, there is medium evidence and  high agreement resulting inmedium confidence that the TCRE remains a good predictor of CO2 -induced warming when applied in the context of emissions reduction pathways, provided that ZEC and long-term Earth system feedbacks are adequately accounted for when emissions decline towards zero (see also Section 5.5.1.2.3)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"There are relatively few studies that have assessed how the TCRE is expected to change in scenarios of declining emissions followed by net negative annual CO2 emissions. Conceptually, the literature suggests that the small lag of about a decade between CO2 emissions and temperature change (Ricke and Caldeira, 2014; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015) would result in more warming at a given amount of cumulative emissions in a scenario where that emissions level is first exceeded and then returned to by deploying negative emissions (referred to as an ‘overshoot’, as is often the case in scenarios that aim to limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 2.6 or 1.9 W m–2 (Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018a). Zickfeld et al. (2016) showed this to hold across a range of scenarios, with positive emissions followed by negative emissions, whereby the TCRE increased by about 10% across the transition from positive to negative emissions as a result of the thermal and carbon inertia of the deep ocean. However, CMIP6 results for the SSP5-3.4-overshoot scenario show diverging trends across various ESMs (Figure 5.30). In an idealized CO2 -concentration-driven setting, Tachiiri et al. (2019) also reported an increase in TCRE. Exploring pathways with emissions rates and overshoots closer to mitigation pathways considered over the 21st century (in this case up to about 300 PgC), a recent emissions-driven EMIC experiment showed pathway independence of TCRE (Tokarska et al., 2019a). Furthermore, also in absence of net negative emissions, warming would not necessarily remain perfectly constant on time scales of centuries and millennia, but could decrease or increase (Frölicher and Paynter, 2015; R.G. Williams et al., 2017a; Hajima et al., 2020b). These additional changes in global mean temperature increase at various time scales are known as the ZEC (C.D. Jones et al., 2019; MacDougall et al., 2020), assessed in Section 4.7.1.1, and have to be integrated when using TCRE to estimate warming or remaining carbon budgets in overshoot scenarios."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"The AR5-assessed (W.J. Collins et al., 2013) TCRE range was based in part on the ESMs available at the time, which did not include some potentially important Earth system feedbacks. Since then, a number of studies have assessed the importance of permafrost carbon feedbacks, in particular on remaining carbon budgets (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2017b; Gasser et al., 2018; Lowe and Bernie, 2018), a development highlighted and assessed in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Rogelj et al., 2018b). MacDougall and Friedlingstein (2015) reported a TCRE increase of about 15% when including permafrost carbon feedbacks. The overall linearity of the TCRE during the 21st century was not affected, but they also found that permafrost carbon feedbacks caused an increase in TCRE on multi-century time scales under declining CO2 emissions rates. In addition, other processes that are not regarded, or are only partially considered in individual or all ESMs, could cause a further increase or decrease of TCRE (Matthews et al., 2020). These are discussed in detail in Section 5.4, but their quantitative effects on TCRE have not yet been explored by the literature."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Whether TCRE remains an accurate predictor of CO2 -induced warming when annual CO2 emissions reach zero and are followed by net carbon dioxide removal (also referred to as TCRE reversibility) therefore hinges on contributions of slow components of the climate system that cause unrealized warming from past CO2 emissions. Such slow components can arise from either physical climate (i.e., ocean heat uptake) or carbon cycle (i.e., ocean carbon uptake and permafrost carbon release) processes. The combined effect of these processes determines the magnitude and sign of the ZEC (MacDougall et al., 2020), which in turn impacts TCRE reversibility. As discussed in Section 4.7.1.1, recent model estimates of the ZEC suggest a range of ±0.19°C centred on zero (MacDougall et al., 2020). This suggests low agreement among models as to the reversibility of the TCRE in response to net-negative CO2 emissions. Furthermore, most models used for ZEC assessments to date do not represent permafrost carbon processes, although understanding their contribution is essential to quantify the TCRE contribution. There is therefore limited evidence that quantifies the impact of permafrost carbon feedbacks on the reversibility of TCRE, leading to low confidence that the TCRE remains an accurate predictor of temperature changes in scenarios of net-negative CO2 emissions on time scales of more than a half a century."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013) assessed that the TCRE is likely  to fall in the range of 0.8°C –2.5°C per 1000 PgC (or per exagrams of carbon, EgC–1) for cumulative emissions up to 2000 PgC, based on multiple lines of evidence. These include estimates based on ESMs of varying complexity (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013), simple climate modelling approaches (Allen et al., 2009; Rogelj et al., 2012) or observational constraints and attributable warming (Gillett et al., 2013)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, new studies have further expanded the evidence base for estimating the value of TCRE. These studies rely on ESMs or EMICs, observational constraints and concepts of attributable warming, or theoretically derived equations (see Table 5.7 for an overview). Several studies have endeavoured to partition the uncertainty in the value of TCRE into constituent sources. For example, TCRE can be decomposed into terms of TCR and the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over time (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009). These two terms are assessed individually (see Section 5.4 and Chapter 7, respectively) and allow the integration of evidence assessed elsewhere in the report into the assessment of TCRE (Section 5.5.1.4). Further studies use a variety of methods, including analysing the outputs from CMIP5 (R.G. Williams et al., 2017b) or CMIP6 (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020), conducting perturbed parameter experiments with a single model (MacDougall et al., 2017), Monte-Carlo methods applied to a simple climate model (Spafford and Macdougall, 2020), or observations and estimates of the contribution of CO2 and non-CO2 forcers (Matthews et al., 2021). All of the studies agree that uncertainty in climate sensitivity – either equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) or transient climate response (TCR) – is among the most important contribution to uncertainty in TCRE, with uncertainty in the strength of the land carbon feedback and ocean heat uptake or ventilation having also been identified as crucial to uncertainty in TCRE (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Ehlert et al., 2017; MacDougall et al., 2017; R.G. Williams et al., 2017a, 2020; Katavouta et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020; Spafford and Macdougall, 2020). Finally, internal variability has been shown to affect the maximum accuracy of TCRE estimates by ±0.1°C per 1000 PgC (5–95% range; Tokarska et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Studies differ in how they define TCRE, in the methods they use, and their assumptions, such as the assumed climate sensitivity distribution or the choice of metrics of global temperature change (e.g., GMST or GSAT, see Table 5.7). This makes TCRE estimates from individual studies difficult to compare. The combined assessment of TCRE therefore takes advantage of the well-established decomposition of TCRE in two factors: the TCR and the AF (Section 5.5.1.3). This provides a TCRE assessment range for CO2 -induced warming at the time of doubling CO2 concentrations that builds on the broader Working Group 1 assessment. Expert judgement based on the airborne fraction range found in CMIP6 models (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) suggest a value of 53% with a 1-sigma range of ±6%, which is double the sigma range based on the spread of CMIP6 models only. Combining this range with the AR6 TCR assessment (Section 7.5, best estimate 1.8°C, 1.4°C–2.2°Clikely  and 1.2°C–2.4°Cvery likely range) results in a 5–95% range of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC (0.27°C–0.63°C per 1000 GtCO2). Based on expert judgement that accounts for the incomplete coverage of all Earth system components, this results in a consolidated assessment that TCRE would fall likely  in the range of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC, with a best estimate of 1.65°C per 1000 PgC (0.45°C per 1000 GtCO2). Warming here reflects the human-induced GSAT increase and assumes a normal distribution. Some studies using observational constraints support a lognormal shape for the TCRE distribution (Spafford and Macdougall, 2020), but such a distribution is currently not supported by the combined assessment of TCR and airborne fraction. Finally, this assessed TCRE range needs to be considered in combination with the ZEC (Section 4.7.1.1) when estimating the CO2 -induced warming of low-emissions scenarios."

wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,Context
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"In the past 60 years, the ocean has taken up and stored 23 ± 5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions (medium confidence) (Section 5.2.1.3) as well as more than 90% of the heat that has accumulated in the Earth system (referred to as excess heat) since the 1970s (Sections 7.2.2, 9.2.2 and 9.2.3, and Box 7.2; Frölicher et al., 2015; Talley et al., 2016; Gruber et al., 2019b; Hauck et al., 2020). The interplay between heat and CO2 uptake by the ocean has played a major role in slowing the rate of global warming, and also provides a first order influence in determining the unique properties of a metric of the coupled climate–carbon cycle response – transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) – which is critical to setting the future remaining carbon emissions budget (Sections 5.5.1.3 and 5.5.4). This role of the ocean in the uptake of heat and anthropogenic CO2 and related feedbacks is what we term the ‘ocean carbon–heat nexus’. The ocean processes behind this nexus are important in shaping and understanding the near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global warming (TCRE) as well as the uncertainties in future projections of TCRE properties (Zickfeld et al., 2016; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020), its path independence (MacDougall, 2017), and the warming commitment after cessation of greenhouse gas emissions – the zero emissions commitment (ZEC; Section 5.5.2; Zickfeld et al., 2016; Ehlert and Zickfeld, 2017). In this box, we assess the role of the ocean and its physical and chemical thermodynamic processes that shape these striking characteristics."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The role of the ocean in setting the coupled climate–carbon cycle response is threefold. First, the ocean and land carbon sinks together set the airborne fraction (AF) of CO2 in the atmosphere, which sets the radiative forcing that drives the additional heat in the atmosphere, most of which is taken up by the ocean (Sections 7.2 and 9.2; Katavouta et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019). the land carbon sink does not appear to play an important role in determining the linearity and path-independence of TCRE (Section 5.5.1.1; Goodwin et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Ehlert et al., 2017). Second, the ocean sets the thermal response through ocean heat uptake (Section 9.2; Frölicher et al., 2015; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). Third, there is a feedback within the ocean carbon–heat nexus as ocean warming, particularly under low or no mitigation scenarios, weakens the ocean sink of CO2, which influences the AF, and hence the radiative forcing (Box 7.1; Williams et al., 2019). The near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global warming (TCRE) is thought to arise, to a large extent, from the compensation between the decreasing ability of the ocean to take up heat and CO2 at higher cumulative CO2 emissions, pointing to similar processes that determine ocean uptake of heat and carbon (Section 5.5.1.1; Goodwin et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Zickfeld et al., 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p5,NO_TITLE,Processes that drive the ocean carbon–heat nexus and its change
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"The air–sea flux of heat and all gases across the ocean interface is driven by a common set of complex and turbulent diffusion and mixing processes that are difficult to observe (Sections 5.2.1.3 and 9.2.1.2; Wanninkhof et al., 2009; Wanninkhof, 2014; Cronin et al., 2019; Watson et al., 2020). These processes are typically simplified into widely verified expressions that link the flux to wind stress, the solubility and the gradient across the air–sea interface (medium confidence). Because the ocean has a higher heat capacity than the atmosphere (the heat capacity of the upper 100 m of the ocean is about 30 times larger than the heat capacity of the atmosphere), the partitioning of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean is primarily influenced by the temperature differences between air and seawater. Similarly, the unique seawater carbonate buffering capacity enables CO2 to be stored in the ocean as dissolved salts, rather than just as dissolved gas; this increases the capacity of seawater to store CO2 by two orders of magnitude beyond the solubility of CO2 gas and approximates the partitioning ratio of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean (Section 9.2.2.1; Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2009; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). The role of the biological carbon pump in influencing the ocean sink of anthropogenic carbon into the ocean interior is assessed to be minimal during the historical period, but this may change, particularly in regional contexts, by 2100 (medium confidence) (Laufkötter et al., 2015; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Its role is important in the natural or pre-industrial carbon cycle (medium confidence) (Henson et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Under climate change, the buffering capacity of the ocean decreases (increasing Revelle Factor), which reflects a decreasing capacity for the ocean to take up additional anthropogenic CO2 and store it in the dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir (Egleston et al., 2010). In contrast to CO2, there is no physical limitation that would reduce the ability of surface ocean temperature to equilibrate with the atmospheric temperature. However, both carbon and heat fluxes depend on air–sea heat fluxes that in turn depend on gradients of characteristics at the air–sea interface. These gradients at the air–sea interface respond to ocean dynamics, such as the volume of the surface mixed-layer that equilibrates with the atmosphere, and ocean circulation that can flush the surface layer with water masses that have not equilibrated with the atmosphere for a long time. Limited recent evidence suggests that the effect of small-scale dynamics absent in climate and Earth system models might be locally important (Bachman and Klocker, 2020). In summary, changes in heat and carbon uptake by the ocean rely on a combination of unique chemical and shared physical processes, any of which have the potential to disrupt the coherence of heat and CO2 change in the ocean."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p8,NO_TITLE,Spatial pattern of air–sea fluxes and storage
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Large-scale regional and global ocean circulation shape the spatial pattern of the uptake and storage of both CO2 and heat (see Figure 5.8 for carbon; Figure 9.6 for heat observations; Section 9.2; Frölicher et al., 2015; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). This coherence of spatial patterns driven by the large-scale ocean circulation has three aspects. First, notwithstanding interannual-decadal variability in heat and CO2 uptake, there is a spatial coherence of the temporally integrated uptake at the air–sea boundary, particularly in the Southern Ocean (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1; Talley et al., 2016; Keppler and Landschützer, 2019; Auger et al., 2021). Second, the importance of the meridional overturning circulation in the subsequent storage of both heat and CO2 in mode, intermediate and deep waters of the ocean interior (Section 9.2). Third, of particular note, the roles of the North Atlantic Ocean (Section 9.2.3.1) and the Southern Ocean (Section 9.2.3.2) in linking the spatial pattern of air–sea fluxes, the storage of heat and carbon, and ultimately in understanding and predicting the sensitivity of the carbon-heat nexus to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p11,NO_TITLE,"The role of the large-scale circulation in shaping these fluxes is to: (i) flush the ocean surface layer with deep waters that are relatively cold and with weak or no anthropogenic CO2 and heat content because they have been isolated from the atmosphere for centuries; and (ii) transport the anthropogenic CO2 and heat at depth, away from the atmosphere (Frölicher et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2015; Armour et al., 2016). For instance, in the Southern Ocean, upwelled water masses take up a large amount of anthropogenic CO2 and heat (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1), which are then exported northward by the circulation to be stored at depth in the Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyres (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1; Figure 9.7). In the North Atlantic, the signature of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is also clearly visible, with large amounts of heat and carbon being stored beneath the North Atlantic subtropical gyre at 1 km depth (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1). In summary, the net air–sea fluxes of anthropogenic CO2 and heat depend on large-scale circulation, which is associated with upper ocean stratification, mixed-layer depth, and water-mass formation, transport and mixing (Sections 9.1–9.3)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p12,NO_TITLE,Changes in ocean processes and impact on the ocean carbon–heat nexus
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"Future projections of the ocean carbon–heat nexus in the second half of the 21st century, particularly those under weak or no mitigation scenarios, are characterized by the strengthening of the two largest positive feedbacks: weakening surface ocean CO2 buffering capacity (increasing Revelle Factor) and warming that further reduces CO2 solubility and strengthens ocean stratification, which reduces exchange between the ocean surface and interior (Jiang et al., 2019; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). These are offset by a growing but scenario-dependent negative feedback from increasing carbon and heat air–sea fluxes towards the ocean, due to increased atmospheric temperature and CO2 concentrations (Talley et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019; McKinley et al., 2020). The Southern Ocean in particular is one of the regions where the projected feedback can be largest and where inter-model differences are strongest (Roy et al., 2011; Frölicher et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; Mongwe et al., 2018). These projected trends in ocean carbonate chemistry (Section 5.4.2), together with surface ocean warming (Section 9.2.1.1), explain the slow down and long-term reduction of the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 even as emissions continue to rise beyond 2050 under weak-to-no-mitigation scenarios (Figures 2.7.1 and 5.25, and Technical Summary TS Box 7). Projected change in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean overturning circulation also impact air–sea fluxes of heat and carbon. The very likely decline in AMOC in the 21st century for all shared socio-economic pathways (SSP) scenarios (Section 9.2.3.1) tends to reduce heat and carbon uptake, resulting in a positive feedback. In contrast, in the Southern Ocean, the future 21st century projected increase in upper ocean overturning circulation (low confidence) – due to increasing wind forcing projected for all scenarios, except those with large mitigation (SSP1-2.6) – produces a negative feedback, with increasing heat and carbon uptake and storage despite the increasing stratification and outgassing of natural CO2 in the upwelling zone (Sections 9.2.3.2 and 5.2.1.3)."
wg1_ch05_cross-chapter-box-5.3_p14,NO_TITLE,"In summary, a combination of unique chemical properties of seawater carbonate combined with shared physical ocean processes explain the coherence and scaling in the uptake and storage of both CO2 and heat in the ocean, which is the basis for the carbon–heat nexus (high confidence). In this way, the processes of the ocean carbon-heat nexus help understand the quasi-linear and path independence of properties of TCRE, which forms the basis for the zero emissions commitment (ZEC; Section 5.5) (medium confidence). Future projections under low or no mitigation indicate with  high confidence that carbon chemistry and warming will strengthen the positive feedback to climate change by reducing ocean carbon uptake, and medium confidence that ocean circulation may partially compensate that positive feedback by slightly increasing anthropogenic carbon storage. Increasing ocean warming and stratification may decrease exchanges between the surface and subsurface ocean, which could reduce the path independence of TCRE, though this effect can be partially counterbalanced regionally by increasing circulation associated with increasing winds (low confidence)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.2_p1,5.5.2.1 Framework and Earlier Approaches,"Estimates of remaining carbon budgets consistent with holding global warming below a specific temperature threshold depend on a range of factors which are increasingly being studied and quantified. These factors include: (i) well-understood methodological and definitional choices (Sections 5.5.2.1 and 5.5.2.2; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016, 2018b); and (ii) a set of contributing factors such as historical warming, the TCRE and its limitations, the ZEC (the amount of warming projected to occur following a complete cessation of emissions; see Section 4.7.1.1), as well as contributions of non-CO2 climate forcers (Section 5.5.2.2; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015a, b; MacDougall, 2016; Simmons and Matthews, 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2017, 2021; Millar et al., 2017b; Goodwin et al., 2018; Mengis et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018; Cain et al., 2019). These contributing factors are integrated in an overarching assessment of remaining carbon budgets for limiting global average warming to levels ranging from 1.5°C to 2.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels provided in Section 5.5.2.3. Box 5.2 provides an overview of the methodological advances since AR5 (W.J. Collins et al., 2013)."

Studies, however, apply a variety of definitions that result in published remaining carbon budget estimates informing to cumulative emissions at the time when global-mean temperature increase would reach, exceed, avoid, or peak at a given warming level with a given probability (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; IPCC, 2014; Rogelj et al., 2016; Millar et al., 2017b)."

Given that some feedbacks are time dependent, the values in this section apply to limiting warming over the 21st century, consistent with recent studies highlighting the usefulness of time-limited carbon budgets (Sanderson, 2020). Irrespective of the exact definition of the remaining carbon budget, the finding that higher cumulative CO2 emissions lead to higher temperatures implies that annual net CO2 emissions have to decline to close to zero in order to halt global warming, whether at 1.5°C, 2°C or another level (Allen et al., 2018)."

Working Group I (WGI) reported threshold exceedance budgets (TEB) that correspond to the amount of cumulative CO2 emissions at the time a specific temperature threshold is exceeded, with a given probability in a particular greenhouse-gas and aerosol (pre-cursor) emissions scenario (M. Collins et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013b; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013). WGI also reported TEBs for the hypothetical case that only CO2 would be emitted by human activities (M. Collins et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013b; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013). The AR5 Working Group III used threshold avoidance budgets (TAB) that correspond to the cumulative CO2 emissions over a given time period of a subset of greenhouse-gas and aerosol (precursor) emissions scenarios in which global-mean temperature increase stays below a specific temperature threshold with at least a given probability (Clarke et al., 2014). The AR5 synthesis report used TABs defined until the time of peak warming over the 21st century (IPCC, 2014). Drawbacks have been identified for TEBs and TABs (Rogelj et al., 2016). TABs provide an estimate of the cumulative CO2 emissions under pathways that have as a common characteristic the fact that they do not exceed a specific global warming threshold. However, the actual level of maximum warming can vary between pathways, leading to an unnecessary and poorly constrained spread in TAB estimates (Rogelj et al., 2016). Therefore, the TAB approach typically does not result in accurate projections of the remaining carbon budget. One drawback of TEBs is that they provide an estimate of the cumulative CO2 emissions at the time global warming crosses a given threshold of interest in a specific emissions scenario – for example, most of the standard scenarios used in climate change research, such as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) or Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), exceed global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.5) (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Millar et al., 2017b). Because of potential variations in non-CO2 warming at that point in time, or potential lags of about a decade in CO2 warming (Joos et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014; Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2016, 2018b; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015) TEBs also do not provide a precise estimate of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to a specific level."

Most of these approaches indirectly rely on the concept of TCRE (Section 5.5.1), for example, because they estimate modelled cumulative CO2 emissions until a temperature threshold is crossed and use this budget to infer insights for pathways that attempt to limit warming to below this threshold and thus need to follow a different path (Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Matthews et al., 2017; Millar et al., 2017b; Goodwin et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). In this report, the assessment framework of SR1.5 for remaining carbon budgets is applied (Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019). This framework allows integration of multiple lines of evidence to assess the contributions of five components that together result in a consolidated assessment of the remaining carbon budget (TCRE, historical human-induced warming, non-CO2 warming, the ZEC, and adjustments due to additional Earth system feedbacks, see Section 5.5.2.2).

Together with estimates of historical CO2 emissions to date (Section 5.2.1), these remaining carbon budgets provide the overall amount of cumulative CO2 emissions consistent with limiting global warming to specific levels.

This becomes particularly important when assessing remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels that are relatively close to present-day warming, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C levels (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Also shown to be important is the definition of global average temperature by which historical warming is estimated (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3; Cowtan and Way, 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2019b), as is the correct isolation of human-induced global warming (Haustein et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2018) to remove the effect of internal variability.

This choice implies global coverage and is consistent with AR5 where carbon budgets were reported in GSAT (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F.

The use of other historical reference periods (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) or temperature metrics and updated data products (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) can result in a different estimated historical warming and thus a changed remaining carbon budget."

The size of this contribution has been estimated both implicitly (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016; Matthews et al., 2017; Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018) and explicitly (Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2018b; Collins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2021) by varying the assumptions of non-CO2 emissions and associated warming. Internally consistent evolutions of future CO2 and non-CO2 emissions allow for derivation of non-CO2 warming contributions consistent with global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, and therewith capping maximum future CO2 emissions (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; Matthews et al., 2021). Pathways that reflect such development typically show a stabilization or decline in non-CO2 radiative forcing and warming at, and after the time of, global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, as illustrated in the scenario database underlying SR1.5 (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b)."

The estimated implied non-CO2 warming can subsequently be applied to reduce the remaining allowable warming for estimating the remaining carbon budget (Figure 5.31; Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019). Alternative methods estimate the non-CO2 fraction of total anthropogenic forcing (Matthews et al., 2021), or do not correct for non-CO2 warming directly. The latter methods instead consider CO2 and non-CO2 warming together to define a CO2 -forcing equivalent carbon budget from which eventual non-CO2 contributions expressed in CO2 -forcing-equivalent emissions have to be subtracted to obtain a remaining carbon budget (Jenkins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2020). These studies also use emulators to invert a specified evolution of non-CO2 forcing to a corresponding amount of equivalent CO2 emissions (Matthews et al., 2020), or alternatively use empirical relationships linking changes in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions to warming (Cain et al., 2019). Methods to express non-CO2 emissions in CO2 equivalence are assessed in Section 7.6, yet their applicability and related uncertainties for remaining carbon budgets have not yet been covered in-depth in the literature."

Uncertainty surrounding this range due to geophysical uncertainties such as non-CO2 -forcing uncertainties and TCR is of the order of ±0.1°C. Differences in the choices of mitigation strategies considered in low-emissions scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018) result in a potential additional variation around the central range of at least ±0.1°C (spread across scenarios, referred to as non-CO2 scenario uncertainty in Table 5.8)."
wg1_ch05_5.5.2.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Use of TCRE for estimating remaining carbon budgets needs to consider the zero emissions commitment (ZEC), the potential additional warming after a complete cessation of net CO2 emissions. Based on the ZEC assessment presented in Section 4.7.1.1, the ZEC’s central value is taken to be zero with a likely range of ±0.19°C, noting that it might either increase or decrease after half a century. ZEC uncertainty is assessed for a time frame of half a century, as this most appropriately reflects the time between stringent mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 emissions and the end of the century. For shorter time horizons, a similar central zero value applies, but with a smaller range (MacDougall et al., 2020). Experiments that ramped up and down emissions following a bell-shaped trajectory (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016a) show that when annual CO2 emissions decline to zero at a pace consistent with those currently assumed in mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b), the ZEC will already be realized to a large degree at the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions (MacDougall et al., 2020)."

Two of these additional feedbacks (tropospheric ozone and methane lifetime feedbacks) are included in the projections of non-CO2 warming carried out with AR6-calibrated emulators (Box 7.1). The remainder of these independent Earth system feedbacks combine to a feedback of about 7 ± 27 PgC K–1 (1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO2 °C–1). Overall, Section 5.4.8 assessed there to be low confidence in the exact magnitude of these feedbacks and they represent identified additional amplifying factors that scale with additional warming, and mostly increase the challenge of limiting global warming to or below specific temperature levels."

The overall assessment of remaining carbon budgets (Table 5.8) reflects the uncertainty in TCRE quantification and provides estimates of the uncertainties surrounding the contributions of each of the respective further components. A formal combination of all uncertainties is not possible because they are not all independent, or because they represent choices rather than probabilistic uncertainties (Matthews et al., 2021). In light of all uncertainties related to TCRE, non-CO2 forcing and response, the level of non-CO2 mitigation, and historical warming, there is a small probability that the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C since the 1850–1900 period is effectively zero. However, applying best estimate values for all but uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and TCRE, the remaining carbon budgets in line with the Paris Agreement are generally small yet not zero (see Table 5.8)."

Combined with the assessed uncertainties in the Earth system’s response to non-CO2 emissions and less well-established quantification of some of the effect of non-linear Earth system feedbacks, this leads to medium confidence being assigned to the assessed remaining carbon budget estimates while noting the identified and assessed uncertainties and potential variations. The reported values are applicable to warming and cumulative emissions over the 21st century. For climate stabilization beyond the 21st century, this confidence would decline to very low confidence due to uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and the ZEC. For estimates of total carbon budgets in line with limiting global warming to a specific level, an estimate of historical CO2 emissions should be added to the remaining carbon budget values reported in Table 5.8. Historical CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 have been estimated at about 655 ± 65 PgC (1-sigma range, or 2390 ± 240 GtCO2, see Table 5.1), while since 1 January 2015, an additional 57 PgC (210 GtCO2) has been emitted until the end of 2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."

These studies also use emulators to invert a specified evolution of non-CO2 forcing to a corresponding amount of equivalent CO2 emissions (Matthews et al., 2020), or alternatively use empirical relationships linking changes in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions to warming (Cain et al., 2019). Methods to express non-CO2 emissions in CO2 equivalence are assessed in Section 7.6, yet their applicability and related uncertainties for remaining carbon budgets have not yet been covered in-depth in the literature."

Uncertainty surrounding this range due to geophysical uncertainties such as non-CO2 -forcing uncertainties and TCR is of the order of ±0.1°C.

This becomes particularly important when assessing remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels that are relatively close to present-day warming, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C levels (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Also shown to be important is the definition of global average temperature by which historical warming is estimated (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3; Cowtan and Way, 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2019b), as is the correct isolation of human-induced global warming (Haustein et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2018) to remove the effect of internal variability. Based on the assessment in Section 3.3 (Table 3.1), here we apply an assessedbest-estimate of historical warming expressed as an increase in GSAT of 1.07°C (0.8–1.3°C, likely range) between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019. This choice implies global coverage and is consistent with AR5 where carbon budgets were reported in GSAT (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013), SR1.5 where GSAT was the central metric for remaining carbon budgets (Rogelj et al., 2018b), and recent studies that highlight how GSAT enables an easy translation with AR5 (Tokarska et al., 2019b). The use of other historical reference periods (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) or temperature metrics and updated data products (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) can result in a different estimated historical warming and thus a changed remaining carbon budget."

The size of this contribution has been estimated both implicitly (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016; Matthews et al., 2017; Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018) and explicitly (Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2018b; Collins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2021) by varying the assumptions of non-CO2 emissions and associated warming. Internally consistent evolutions of future CO2 and non-CO2 emissions allow for derivation of non-CO2 warming contributions consistent with global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, and therewith capping maximum future CO2 emissions (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; Matthews et al., 2021). Pathways that reflect such development typically show a stabilization or decline in non-CO2 radiative forcing and warming at, and after the time of, global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, as illustrated in the scenario database underlying SR1.5 (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b)."

The overall assessment of remaining carbon budgets (Table 5.8) reflects the uncertainty in TCRE quantification and provides estimates of the uncertainties surrounding the contributions of each of the respective further components. A formal combination of all uncertainties is not possible because they are not all independent, or because they represent choices rather than probabilistic uncertainties (Matthews et al., 2021). In light of all uncertainties related to TCRE, non-CO2 forcing and response, the level of non-CO2 mitigation, and historical warming, there is a small probability that the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C since the 1850–1900 period is effectively zero. However, applying best estimate values for all but uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and TCRE, the remaining carbon budgets in line with the Paris Agreement are generally small yet not zero (see Table 5.8)."

The reported values are applicable to warming and cumulative emissions over the 21st century. For climate stabilization beyond the 21st century, this confidence would decline to very low confidence due to uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and the ZEC.

This framework incorporates five methodological advancements compared to AR5, the implications of which are discussed in this box."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"First, publications since AR5 applied methods that limit the effect of uncertainties in historical, diagnosed emissions in coupled Earth system models (ESMs) on estimates of the remaining carbon budget (Millar et al., 2017b; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). These new methods express remaining carbon budget estimates relative to a recent reference period instead of relative to the pre-industrial period (Millar et al., 2017b; Tokarska et al., 2019b). Estimates of the full carbon budget since the pre-industrial period can still be obtained by adding estimates of historical CO2 emissions (Table 5.1) to the estimates in Table 5.8. This methodological update resulted, all other aspects being equal, in median estimates of remaining carbon budgets being about 350–450 GtCO2 larger compared to AR5 (IPCC, 2014; Millar et al., 2017b)."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"At the time of AR5, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al., 2012) provided global surface air temperature (GSAT) projections for the representative concentration pathways (Meinshausen et al., 2011c), which were used to determine carbon budgets while taking into account the effects of non-CO2 forcers (T.F. Stocker et al., 2013). Their use came with two recognized limitations: first, the model spread of the CMIP5 represents an ensemble of opportunity with limited statistical value (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007); and second, the evolution of non-CO2 emissions as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions can differ markedly between high and low emissions pathways (Meinshausen et al., 2011c; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016; Matthews et al., 2017). Solutions to these two limitations have been published since AR5 and represent the second and third methodological improvement compared to AR5."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The reliance on an ensemble of opportunity (i.e., a serendipitous collection of scenario data from a variety of sources and studies) is avoided by methodologically separating the assessment of future warming contributions of non-CO2 emissions from the spread in transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE; Section 5.5.2; Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019). This facilitates the explicit representation of TCRE uncertainty by a formal distribution, in this case a normal distribution with a 1.0–2.3°C 1000 PgC–11–sigma range (Section 5.5.1.4). The effect of this methodological advance can be estimated from a direct comparison of the frequency distribution of TCRE in CMIP5 models that were used in AR5, and the formal TCRE distribution used in AR6, but is limited in precision. For estimates of the remaining carbon budget in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, this improvement is estimated to lead to a reduction of budgets of the order of about 100 GtCO2 between AR5 and AR6."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"The third methodological improvement is a more direct estimation of the warming contribution of non-CO2 emissions, consistent with pathways that bring global CO2 emissions down to net zero. Instead of deriving this contribution implicitly from the CMIP5 ensemble, climate emulators (Meinshausen et al., 2011b; C.J. Smith et al., 2018; Schwarber et al., 2019) that are calibrated to the combined AR6 assessment (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) are used to estimate the non-CO2 contribution across a wide variety of stringent mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018). The specific relative effect of this advance compared to AR5 is not calculable because CMIP5 data does not isolate non-CO2 from CO2 -induced warming."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"The fourth and fifth methodological advancements are to explicitly account for the zero emissions commitment (ZEC; Section 5.5.2.2.4) and adjust estimates for Earth system feedbacks that are typically not represented in Earth system models (ESMs; Section 5.5.2.2.5). The central estimate of the assessed ZEC used in SR1.5 and AR6 is zero (Section 4.7.1.1). ZEC uncertainties are reported separately (Table 5.8), and the additional consideration of ZEC therefore does result in a better understanding but not in a net shift of central estimates of the remaining carbon budget compared to AR5. Furthermore, AR5 did not explicitly account for Earth system feedbacks not represented in ESMs. The SR1.5 assessed that they could reduce the remaining carbon budgets by about 100 GtCO2 over centennial time scales. This assessment has been updated in AR6, including a wider range of biogeochemical feedbacks and new evidence (Section 5.5.2.2.5). Some of these feedbacks are captured in the estimation of non-CO2 warming (see below), while the combined effect of remaining positive and negative feedbacks is assessed to reduce the remaining carbon budget estimates by 7 ± 27 PgC K–1 (1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO2 °C–1) compared to AR5."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Between SR1.5 and AR6, each of the five components described in Section 5.5.2.1 and Figure 5.31 have been re-assessed (see Sections 5.5.2.2.1–5.5.2.2.5). Their updated assessments in turn affect the assessment of the remaining carbon budget. The new and narrower assessment of TCRE in AR6 compared to SR1.5 (likely range of 1.0°C–2.3°C EgC–1compared to 0.8°C–2.5°C EgC–1, respectively, with the same central estimate) leads to no change in median estimates and about a 50 and 100 GtCO2 increase in remaining carbon budgets estimates at the 67th percentile in AR6 compared to SR1.5 for 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, respectively."
wg1_ch05_box-5.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"For historical warming, SR1.5 used GSAT increase between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 of 0.97°C as its main starting point, while also providing values for other temperature metrics. Remaining carbon budgets were expressed starting from 1 January 2018 by accounting for historical emissions emitted from 1 January 2011 until the end of 2017. AR6 uses anthropogenic (human-induced) warming until the 2010–2019 period, which is assessed at the 0.8-1.3°C range, with a best estimate of 1.07°C (Table 3.1), and subsequently accounts for historical emissions from 1 January 2015 until the end of 2019 to express remaining carbon budget estimates from 1 January 2020 onwards. The human-induced warming between the 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 periods used in SR1.5 was assessed by AR6 at 0.97°C (Table 3.1). In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effect of data and methodological updates in historical warming estimates thus results in no shift in estimated remaining carbon budgets between SR1.5 and AR6. However, the emissions of the years passed since SR1.5 reduce the remaining carbon budget by about 85 GtCO2. Note that AR6 also updated its GSAT assessment for total warming between the 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 periods, reporting 0.94°C of warming. On a like-with-like basis, this would have resulted in slightly larger remaining carbon budgets compared to SR1.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3)."

The re-assessment of non-CO2 warming with MAGICC7 results in a relationship that closely matches the average relationship applied in SR1.5 (shown in Section 2.SM.1.1.2 in Forster et al., 2018), and therefore does not change estimates of the remaining carbon budget relative to SR1.5. The median ZEC assessment remained the same between SR1.5 and AR6, and therefore does not change the median remaining carbon budget estimates. Finally, as indicated above, AR6 expanded the assessment of Earth system feedbacks compared to SR1.5 and included it in its central remaining carbon budget estimates. Some feedbacks are accounted for through the non-CO2 warming estimate (Section 5.5.2.2.5), while the remainder combines to reduce the median remaining carbon budget estimates for 1.5°C and 2°C of warming by about 10 to 20 GtCO2, respectively, compared to SR1.5."

For limiting warming to 2°C, the difference is about 400–500 GtCO2. Since SR1.5, fewer key advancements had to be integrated. In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effects of all AR6 updates result in median remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C being the same and about 60 GtCO2 smaller, respectively, in AR6 compared to SR1.5.

The carbon cycle response to specific land and ocean-based CDR methods is assessed in Section 5.6.2.2.2. At the time of AR5 there were very few studies about the global carbon cycle response to CDR. Based on these studies and general understanding of the carbon cycle, AR5 WGI Chapter 6 assessed that it is virtually certain that deliberate removal of CO2 from the atmosphere will be partially offset by outgassing of CO2 from the ocean and land carbon sinks. Low confidence was placed on any quantification of effects. Since AR5 WGI Chapter 6, several studies have investigated the carbon cycle response to CDR in idealized ‘pulse’ removal simulations, whereby a specified amount of CO2 is removed instantly from the atmosphere, and scenario simulations with CO2 emissions and removals following a plausible trajectory. In addition, a dedicated carbon dioxide removal model intercomparison project was initiated (CDRMIP; Keller et al., 2018b) which includes a range of CDR experiments from idealized simulations to simulations of deployment of specific CDR methods (afforestation and ocean alkalinization)."

wg1_ch05_5.6.2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Idealized ‘pulse’ removal Earth system model simulations are useful for understanding the carbon cycle response to CDR. Figure 5.32 illustrates the response of atmospheric CO2, land and ocean carbon sinks to an instantaneous CO2 removal applied from a pre-industrial equilibrium state. Following CO2 removal from the atmosphere, the atmospheric CO2 concentration declines rapidly at first and then rebounds (Figure 5.32a). This rebound is due to CO2 release by the terrestrial biosphere and the ocean in response to declining atmospheric CO2 levels (Figure 5.32b,c; M. Collins et al., 2013). For the model simulations shown in Figure 5.32, 23 ± 6% (mean ± 1 standard deviation) of the 100 PgC removed remains out of the atmosphere 80–100 years after the instantaneous removal. The remainder is offset by CO2 outgassing from the land (49 ± 12%) and ocean (29 ± 7%). While the direction of the CO2 flux is robust across models, the relative contribution of the outgassing from land and ocean reservoirs to the atmospheric CO2 rebound after removal varies. These results corroborate the  high confidence placed by AR5 WGI (Chapter 6) on the partial compensation of CO2 removal from the atmosphere by CO2 outgassing from the land and ocean. Due to disagreement between models, the magnitude of this outgassing and the relative contribution of land and ocean fluxes remains low confidence."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 WGI (Chapter 6), studies with ESMs have explored the land and ocean carbon sink response to scenarios with CO2 emissions gradually declining during the 21st century. As CDR and other mitigation activities are ramped up, CO2 emissions in these scenarios reach net zero and, as removals exceed emissions, become net negative. Studies exploring the carbon sink response to such scenarios (e.g., RCP2.6, SSP1-2.6) show that, when net CO2 emissions are positive but start to decline, uptake of CO2 by the land and ocean begins to weaken (compare land and ocean CO2 fluxes in panels a and b of Figure 5.33; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). During the first decades after CO2 emissions become net negative, both the ocean and land carbon sinks continue to take up CO2, albeit at a lower rate. For the land carbon sink, the sink-to-source transition occurs decades to a century after CO2 emissions become net negative (Figure 5.33c). The ocean remains a sink of CO2 for centuries after emissions become net negative (Figure 5.33c–e; Section 5.4.9; Figure 5.30). Whether the transition to source occurs at all, the timing of the transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source are determined by the magnitude of the removal and the rate and amount of net CO2 emissions prior to emissions becoming net negative (medium confidence) (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). For scenarios with large amounts of CO2 removal, such as SSP5-3.4-overshoot, the land source is larger than for SSP1-2.6 and the ocean also turns into a source (Section 5.4.10, Figure 5.30). While the qualitative response to scenarios with net-negative emissions is largely robust across models, the timing of the sink-to-source transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source vary between models, particularly for the land sink. Due to low agreement between models, there is low confidence in the timing of the sink-to-source transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source in scenarios with net-negative CO2 emissions."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"It is well understood that land and ocean carbon fluxes are sensitive to the level of atmospheric CO2 and climate change and differ under varied future scenarios (Section 5.4). It is therefore important to establish to what extent the removal effectiveness of CDR – here defined as the fraction of total CO2 removed that remains out of the atmosphere – is dependent on the scenario in which CDR is applied. Different metrics have been proposed to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al., 2016). One is the airborne fraction (AF) of cumulative CO2 emissions, defined in the same way as for positive emissions (i.e., as the fraction of total CO2 emissions remaining in the atmosphere), with its use extended to periods of declining and net negative CO2 emissions. This metric, however, has not proven to be useful to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR in simulations where CDR is applied from a trajectory of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. This is because it measures the carbon cycle response to CDR as well as to the prior atmospheric CO2 trajectory (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). A more useful metric is the perturbation airborne fraction (PAF; Jones et al., 2016b), which measures the AF of the perturbation (in this case the CO2 removal) relative to a reference scenario (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). The advantage of this metric is that it isolates the response to a CO2 removal from the response to atmospheric CO2 prior to when the removal is applied. A disadvantage is that the PAF cannot be calculated from a single model simulation, but instead requires a reference simulation to evaluate the effect of the CO2 removal. When CDR is applied from an equilibrium state, the PAF and AF are equivalent measures."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"In scenario simulations and idealized simulations with instantaneous CO2 removals applied from an equilibrium state, the removal effectiveness of CDR is found to be slightly dependent on the rate and amount of CDR (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al., 2021), and to be strongly dependent on the emissions scenario from which CDR is applied (Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al., 2021). The fraction of CO2 removed remaining out of the atmosphere decreases slightly for larger removals and decreases strongly when CDR is applied from a lower background atmospheric CO2 concentration (Figure 5.34), due to state dependencies and climate–carbon cycle feedbacks that lead to a stronger overall response to CO2 removal (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Based on the  high agreement between studies, we assess with medium confidence that the removal effectiveness of CDR is only slightly dependent on the rate and magnitude of removal and is smaller at lower background atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Simulations with Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMIC) with instantaneous CO2 removal from different equilibrium initial states suggest that the smaller removal effectiveness of CDR at lower background CO2 levels results in greater cooling per unit CO2 removed (Zickfeld et al., 2021). However, there is low confidence in the robustness of this result as climate sensitivity has been shown to exhibit opposite state dependence in EMICs and ESMs (Section 7.4.3.1)."

If the response were symmetric, a positive CO2 emission could be offset by a negative emission of equal magnitude. This subsection assesses the symmetry in the coupled climate–carbon cycle response in model simulations with positive and negative CO2 emission pulses applied from a pre-industrial climate state. Simulations with seven CMIP6 ESMs and the UVic Earth System Climate Model (ESCM) of intermediate complexity suggest that the carbon cycle response is asymmetric for pulse emissions/removals of ±100 PgC (Figure 5.35). For all models, the fraction of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere after an emission is larger than the fraction of CO2 remaining out of the atmosphere after a removal (by 4 ± 3%; mean ± standard deviation). In other words, an emission of CO2 into the atmosphere is more effective at raising atmospheric CO2 than an equivalent CO2 removal is at lowering it. Sensitivity experiments with the UVic ESCM suggest that the asymmetry increases for larger amounts of emissions/removals and is insensitive to the background atmospheric CO2 concentration from which the emissions/removals are applied (Figure 5.35). This asymmetry in the atmospheric CO2 response originates from asymmetries in the land and ocean carbon fluxes due to non-linearities in the carbon cycle response to CO2 and temperature (Section 5.4) (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Givenmedium evidence and  high agreement, there is medium confidence in the sign of the asymmetry of the carbon cycle response to positive and negative CO2 emissions. The sign of the symmetry of the temperature response differs between models, with three out of seven examined ESMs showing a smaller temperature response to a 100 PgC emission than to an equivalent CO2 removal.

wg1_ch05_box-5.3_p1,5.6.2.2 Effects of Specific CDR Methods on Biogeochemical Cycles and Climate,"During the industrial era, CO2 emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change has been redistributed between atmosphere, land, and ocean carbon reservoirs due to carbon cycle processes (Box 5.3, Figure 1b and Figure 5.13). Over the past decade (2010–2019), 46% of the emitted CO2 remained in the atmosphere, 23% was taken up by the ocean, and 31% by the terrestrial biosphere (Section 5.2.1.5). When carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is applied during periods in which human activities are net CO2 sources to the atmosphere, and the amount of emissions removed by CDR is smaller than the net source (net positive CO2 emissions), CDR acts to reduce the net emissions (Box 5.3 Figure 1c). In this scenario, part of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere are removed by the land and ocean sinks, as has been the case historically."
wg1_ch05_box-5.3_p3,5.6.2.2 Effects of Specific CDR Methods on Biogeochemical Cycles and Climate,"When CDR removes more CO2 emissions than human activities emit (net negative CO2 emissions), and atmospheric CO2 declines, the land and ocean sinks initially continue to take up CO2 from the atmosphere. This is because carbon sinks, particularly the ocean, exhibit inertia and continue to respond to the prior trajectory of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. After some time, which is determined by the magnitude of the removal and the rate and amount of CO2 emissions prior to the CDR application, land and ocean carbon reservoirs begin to release CO2 into the atmosphere, making CDR less effective (Box 5.3, Figure 1d)."

Multiple co-benefits were identified in the deployment of CDR options, many of them with a potential to make positive contributions to sustainable development, enhancement of ecosystem functions and services and other societal goals. However, their potential was concluded to be context specific, and limits were identified in their contribution to global mitigation, such as competition for land. The third report, the Special Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) Chapter 5 (IPCC, 2019b), assessed the potential of marine options for climate change mitigation. It concluded that the feasibility of open ocean fertilization and alkalinization approaches were negligible, due to their inconclusive influence on ocean carbon storage on long time scales, due to the unintended side effects on marine ecosystems, and the associated governance challenges. The assessment of blue carbon ecosystems concluded that they could contribute only minimally to atmospheric CO2 reduction globally, but emphasized that the benefits of protecting and restoring coastal blue carbon extend beyond climate change mitigation (SROCC (Section 5.5.12)."

There is low confidence in the net direction of feedbacks of afforestation on global mean temperature. The feedbacks are highly region dependent. For instance, afforestation at high latitudes would decrease albedo and increase local warming, while at low latitudes, the cooling effect of enhanced evapotranspiration could exceed the warming effect due to albedo decrease (Pearson et al., 2013; W.

Methods to increase soil carbon content may be applied to the restoration of marginal or degraded land (Paustian et al., 2016; Smith, 2016), but may also be used in traditional agricultural lands. A simple practice is to increase the input of carbon to the soil by selecting appropriate varieties or species with greater root mass (Kell, 2011) or higher yields and net primary production (NPP) (Burney et al., 2010). In addition, improved agricultural practices also increase soil carbon content. These include using crop rotation cycles, increasing the amount of crop residues, using crop cover to prevent periods of bare soil (Poeplau and Don, 2015; Griscom et al., 2017), optimizing grazing (Henderson et al., 2015) and residue management (Wilhelm et al., 2004), using irrigation (Campos et al., 2020), employment of low-tillage or no-tillage (W. Sun et al., 2020), agroforestry, cropland nutrient recycling, and avoiding grassland conversion (Paustian et al., 2016; Fargione et al., 2018).

However, if improved soil carbon sequestration practices involve higher fertilization rates, N2O emissions would increase (Gu et al., 2017). Some soil carbon sequestration methods, such as cover crops and crop diversity, can increase biodiversity (medium confidence) (Paustian et al., 2016; P. Smith et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Biochar is produced by burning biomass at high temperatures under anoxic conditions (pyrolysis) and, when added to soils, can increase soil carbon stocks and fertility for decades to centuries (Woolf et al., 2010; Lehmann et al., 2015). Biochar application improves many soil qualities and increases crop yield (medium confidence) (Ye et al., 2020; SRCCL, Chapter 4.9.5), particularly in already degraded or weathered soils (Woolf et al., 2010; Lorenz and Lal, 2014; Jeffery et al., 2016), increases soil water holding capacity (medium  confidence) (Karhu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016; B.M.C.

The use of biochar reduces nutrient losses (low confidence) (Woolf et al., 2010), enhances fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency and improves the bioavailability of phosphorus (Figure 5.36; Clough et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2016; Z.

Biochar addition may decrease methane (CH4) emissions in inundated and acid soils such as rice fields (low confidence)(Jeffery et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). In non-inundated, neutral soils, CH4 uptake from the atmosphere is suppressed after biochar application (low confidence) (Jeffery et al., 2016), and soil N2O emissions decline (medium confidence) (Cayuela et al., 2014; Kammann et al., 2017). The potential risks of introducing harmful contaminants into the soil environment are not well understood (Lorenz and Lal, 2014). With low confidence, application of biochar can have co-benefits for soil microbial biodiversity (P. Smith et al., 2018), while the potential trade-offs for biodiversity are due to land requirements (Tisserant and Cherubini, 2019)."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Peatlands are less extensive than forests, croplands and grazing lands, yet per unit area, they hold high carbon stocks (Griscom et al., 2017). Peatland restoration relies on back-conversion or building of high-carbon-density soils through flooding – that is, rewetting (Leifeld et al., 2019). High water level and anoxic conditions are prerequisites for restoring by returning drained and/or degraded peatlands back to their natural state as CO2 sinks, but restoration also results in enhanced CH4 emissions which are similar to or higher than the pre-drainage fluxes (high  confidence) (Koskinen et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016a; Hemes et al., 2019; Renou-Wilson et al., 2019; Holl et al., 2020). In a multi-decadal time frame, the reduction in CO2 emissions from rewetting more than compensates for the initial increase in radiative forcing due to enhanced CH4 emissions (Günther et al., 2020). Rewetting drained peatlands will decrease N2O emissions (medium confidence) (Wilson et al., 2016b; H. Liu et al., 2020; Tiemeyer et al., 2020). Restored wetlands and peatlands act as buffer zones that provide infiltration and nutrient retention and offer protection to water quality (Daneshvar et al., 2017; Lundin et al., 2017), particularly in nutrient-loaded agricultural catchments. Peatland restoration can also recover much of the original biodiversity (medium confidence) (Meli et al., 2014; P. Smith et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"The concept of BECCS rests on the premise that bioenergy production is carbon neutral – that is, as much CO2 is sequestered when growing biomass as feedstock as is released by its combustion. If these emissions are also captured and stored, the net effect is removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (Fuss et al., 2018). Sequestration potentials from BECCS depend strongly on the feedstock, climate, and management practices (Beringer et al., 2011; Kato and Yamagata, 2014; Heck et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017). If woody bioenergy plants replace marginal land, net carbon uptake increases, enriching soil carbon (Don et al., 2012; Heck et al., 2016; Boysen et al., 2017a, b). However, replacing carbon-rich ecosystems with herbaceous bioenergy plants could deplete soil-carbon stocks and reduce the additional sink capacity of standing forests (Don et al., 2012; Harper et al., 2018). Furthermore, wood-based BECCS may not be carbon negative in the first decades, initially emitting more CO2 than sequestering (Sterman et al., 2018). BECCS has several trade-offs to deal with, including possible threats to water supply and soil nutrient deficiencies (medium confidence) (SRCCL Chapters 2 and 6, and Cross-Chapter Box 5.1; Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017; de Coninck et al., 2018; Heck et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018). Deployment of BECCS at the scales envisioned by many 1.5°C–2.0°C mitigation scenarios could threaten biodiversity and require large land areas, competing with afforestation, reforestation and food security (Anderson and Peters, 2016; P. Smith et al., 2018). Additional risks and side effects are related to geologic carbon storage (Fuss et al., 2018; see also Section 5.6.2.2.4)."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"In conclusion, land-based CDR methods that rely on enhanced net biological uptake and storage of carbon, have a wide range of biogeochemical and biophysical side effects. These side effects can (directly or indirectly) strengthen or weaken the climate change mitigation effect of a given method, or affect water quality and quantity, food supply and biodiversity (Figure 5.36). With the exception of weakened ocean carbon sequestration, there is low confidence in the Earth system feedbacks of these methods. Most methods are associated with a range of biogeochemical and biophysical side effects and co-benefits and trade-offs, but these are often highly dependent on local context, management regime, prior land use, and scale (high confidence). Highest co-benefits are obtained with methods that seek to restore natural ecosystems and improve soil carbon sequestration (Figure 5.36) while highest trade-off possibilities (symmetry with the highest co-benefits) occur for reforestation or afforestation with monocultures and BECCS, again with strong dependence on scale and context (medium confidence)."

However, the ocean physical processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, such as large-scale circulation, cannot be feasibly altered, so ocean CDR methods focus on increasing the productivity of ocean ecosystems, and subsequent sequestration of carbon (GESAMP, 2019). There has been no change to the assessment of SROCC (SROCCSection 5.5.1): there is low confidence that nutrient addition to the open ocean, either through artificial ocean upwelling or iron fertilization, could contribute to climate change mitigation, due to its inconclusive effect on carbon sequestration and risks of adverse side effects on marine ecosystems (Figure 5.36, Table 5.9; Supplementary Materials Text 5.SM.3 and Table 5.SM.4; AR6 WGIII Chapter 12; Gattuso et al., 2018; Boyd and Vivian, 2019; Feng et al., 2020).

wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems (sometimes referred to as ‘blue carbon’ – see Glossary) refers to the potential for increasing carbon sequestration by plant growth and burial of organic carbon in the soil of coastal wetlands (including salt marshes and mangroves) and seagrass ecosystems. Wider usage of the term blue carbon occurs in the literature, for example, including seaweeds (macroalgae), shelf sea sediments and open ocean carbon exchanges. However, such systems are less amenable to management, with many uncertainties relating to the permanence of their carbon stores (Windham-Myers et al., 2018; Lovelock and Duarte, 2019; SROCC, Section 5.5.1.1)."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows store significant amounts of carbon and are among the most productive ecosystems per unit area (Griscom et al., 2017, 2020; Ortega et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2019). These rates could be reduced in the future, since these habitats are vulnerable to changing conditions, such as temperature, salinity, sediment supply, storm severity and continued coastal development (Bindoff et al., 2019; NASEM, 2019). These ecosystems are under threat from anthropogenic conversion and degradation and are being lost at rates between 0.7% and 7% per annum with consequent CO2 emissions (e.g., Atwood et al., 2017; Howard et al., 2017; Hamilton and Friess, 2018; Sasmito et al., 2019). Although sea level rise might lead to greater carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands (Rogers et al., 2019), there is  high confidence that the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves will increase (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1; Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; Laufkötter et al., 2020),which poses a more immediate threat to the integrity of coastal carbon stocks (Smale et al., 2019). Blue carbon restoration seeks to increase the rate of carbon sequestration, although restoration may be challenging, because of ongoing use of coastal land for human settlement, conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, shoreline hardening and port development."

Weathering is accelerated by spreading ground rocks on soils, coasts or oceans. EW increases the alkalinity and pH of natural waters, helps dampen ocean acidification and increases ocean carbon uptake (Beerling et al., 2018). The dissolution of minerals stimulates biological productivity of croplands (Hartmann et al., 2013; Beerling et al., 2018), but can also liberate toxic trace metals (such as nickel, chromium, copper) into soil or water bodies (Keller et al., 2018a; Strefler et al., 2018). EW can also contribute to freshwater salinization as a result of increased salt inputs and cation exchange in watersheds, and so adversely affecting drinking water quality (low confidence) (Kaushal et al., 2018). With amedium confidence, amendment of soils with minerals will have lower N2O emissions (Kantola et al., 2017; Blanc-Betes et al., 2020) but will not have a marked effect on evapotranspiration or albedo (Fuss et al., 2018; de Oliveira Garcia et al., 2020). The mining of minerals can cause adverse impacts on biodiversity, however, the use of waste materials such as concrete demolition or steel slags for EW can reduce the need for mining (Renforth, 2019).

Ocean alkalinization ameliorates surface ocean acidification (high confidence) (Hauck et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2020), but there are also negative side effects on the marine ecosystem, most of which are poorly understood or quantified (Figure 5.36 and Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.4; Bach et al., 2019).

Different DAC methods have been proposed, which differ by the chemical process used to capture the CO2 and to recover it from the sorbent or solvent (NASEM, 2019). The captured CO2 may be either stored geologically as a high-pressure gas or sequestered by a mineral carbonation process. Storage is potentially permanent in both pressurised gas and mineral form (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS has significant requirements of energy and, (depending on the type of technology), water and materials (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Compared to other CDR methods, it has a small land footprint (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Side effects of DACCS include CO2 -depleted air leaving the air contactor, which could have adverse effects on crop and ecosystem productivity, and VOC emissions (NASEM, 2019). Additional risks and side effects are related to the high pressure at which CO2 is stored in geologic formations (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS is assessed in detail in WGIII Chapter 12."

CH4 removal methods seek to capture CH4 directly from ambient air, similarly to DACCS for CO2 using, for example, zeolite trapping, but instead of storing it, CH4 would be chemically oxidized to CO2 (Jackson et al., 2019). Methane can be also removed microbially by supporting naturally occurring processes, such as by enhancing the soil microbial uptake through afforestation (J. Wu et al., 2018) or by directing the venting air from a cow barn into the soil bed of a nearby greenhouse, utilizing microbial CH4 oxidation (Nisbet et al., 2020). Microbial CH4 oxidation could also be used for removal of CH4 leaked from point sources by building biocatalytic polymers which include methane-oxidizing enzymes (Blanchette et al., 2016). Methane removal is, however, still in its infancy and the available literature is insufficient for an assessment."

Different DAC methods have been proposed, which differ by the chemical process used to capture the CO2 and to recover it from the sorbent or solvent (NASEM, 2019). The captured CO2 may be either stored geologically as a high-pressure gas or sequestered by a mineral carbonation process. Storage is potentially permanent in both pressurised gas and mineral form (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS has significant requirements of energy and, (depending on the type of technology), water and materials (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Compared to other CDR methods, it has a small land footprint (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Side effects of DACCS include CO2 -depleted air leaving the air contactor, which could have adverse effects on crop and ecosystem productivity, and VOC emissions (NASEM, 2019).

Methane can be also removed microbially by supporting naturally occurring processes, such as by enhancing the soil microbial uptake through afforestation (J. Wu et al., 2018) or by directing the venting air from a cow barn into the soil bed of a nearby greenhouse, utilizing microbial CH4 oxidation (Nisbet et al., 2020).

However, the ocean physical processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, such as large-scale circulation, cannot be feasibly altered, so ocean CDR methods focus on increasing the productivity of ocean ecosystems, and subsequent sequestration of carbon (GESAMP, 2019). There has been no change to the assessment of SROCC (SROCCSection 5.5.1): there is low confidence that nutrient addition to the open ocean, either through artificial ocean upwelling or iron fertilization, could contribute to climate change mitigation, due to its inconclusive effect on carbon sequestration and risks of adverse side effects on marine ecosystems (Figure 5.36, Table 5.9; Supplementary Materials Text 5.SM.3 and Table 5.SM.4; AR6 WGIII Chapter 12; Gattuso et al., 2018; Boyd and Vivian, 2019; Feng et al., 2020).

wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems (sometimes referred to as ‘blue carbon’ – see Glossary) refers to the potential for increasing carbon sequestration by plant growth and burial of organic carbon in the soil of coastal wetlands (including salt marshes and mangroves) and seagrass ecosystems. Wider usage of the term blue carbon occurs in the literature, for example, including seaweeds (macroalgae), shelf sea sediments and open ocean carbon exchanges. However, such systems are less amenable to management, with many uncertainties relating to the permanence of their carbon stores (Windham-Myers et al., 2018; Lovelock and Duarte, 2019; SROCC, Section 5.5.1.1)."

These rates could be reduced in the future, since these habitats are vulnerable to changing conditions, such as temperature, salinity, sediment supply, storm severity and continued coastal development (Bindoff et al., 2019; NASEM, 2019). These ecosystems are under threat from anthropogenic conversion and degradation and are being lost at rates between 0.7% and 7% per annum with consequent CO2 emissions (e.g., Atwood et al., 2017; Howard et al., 2017; Hamilton and Friess, 2018; Sasmito et al., 2019). Although sea level rise might lead to greater carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands (Rogers et al., 2019), there is  high confidence that the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves will increase (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1; Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; Laufkötter et al., 2020),which poses a more immediate threat to the integrity of coastal carbon stocks (Smale et al., 2019). Blue carbon restoration seeks to increase the rate of carbon sequestration, although restoration may be challenging, because of ongoing use of coastal land for human settlement, conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, shoreline hardening and port development."

While coastal habitat restoration potentially provides significant mitigation of national emissions for some countries (Taillardat et al., 2018; Serrano et al., 2019), the global sequestration potential of blue carbon approaches is <0.02 PgC yr–1 (medium confidence) (Figure 5.36; SROCC, Section 5.5.1.2; Griscom et al., 2017; Gattuso et al., 2018; GESAMP, 2019; NASEM, 2019)."

Weathering is accelerated by spreading ground rocks on soils, coasts or oceans. EW increases the alkalinity and pH of natural waters, helps dampen ocean acidification and increases ocean carbon uptake (Beerling et al., 2018). The dissolution of minerals stimulates biological productivity of croplands (Hartmann et al., 2013; Beerling et al., 2018), but can also liberate toxic trace metals (such as nickel, chromium, copper) into soil or water bodies (Keller et al., 2018a; Strefler et al., 2018). EW can also contribute to freshwater salinization as a result of increased salt inputs and cation exchange in watersheds, and so adversely affecting drinking water quality (low confidence) (Kaushal et al., 2018). With amedium confidence, amendment of soils with minerals will have lower N2O emissions (Kantola et al., 2017; Blanc-Betes et al., 2020) but will not have a marked effect on evapotranspiration or albedo (Fuss et al., 2018; de Oliveira Garcia et al., 2020). The mining of minerals can cause adverse impacts on biodiversity, however, the use of waste materials such as concrete demolition or steel slags for EW can reduce the need for mining (Renforth, 2019). The spreading of minerals on land has a neutral impact on biodiversity (P. Smith et al., 2018)."

Ocean alkalinization ameliorates surface ocean acidification (high confidence) (Hauck et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2020), but there are also negative side effects on the marine ecosystem, most of which are poorly understood or quantified (Figure 5.36 and Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.4; Bach et al., 2019). Although ocean alkalinization could potentially sequester large amounts of carbon (≥1 PgC yr–1; Figure 5.36; and Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.5) there is no new evidence to revisit the SROCC (SROCCSection 5.5.1.2.4) conclusion that there is low confidence that ocean alkalinization is a viable climate change mitigation approach."
wg1_ch05_5.6.2.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Direct air carbon capture with carbon storage (DACCS) is a combination of two techniques, direct capture of CO2 from ambient air (DAC) and carbon storage. DAC entails contacting the air, capturing the CO2 on a liquid solvent or solid sorbent, and regenerating the solvent or sorbent. Different DAC methods have been proposed, which differ by the chemical process used to capture the CO2 and to recover it from the sorbent or solvent (NASEM, 2019). The captured CO2 may be either stored geologically as a high-pressure gas or sequestered by a mineral carbonation process. Storage is potentially permanent in both pressurised gas and mineral form (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS has significant requirements of energy and, (depending on the type of technology), water and materials (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Compared to other CDR methods, it has a small land footprint (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Side effects of DACCS include CO2 -depleted air leaving the air contactor, which could have adverse effects on crop and ecosystem productivity, and VOC emissions (NASEM, 2019). Additional risks and side effects are related to the high pressure at which CO2 is stored in geologic formations (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS is assessed in detail in WGIII Chapter 12."

CH4 removal methods seek to capture CH4 directly from ambient air, similarly to DACCS for CO2 using, for example, zeolite trapping, but instead of storing it, CH4 would be chemically oxidized to CO2 (Jackson et al., 2019). Methane can be also removed microbially by supporting naturally occurring processes, such as by enhancing the soil microbial uptake through afforestation (J. Wu et al., 2018) or by directing the venting air from a cow barn into the soil bed of a nearby greenhouse, utilizing microbial CH4 oxidation (Nisbet et al., 2020). Microbial CH4 oxidation could also be used for removal of CH4 leaked from point sources by building biocatalytic polymers which include methane-oxidizing enzymes (Blanchette et al., 2016). Methane removal is, however, still in its infancy and the available literature is insufficient for an assessment."

The SRM options and the physical climate response to SRM is assessed in detail in Section 4.6.3 and Table 4.7. Section 6.3.6 assesses the potential effective radiative forcing of aerosol-based SRM options and Section 8.6.3 assesses the abrupt water cycle changes in response to initiation or termination of SRM. Most literature on the biogeochemical responses to SRM focuses on stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), and only a few studies have investigated the biogeochemical responses to marine cloud brightening (MCB) and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT). At the time of AR5, there were only a few studies on the biogeochemical responses to SRM. The main assessment of AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) was that SRM will not interfere with the direct biogeochemical effects of increased CO2, such as ocean acidification and CO2 fertilization, but could affect the carbon cycle through climate–carbon feedbacks. Overall, AR5 concluded that the level of confidence on the effects of SRM on carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is very low (Ciais et al., 2013). Since AR5, more modelling work has been conducted to examine various aspects of the global biogeochemical cycle responses to SRM."

Net SRM effects on the carbon cycle, relative to a world without SRM, depend on the change of individual factors, and interactions among them."
wg1_ch05_5.6.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"SRM-mediated sunlight changes directly affect the carbon cycle. In particular, SAI would reduce the sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface, but also increase the fraction of sunlight that is diffuse. These changes in the quantity and quality of the sunlight have opposing effects on the photosynthesis of land plants. On their own, reductions in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) will reduce photosynthesis. However, diffuse light is more effective than direct light in accessing the light-limited leaves within plant canopies, leading to the so-called ‘diffuse-radiation’ fertilization effect (Mercado et al., 2009). The estimated balance between the negative impacts of reducing PAR and the positive impacts of increasing diffuse fraction differ between models (Kalidindi et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2016; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020) and across different ecosystems. The change in the absolute amount of direct and diffuse radiation could also depend on the height of the additional sulphate aerosol layer in the stratosphere and the hygroscopic growth of aerosols (Krishnamohan et al., 2019, 2020)."

Relative to a high-GHG world without SRM, the simulated responses of net primary production (NPP) to SRM differ widely between models, such that even the sign of global mean change is uncertain (Glienke et al., 2015). SRM-induced cooling would decrease NPP at high latitudes by reducing the length of the growing season (Glienke et al., 2015). At low latitudes, the NPP response to SRM-induced cooling is sensitive to the effect of nitrogen limitation (Glienke et al., 2015; Duan et al., 2020). SRM-induced cooling tends to increase NPP in models without the nitrogen cycle because of reduced heat stress. However, in models including the nitrogen cycle, this is counteracted by reductions in NPP because of reductions in nitrogen mineralization and nitrogen availability (Glienke et al., 2015). SRM-induced changes in the hydrological cycle (Section 8.6.3), including changes in evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture, also pose strong constraints on the vegetation response (Dagon and Schrag, 2019). For the same amount of global mean cooling, different SRM options, such as SAI, MCB, and CCT, would have different effects on gross primary production (GPP) and NPP because of different spatial patterns of temperature, available sunlight and hydrological cycle changes (Section 4.6.3.3) (Duan et al., 2020). Modelling studies show that SRM-induced cooling would reduce plant and soil respiration (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et al., 2018; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020).

However, reductions in light availability will produce a counteracting reduction in crop yields, especially if the crop type does not benefit appreciably from diffuse-light fertilization (Proctor et al., 2018). The balance between these effects varies markedly across crop types and regions, from projected increases in maize production in China (Xia et al., 2014) to reductions in groundnut yields in parts of India (Yang et al., 2016). Because of these diverging results from a limited set of studies, there is overall low confidence in the effect of SRM on crop yields."

As a result of enhanced global carbon uptake, SRM would reduce the burden of atmospheric CO2 (high confidence). However, the amount of SRM-induced reduction in atmospheric CO2 depends on the future emissions scenario and modelled oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks, which differ widely between models (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et al., 2018). Models that include the terrestrial nitrogen cycle usually report a much smaller reduction of atmospheric CO2 in response to SRM than models without the nitrogen cycle, mainly because nitrogen limitation leads to a weaker terrestrial carbon sink (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; C.-E.

However, observations show that the processes underlying this uptake are beginning to respond to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere and climate change in a way that will weaken nature’s capacity to take up CO2 in the future.

Most often, the term refers to the total net amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that can still be emitted by human activities while limiting global warming to a specified level (e.g., 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels). This is referred to as the ‘remaining carbon budget’. Several choices and value judgements have to be made before it can be unambiguously estimated. When the remaining carbon budget is combined with all past CO2 emissions to date, a ‘total carbon budget’ compatible with a specific global warming limit can also be defined. A third type of carbon budget is the ‘historical carbon budget’, which is a scientific way to describe all past and present sources and sinks of CO2. "
