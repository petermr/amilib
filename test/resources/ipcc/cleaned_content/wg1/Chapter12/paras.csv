wg1_ch12_12.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change is already resulting in significant societal and environmental impacts and will induce major socio-economic damages in the future (AR5 WGII). The society, at large, benefits from information related to climate change risks, which enables the development of options to protect lives, preserve nature, build resilience and prevent avoidable loss and damage. Climate change can also lead to beneficial conditions that can be taken into account in adaptation strategies."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Impacts of climate change are driven not only by changes in climate conditions, but also by changes in exposure and vulnerability (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3). This chapter concentrates on drivers of impacts that are of climatic origin (see also the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5, IPCC, 2018), and Section 1.3.2 in this Report), referred to in WGI as ‘climatic impact-drivers’ (CIDs). CIDs are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. However, this chapter largely focuses on drivers commonly connected to hazards, and adopts the IPCC risk framework (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3) since the main objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to ‘prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’ (Article 2)."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"In some cases, risk assessments may require climate information beyond the CIDs identified in this chapter, with further impacts or risk modelling often driven by historical climate forcing datasets (e.g., Ruane et al., 2021) and full climate scenario time series (e.g., Lange, 2019) produced using methods described in Chapter 10. Chapter 12 focuses on the assessment of a finite number of drivers and how they are projected to evolve with climate change, in order to inform impact and risk assessments."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"This chapter is new in IPCC WGI assessment reports, in that it represents a contribution to the ‘IPCC risk framework’. Within this framework, climate-related impacts and risks are determined through an interplay between the occurrence of climate hazards and their consequences depending on the exposure of the affected human or natural system and its vulnerability to the hazardous conditions. In Chapter 12, we are assessing climatic impact-drivers that could lead to hazards or to opportunities, from the literature and model results since AR5. This will particularly support the assessment of key risks related to climate change by WGII (Chapter 16). Despite the fact that impacts may also be induced by climate adaptation and mitigation policies themselves, as well as by socio-economic trends, changes in vulnerability or exposure, and external geophysical hazards such as volcanoes, the focus here is only on climatic impacts and risks induced by shifts in physical climate phenomena that directly influence human and ecological systems (Cross-chapter Box 1.3)."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p6,NO_TITLE,This chapter follows the terminology associated with the framing introduced in Chapter 1 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) and as found in Annex VII: Glossary. The highlighted terms below are introduced and used extensively in this chapter:
wg1_ch12_12.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"The approach adopted here is consistent with the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, which aims to face disaster consequences (including but not limited to climate disasters) and reduce risks in natural, managed and built environments (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2015; UNISDR, 2015). The classification of climatic impact-drivers in this chapter is largely consistent with the classification of hazards used in the Sendai Framework. However, the UNISDR hazard list spans a wider range of hazards inducing damage to society, including hazards that are not directly related to climate (such as volcanoes and earthquakes), which are excluded from the assessment herein. Furthermore, the UNISDR classification of hazards does not include mean climatic conditions, which are also discussed as climatic impact-drivers in this chapter. The first priority mentioned in the Sendai Framework is understanding disaster risk as a necessary step for action. Facilitating such an understanding is a clear goal of this chapter."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"The chapter adopts a regional perspective (continental regions as defined in Chapter 1 and used in WGII; see Figure 1.18) on climatic impact-drivers to support decision-making across a wide audience of global and regional stakeholders in addition to governments (e.g., civil society organizations, public and private sectors, academia). While the focus here is on future changes, it also describes current levels and observed trends of CIDs as an important point of reference for informing adaptation strategies."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Figure 12.1 summarizes the rationale behind (Chapter 12 as the linkage (also referred to as a ‘handshake’) between WGI and WGII, illustrating how the changing profile of risk may be informed by an assessment of climatic impact-drivers, aligning WGI findings on physical climate change with WGII needs. The implementation of mitigation policy shifts may modulate hazard probability changes (i.e., by reducing emissions to limit global warming) as well as regional vulnerability and exposure. The assessment herein is organized around regional climatic impact-drivers, but also relates key indices and thresholds to increasing global drivers (such as mean surface warming) as a contribution to the assessment of ‘Reasons for Concern’ in WGII (O’Neill et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p12,NO_TITLE,"The narrative of (Chapter 12 is illustrated in Figure 12.2. First, Section 12.2 defines a range of climatic impact-driver categories that are relevant for regional and sectoral impacts. Next, Section 12.3 identifies climatic impact-drivers and their relevant indices that are frequently used in the context of climate impacts in the WGII focus sectors (AR6 WGII Chapters 2–8). The assessment of changes in regional-scale climatic impact-drivers is then developed within Section 12.4 by continent, following the structure of the WGII assessment report regional chapters (AR6 WGII Chapters 9–15), and adding the polar regions, open/deep ocean and other specific zones corresponding to the WGII Cross-Chapter Papers. Section 12.5 then presents a global perspective (both bottom-up and top-down) on the change of regional climatic impact-drivers, including an assessment of the ‘emergence’ of climatic impact-drivers. Section 12.6 discusses how climate information is used in ‘climate services’, which encompasses a range of activities bridging climate science and its use for adaptation and mitigation decision-making (see also AR6 WGII Chapter 17). The chapter concludes with final remarks in Section 12.7."
wg1_ch12_12.1_p14,NO_TITLE,"The chapter includes two Cross-Chapter Boxes. Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 connects climatic impact-drivers to global climate drivers and levels of warming as an element of the ‘Reasons for Concern’ framework (AR6 WGII Chapter 16). An additional Cross-Chapter Box, including three case studies from Europe, Asia and Africa, describes how climate services draw upon and apply regional climate information to support stakeholder decisions (Cross-Chapter Box 12.2)."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"This section details the methodological approach followed in Chapter 12 and discusses the underlying rationale for the assessments presented herein. Scientific literature on vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation (as typically asssessed in IPCC WGII) is examined to identify relevant climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) that contribute to sectoral risks and opportunities. Projected changes in corresponding CID indices are then derived from existing literature on changes in the physical climate system, results of other AR6 WGI chapters, and direct calculations based on climate projections from several model ensembles."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The classification of climatic impact-drivers, the ways that they change (e.g., their magnitude or intensity, duration, frequency, timing and spatial extent) is described in this section. It is emphasized that this chapter assesses literature relating only to physical climatic impact-drivers, not their impacts on human systems or the environment. Thus, here we do not consider indicators including exposure or vulnerability as assessed by WGII, although the selection of climatic impact-drivers is informed by literature feeding into WGII."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p3,NO_TITLE,(Chapter 12 assesses climate change information relevant for regional impact and for risk assessment in the seven main sectors corresponding to Chapters 2–8 of the WGII Assessment Report:
wg1_ch12_12.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Many of these sectors also include assets affected by climate change that are important for recreation and tourism, including elements of ecosystems services, health and well-being, communities, livelihoods and sustainable development (see also Chapter 1 on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and the IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL; Hurlbert et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c))."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"CIDs can be captured in seven main types: heat and cold; wet and dry; wind; snow and ice; coastal; oceanic and other. Table 12.1 provides an overview of the seven CID types and the CID categories associated with each type. The type ‘Other’ comprises additional CIDs that are not encompassed within the other six CID types, including air pollution weather (e.g., meteorological conditions that favour high concentrations of surface ozone, particulate matter or other air pollutants), near-surface atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and mean radiation forcing at the surface (which are, for example, relevant for plant growth). Icebergs, fog and lightning are also noted in this chapter but are not broadly assessed across all subsections. In addition, there can be changes in impacts associated with earthquakes that interact with climate variables and climate change, such as liquefaction (e.g., Yasuhara et al., 2012) during earthquakes, or earthquakes caused by snow and water changes (Amos et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2017), which are secondary effects on geophysical hazards that are not further assessed in this chapter. The characteristics and physical description of the climate phenomena or essential climate variables associated with each of these CID categories are assessed and described in previous Chapters 2–11 or (Chapter 12 directly as indicated in Table 12.1. The CID categories are further mapped on to different sectors in Section 12.3 (Table 12.2)."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Potential changes in the seasonality of CIDs or the length and characteristics of seasons (e.g., changes in growing season length or pollen season) are also important as they may shift the timing of many CIDs with broad implications for sectors and regional stakeholders (Wanders and Wada, 2015; Cassou and Cattiaux, 2016; Hansen and Sato, 2016; Brönnimann et al., 2018; Marelle et al., 2018; Unterberger et al., 2018; Kuriqi et al., 2020). Episodic CIDs characterize impact-relevant conditions persisting from short to long time frames but eventually returning to normal conditions."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"In some situations, phenomena causing severe impacts go well beyond a single extreme event or a single climate variable, and can include interaction of climatic conditions, such as sea level rise and storm surge (Wahl et al., 2015), precipitation in combination with strong winds (Martius et al., 2016) or flooding quickly followed by a heatwave (S.S.-Y. Wang et al., 2019; see also Section 10.5.2.4). Such compound events, particularly in the context of climate extremes, are assessed in Section 11.8. A combination of non-extreme climatic impact-drivers in time or space can also lead to severe impacts (Cutter, 2018)."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Several climatic impact-drivers are reliant on many factors beyond their associated primary climatic phenomenon. For example, river flooding is heavily dependent on river management and engineering and could also be affected by tidal water levels due to sea level rise and/or storm surge. Coastal flooding could be affected by coastal protection structures, port and harbour structures, as well as river flows (on inlet-interrupted coasts). Coastal erosion could be influenced by coastal protection measures as well as fluvial sediment supply to the coast. Furthermore, air pollution weather is not the only or dominant driver, for instance, of surface ozone pollution, but precursor emissions from anthropogenic sources can play a significant role (Section 6.5). Chapter 12 focuses only on the influence of the atmospheric, land and oceanic conditions associated with the climatic impact-drivers and the confidence in the direction of CID changes given here does not take into account existing or potential future adaptation measures, unless otherwise stated."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"For each CID category there can be a range of indices that capture the sector- or application-relevant characteristics of a climatic impact-driver as described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4. Indices for climatic impact-drivers that are based on absolute or percentile thresholds (e.g., daily maximum temperature above 35°C) can be affected by biases in climate model simulations, such as local or regional deviations of a simulated climate variable from observed values (Sillmann et al., 2014; Dosio, 2016). Where sensible (i.e., where reliable observational data are available and a climate model that fits for the desired purpose), the output of climate model simulations can be bias-adjusted, potentially involving advanced methods to account for multiple variables and extreme value statistics as assessed in detail in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2. Yet, there is no general agreement about which bias adjustment methods to apply, as artefacts can arise both from the climate model and from the bias adjustment method, and the number of available methods has considerably grown in recent years (for a detailed discussion of available methods and their performance see Sections 10.3.1.3.2 and 10.3.3.7.2, and Cross-Chapter Box 10.2). The WGI Interactive Atlas illustrates original and bias-adjusted CIDs (see Atlas.1.4.5)."
wg1_ch12_12.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"A global perspective on climatic impact-drivers is provided in Section 12.5.1. Section 12.5.2 focuses on assessing evidence for the emergence (Section 1.4.2.2) of an anthropogenic climate change signal on the change in CIDs beyond natural climate variability, based on the literature assessed in other chapters and additional literature, at both global and regional scales. The process of generating user-relevant regional climate information in the context of co-production and climate services is assessed in Sections 10.5, 12.6, Box 10.2 and Cross-Chapter Boxes 10.3 and 12.2. Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 provides a global perspective on climatic impact-drivers related to their evolution for different GWLs (Section 1.6)."
wg1_ch12_12.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change becomes relevant for regional impact management and for risk assessment when changes in mean conditions or episodic events affect natural and societal assets (system components with socio-economic, cultural or intrinsic value) positively or negatively (Table 12.2). Decision makers, policymakers, risk managers and engineers therefore benefit from climate information that tracks key trends and exceedance of thresholds that represent crucial challenges for natural and human systems. While useful indices can vary widely for a given sector and precise tolerance threshold values are often unknown, common metrics, categories and progressions of threshold levels allow experts to recognize coherent messages concerning altered regional impacts and risk profiles under climate change."
wg1_ch12_12.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"This section surveys the links between CIDs and affected sectors; not to perform specific climate change impact or risk assessments (see AR6 WGII), but to describe key indices (among many) that quantify these links as guidance for stakeholders seeking applicable climate information. This survey builds on the work of the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Sector-Specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) and previous IPCC assessments, notably AR5 WGII (Birkmann et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014a) and IPCC Special Reports (IPCC, 2018, 2019b, c) that have assessed climate hazards affecting sectors but is organized from a CID perspective drawing also upon recent summaries of sectoral hazards (Mora et al., 2018; ICOMOS, 2019; Yokohata et al., 2019). Impacts, risks and opportunities are rarely attributable to a single CID index or threshold, but climate shifts that push conditions outside of expected conditions and beyond tolerance levels are indicative of impact, risk or benefit given vulnerability and exposure. Focus is on direct sectoral connections of a CID (Hallegatte and Przyluski, 2010) rather than cascading or secondary effects (e.g., water-borne diseases following a flood, mental health challenges following a severe storm, or the effects of drought on poverty), as these are strongly affected by exposure, vulnerability and response, as discussed in the WGII Report."
wg1_ch12_12.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Table 12.2 presents a summary of (Section 12.3 connections between CIDs as defined in Table 12.1 and key sectoral assets, utilizing the WGII organization of sectors (corresponding to WGII Chapters 2–8). Colours are shown for connections with at least medium confidence as assessed from sectoral impacts and risk literature, with relevance assessed according to the prominence of that specific CID/asset connection in analyses of current and future impacts and risk. Within each sector there is a multitude of specific sectoral systems that may be affected by CID increases and decreases, with consequences further distinguished by region, background climate and socio-economic or ecological context of the affected asset. Our aim is therefore to recognize important drivers and the common attributes of change within each CID that scientists and practitioners monitor to understand current and future challenges for important asset groups, thereby pointing to the climate information that needs to be tailored and analysed for impacts and for risk assessment (Section 12.6). Additional effects whereby CIDs affect each other (across Table 12.2 columns) are discussed as climatic phenomena within WGI. The ways sectoral assets affect each other (across Table 12.2 rows) are described throughout WGII, for example with information about the suitability of future climate zones and climate velocity challenges for a given asset potentially drawing from multiple CIDs and associated system tolerance thresholds (Hamann et al., 2015). Some broad connections indicated as low confidence may be under-represented in the literature or could be acute under specific circumstances."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Information about increasing mean annual and seasonal air temperature is relevant in the determination of suitable species range for terrestrial, freshwater and intertidal species (Thomas et al., 2004; Elith et al., 2010; Hincapie and Caicedo, 2013; Cooper, 2014; Krist et al., 2014; Lindner et al., 2014; Saintilan et al., 2014; Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Myers-Smith et al., 2015; Urban, 2015; Thorne et al., 2017). Ocean ecosystems are affected by the ocean temperature CID (described in Section 12.3.6.1). Species redistribution and extinction studies also need information about climate velocity, a comparison of the pace of warming to geographical temperature gradients that indicates the rate at which a species would have to move to maintain its climatological temperature (Thomas et al., 2004; Loarie et al., 2009; Dobrowski et al., 2013; Burrows et al., 2014; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016; Sittaro et al., 2017) with some studies incorporating additional variables beyond temperature (Hamann et al., 2015). Many freshwater ecosystems are strongly constrained by stream and lake temperatures (Scheurer et al., 2009; Comte and Grenouillet, 2013; Contador et al., 2014; Knouft and Ficklin, 2017). Warmer and more stratified lake temperatures are more conducive to cyanobacteria blooms with implications for ecosystem health and water resource quality (Whitehead et al., 2009; Moss et al., 2011; Jones and Brett, 2014; Chapra et al., 2017; Shatwell et al., 2019). Consideration of nighttime and daytime temperature trends also elucidates different biophysical effects on vegetation (Peng et al., 2013). Changes in the seasonal timing caused by warming trends are critical to species ranges and ecosystem function (Pearce-Higgins et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 2017b), and indices that characterize the onset of spring shed light on plant emergence and development (Ault et al., 2015)."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Mean air temperature dictates many aspects of crop cultivation, livestock production, agroforestry and output from freshwater aquaculture and fisheries, as well as the potential for food contamination. Mean warming alters suitable cultivation zones for crop species (Bragança et al., 2016; Gendron St-Marseille et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c) and tree species (Hanewinkel et al., 2013; Fei et al., 2017). Crop and ecosystem service productivity often responds directly to mean temperatures, although this is dependent on farming systems (Bassu et al., 2014; Challinor et al., 2014; Lobell and Tebaldi, 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Asseng et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Fleisher et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Smith and Fazil, 2019). Many studies relate plant development (phenology), insect generation cycles and pest outbreaks to growing degree days, an aggregation of daily thermal units above a threshold (e.g., Tmean>5°C) that accelerates with warmer conditions (Hof and Svahlin, 2016; Ruosteenoja et al., 2016; Tripathi et al., 2016). Many plants respond to changes in nighttime temperatures that affect respiration and transpiration rates (Narayanan et al., 2015; X. Chen et al., 2019), and warming of the soil column is also relevant to determine plant sprouting (Grotjahn, 2021). A number of indices have been developed to represent the length of the viable local growing season, including a count of days where Tmax>5°C (Mueller et al., 2015) or the period between a year’s first and last set of five consecutive days with a weighted Tmean≥10°C (G. Li et al., 2018). Warmer conditions and altered seasonality modify the range and metabolism of some pollinators, pests, diseases and weeds (Wolfe et al., 2008; Bebber, 2015; Aljaryian and Kumar, 2016; IPBES, 2016; Ramesh et al., 2017; Deutsch et al., 2018; Nyangiwe et al., 2018) and may reduce the effectiveness of winter storage for farmers and caching species (Sutton et al., 2016)."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Warming raises accumulated seasonal heat indices used in livestock production, especially when humidity is high (Key et al., 2014; Lallo et al., 2018), determines aquaculture suitability and is important for wild fish species migration (Tripathi et al., 2016; Brander et al., 2017). Agricultural planners may also calculate how overall warming trends alter the accumulation of vernalization units or chilling hours for agricultural or horticultural crops (often accumulated temperature deficit below a given daily or hourly threshold; Dennis and Peacock, 2009; Luedeling, 2012; Tripathi et al., 2016; Grotjahn, 2021). Warming in the post-harvest is also important for the determination of spoilage and waste (Stathers et al., 2013) as well as food-borne diseases (Kovats et al., 2004; Mbow et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Warming affects road degradation rates (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012; Espinet et al., 2016) and warming rates inform designs for long-term energy efficiency of buildings (Kalvelage et al., 2014). Mean temperature drives seasonal energy demand, often expressed using winter heating degree days (the accumulated deficit of daily temperatures below a ‘comfortable’ indoor temperature, e.g., 15.5°C) and summer cooling degree days (the accumulated excess of temperature above a ‘comfortable’ level, e.g., 18°C; Spinoni et al., 2015; Arnell et al., 2019). Energy resources may also need information on warming trends to determine suitable zones and overall productivity for biofuels and solar panels, the efficiency of which decreases with higher temperatures (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Wild et al., 2015; Solaun and Cerdá, 2019)."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Health impacts and risk studies compare seasonal temperature conditions to limiting thresholds to understand range shifts and incubation rates for pathogens, disease vectors and zoonotic hosts (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks; Caminade et al., 2012, 2014; Eisen and Moore, 2013; Lima et al., 2016; Ogden, 2017; Monaghan et al., 2018) and warming of surface ocean and lake waters conducive to bacterial outbreaks (Baker-Austin et al., 2013; Jacobs et al., 2015; Vezzulli et al., 2015). Warmer conditions can also affect tourism (Kovács et al., 2017) and impact human health by lengthening the allergy season and increasing pollen concentration (Hamaoui-Laguel et al., 2015; Kinney et al., 2015a; Lake et al., 2017; Upperman et al., 2017; Sapkota et al., 2019; Ziska et al., 2019)."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Impacts and risk assessments utilize a large variety of indices and approaches tailored to evaluate heat impacts on human health (Sanderson et al., 2017; C. Gao et al., 2018; McGregor and Vanos, 2018; Staiger et al., 2019; J. Zhu et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). A mixture of simple and complex heat stress indices often combine extreme temperatures and high humidity to capture human health challenges (Aström et al., 2013; Chow et al., 2016; Dahl et al., 2017a; Im et al., 2017; Coffel et al., 2018; J. Li et al., 2018; Vanos et al., 2020). Different optimum temperatures and extreme heat thresholds based on local distributions are needed to reflect acclimation of different locations and populations (Hajat et al., 2014; WHO, 2014; Kinney et al., 2015b; Russo et al., 2015; Petitti et al., 2016; Dosio, 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Lay et al., 2018; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). Hot and humid heat episodes can be deadly (Mora et al., 2017), are associated with elevated hospital intake (Goldie et al., 2017) and lower safety and productivity of outdoor labourers (Dunne et al., 2013; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Kjellstrom et al., 2016; Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Y. Zhao et al., 2016; Mora et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2018; Orlov et al., 2019). Elevated nighttime temperatures prevent the human body from experiencing relief from heat stress (Zhang et al., 2012) and can be tracked over extended periods of sequential day and night heat extremes (Murage et al., 2017; Mukherjee and Mishra, 2018). Extreme heat also exacerbates asthma, respiratory difficulties and response to airborne allergens such as hay fever (Upperman et al., 2017). Extreme heat affects outdoor exercise such as the use of bike-share facilities (Heaney et al., 2019; Vanos et al., 2020). Large-scale recreational and sporting events such as marathons and tennis tournaments monitor heat extremes when determining the viability of host cities (Smith et al., 2016, 2018)."
wg1_ch12_12.3.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Short-term exposure of crops to temperatures beyond a critical temperature threshold can lead to lower yields and above a limiting temperature threshold, crops may fail altogether (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Lobell et al., 2012, 2013; Gourdji et al., 2013; Deryng et al., 2014; Schauberger et al., 2017; Tesfaye et al., 2017; Vogel et al., 2019). The exact level of these thresholds depends on species, cultivar and farm management (Hatfield and Prueger, 2015; Hatfield et al., 2015; Bisbis et al., 2018; Grotjahn, 2021). The timing of heatwaves is particularly important, as extreme heat is more damaging during critical phenological stages (Teixeira et al., 2013; Eyshi Rezaei et al., 2015; Fontana et al., 2015; B. Wang et al., 2017; Mäkinen et al., 2018). Extreme canopy temperatures, rather than 2 m air temperatures, may be a more robust biophysical indicator of heat impacts on crop production (Siebert et al., 2017). Heat stress indices based upon temperature and humidity determine livestock productivity as well as conception and mortality rates (Key et al., 2014; Dash et al., 2016; Pragna et al., 2016; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017)."

Heat affects transportation infrastructure by warping roads and airport runways (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012) or buckling railways (Dobney et al., 2010; Dépoues, 2017; Chinowsky et al., 2019), and high temperatures reduce air density leading to aircraft take-off weight restrictions (Coffel et al., 2017; Palko, 2017; T.

Gao et al., 2018) and may cause transmission lines to sag or fail (Gupta et al., 2012). Thermal and nuclear electricity plants may be challenged when using warmer river waters for cooling or when mixing waste waters back into waterways without causing ecosystem impacts (Kopytko and Perkins, 2011; van Vliet et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2018).

Agricultural systems planning (e.g., planting calendars, seed selection or the opportunity to double-crop) requires information about the start and end of the frost-free season (Wypych et al., 2017; Wolfe et al., 2018). Crops and wild plants can be directly damaged by frost, but hard or killing frosts (at a threshold several degrees below freezing) can kill crops or lower harvest quality depending on duration (which relates to soil temperature penetration) and plant developmental stage (Crimp et al., 2016a; Cradock-Henry, 2017; G. Li et al., 2018; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Grotjahn, 2021). Earlier disappearance of snow cover reduces natural insulation that protects plants and burrowing animals from hard frost damages (Trnka et al., 2014; Mäkinen et al., 2018). In some cases an early season warm spell may reduce plant hardiness or induce fruit tree flowering that exposes plants to devastating subsequent frost impacts (Hufkens et al., 2012; Hatfield et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2016; Brunner et al., 2018; DeGaetano, 2018; Unterberger et al., 2018; Wolfe et al., 2018).

The altitude of the freezing level also identifies portions of mountain slopes where freeze/thaw transitions or changes in snowpack condition can influence landslide and snow avalanche hazards (Coe et al., 2018). The geographical distribution of frost is also a determining factor in the range of vectors for human diseases such as malaria (X. Zhao et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2020)."

Key transportation routes, built infrastructure and agricultural lands are threatened when floods exceed design standards commonly based around flood magnitudes of a given historic return period (e.g., 1-in-100-year flood event), an annual exceedance probability or precipitation intensity-duration-frequency relationships with key indices (e.g., 10-day cumulative precipitation) related to catchment size and properties (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Dikanski et al., 2016; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; Forzieri et al., 2017; Fluixá-Sanmartín et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019). Floods and high-flow events can scour river beds and elevate silt loads, reducing water quality and accelerating deposition in estuaries and reservoirs (Khan et al., 2018; Parasiewicz et al., 2019). Floods can knock down, drown or wash away crops and livestock, and partially submerged plants can have yield reduction depending on water turbidity and their development stage (Ruane et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2019). Basin snowpack properties may also be important during heavy rain events, as rain-on-snow events can lead to rapid acceleration of flood stages that threaten wildlife and society (Hansen et al., 2014)."

Heavy precipitation may overwhelm city transportation and storm water drainage systems, which are typically designed using intensity-duration-frequency information such as the return periods for 1-, 6- or 24-hour rainfall totals (Kermanshah et al., 2017; Depietri and McPhearson, 2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Courty et al., 2019). Heavy rain events can directly cause leaf loss and damage, or knock over crops, also driving pollutant entrainment and erosion hazards in terrestrial ecosystems and farmland, with downstream ramifications for water quality (Hatfield et al., 2014; Segura et al., 2014; Li and Fang, 2016; Chhetri et al., 2019).

Climate models cannot resolve these complex slope failure processes (nor triggering mechanisms such as earthquakes), so most studies rely on proxies or conditions conducive to slope failure (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Ho et al., 2017). Common indices include precipitation intensity-duration thresholds (Brunetti et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012; Melchiorre and Frattini, 2012) and thresholds related to antecedent wet periods and extreme rainfall intensities (Alvioli et al., 2018; Monsieurs et al., 2019).

Changes in soil moisture and surface water can shift the rate of carbon uptake by ecosystems (Humphrey et al., 2018) and alter suitable climate zones for wild species and agricultural cultivation (Feng and Fu, 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2016a; Schlaepfer et al., 2017; Fatemi et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019c) as well as the prevalence of related pests and pathogen-carrying vectors (Paritsis and Veblen, 2011; Smith et al., 2020). Water table depth, in relation to rooting depth, is also important for farms and forests under dry conditions (Feng et al., 2006). A reduction in water availability (via aridity or hydrological drought) challenges water supplies needed for for municipal, industrial, agriculture and hydropower use (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Schewe et al., 2014; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; van Vliet et al., 2016)."

Drought stress for agriculture and ecosystems is difficult to directly observe, and therefore scientists use a variety of drought indices (Table 11.3), proxy information about changes in precipitation supply and reference evapotranspiration demand, the ratio of actual/potential evapotranspiration or a deficit in available soil water content, particularly at rooting level (Park Williams et al., 2013; Trnka et al., 2014; C.D.

Projections of high wind speed and low humidity (even for just a portion of the day) can also inform studies examining fruit desiccation and rice cracking (Grotjahn, 2021). Drought also raises disease infection rates for West Nile virus (Paull et al., 2017), and the alternation of dry and wet spells induces swelling and shrinkage of clay soils that can lead to sinkholes and destabilize buildings (Hadji et al., 2014)."

Projection of future lightning frequency provides information on an important natural triggering mechanism, particularly when coupled with long-term warming and drying trends (Romps et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2015; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Fuel aridity metrics also help determine vegetative fuel desiccation and therefore the ignitability, flammability and spread of fires when they occur (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). The presence of snow cover can influence the length of the fire season and the penetration of fire danger into new portions of the Arctic tundra (Young et al., 2017; Abatzoglou et al., 2019). Data on the changing characteristics of local wind circulations like the Santa Ana in California shed light on future intensity and spread patterns for fires (Jin et al., 2015).

Severe storms particularly threaten energy infrastructure, with maximum wind speed associated with treefall and breaking of above-ground electrical transmission lines (Ward, 2013; Nik et al., 2020). The profile of heavy wind gusts is also required in the design of skyscrapers (C.-H. Wang et al., 2013) and bridges (Mondoro et al., 2018). Severe storms are difficult to simulate at the relatively coarse spatial scales of Earth system models, thus scientists often project changes by noting areas with increased convective available potential energy (CAPE) and strong low-level wind shear as these are conducive to tornado formation (Diffenbaugh et al., 2013; Tippett et al., 2016; Glazer et al., 2021)."

Local detail may also be provided by tracking the seasonal rain–snow transition line across space and elevation (Berghuijs et al., 2014) (Pierce and Cayan, 2013; Berghuijs et al., 2014; Klos et al., 2014; Musselman et al., 2017)."

The loss of glaciers reduces the thermal consistency of cold streams suitable for some freshwater species (Giersch et al., 2017), and parks and recreation areas may lose appeal as glaciers and seasonal snow cover retreat (Gonzalez et al., 2018; Wang and Zhou, 2019).

Warmer conditions can also affect ecosystems, built infrastructure and water resources through thawing of especially ice-rich permafrost (≥20% ice content) and by thawing of ice wedges (Shiklomanov et al., 2017; Hjort et al., 2018), creation of thermokarst ponds and increased subsurface drainage for polar and high-mountain wetlands (Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016; Farquharson et al., 2019) and the release of water pollutants such as mercury (Burkett, 2011; Schaeffer et al., 2012; Schuster et al., 2018)."

Freezing rain and ice storms can be treacherous for road and air travel (Tamerius et al., 2016), and can knock down power and telecommunication lines if ice accumulation is high (Degelia et al., 2016). Rain-on-snow events can create a solid barrier that hinders wildlife and livestock grazing that is important to indigenous communities (Forbes et al., 2016).

Vertical land motion (i.e., land subsidence) caused by local fluid (gas or groundwater) extraction can also have a large influence on relative sea levels (Minderhoud et al., 2020). Several indices have been suggested to signify coastal inundation, including a threshold when the local land elevation falls below the local mean higher high water (MHHW) that is close to the ‘high tide’ level (Kulp and Strauss, 2019) or a threshold when flooding occurs about once every two weeks (Sweet and Park, 2014; Dahl et al., 2017b).

Plants and aquatic systems particularly respond to changes in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the fraction of diffuse radiation (Proctor et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018; Ryu et al., 2018).

There is emerging literature on many connected extremes and their associated hazards (e.g., climatic conditions that could drive multi-breadbasket failures; Trnka et al., 2019; Kornhuber et al., 2020), but a full accounting is not practical here especially considering the many possible CID combinations and the need to assess how exposed systems would be vulnerable to compound CIDs (assessed in WGII). Table 12.2 is once again instructive here in considering hazard-related storylines, as the multiple CIDs affecting a given sectoral asset (assessing across a row of Table 12.2) point to potentially dangerous hazard combinations. Similarly, change in a single CID has the potential to affect multiple sectoral assets (assessing down a column of Table 12.2) in a manner with broader systemic implications (AR6 WGII)."

In addition, CID indices and thresholds relevant to ‘specific zones’, as defined in AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Papers, are assessed in Section 12.4.10 except for the Mediterranean, which is addressed both under Africa and Europe (Sections 12.4.1 and 12.4.5) and is a focus in Section 10.6.4."
wg1_ch12_12.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Regional assessment method and tables: In each section herein (Sections 12.4.1–12.4.10), we assess changes in sector-relevant CIDs following the main CID categories defined in Section 12.2 through commonly used indices and thresholds relevant for sectors described in 12.3. Sections 12.4.1–12.4.9 each include a summary qualitative CID assessment table (Tables 12.3–12.11) showing the confidence levels associated with the direction of projected CID changes (i.e., increasing or decreasing) for the mid-century period (2041–2060) relative to the recent past, for scenarios RCP4.5, SSP2-4.5, SRES A1B, or above (RCP6.0, RCP8.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5, SRES A2), which approximately encompasses GWLs of 2.0°C to 2.4°C (as best estimate; see Chapter 4, Table 4.5). For scenarios RCP2.6, SSP1-2.6 or SSP1-1.9, the signal may have lower confidence levels in some cases due to smaller overall changes, embedded in a similar internal variability, and to the availability of relatively few studies that account for these scenarios. Nevertheless, CID changes under these lower emissions scenarios are included in the text whenever information is available. For each cell in Tables 12.3–12.11, literature is assessed, aided by global Figure 12.4 or regional Figures 12.5–12.10. Confidence in projections is established considering evidence emerging from observations, attribution and projections, as explained in Cross-Chapter Box 10.3 while considering the amount of evidence and agreement across models and studies and model generations."
wg1_ch12_12.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The confidence levels associated with the directions of projected CID changes are synthesized assessments based on literature that may utilize different indices and baseline periods or projections by GWLs. For extreme heat, cold spell, heavy precipitation and drought CIDs that are assessed in Chapter 11, here we draw projections from the 2°C GWL tables in Section 11.9. In some cases, more details are needed in order to emphasize one aspect of projected CID change. For instance, the change in a CID may be different for intensity, duration, frequency; or there can be strong sub-regional or seasonal signals; or different CID indices may have conflicting signals. A footnote is added in such cases, but a confidence level for a direction of projected change is given based on the Section 12.3 assessment of aspects of regional CID change that are most relevant for impacts and for risks. As an example, tropical cyclones are increasing in intensity but decreasing in frequency in some regions. Here, in assessing the confidence of the direction of projected change in the Tropical cyclone CID (i.e., the colour of the table cell), we assign more weight to the ‘intensity’ rather than the ‘frequency’, corresponding to the higher relevance of the intensity of major tropical cyclones for risk assessment. Low confidence of changes, arising from lack of evidence, strong spatial or seasonal heterogeneity, or lack of agreement, are represented by colour-less cells, and, for the sake of simplicity, only two categories of confidence are given: medium confidence and  high confidence (and higher). In addition, CID assessment tables also indicate observed or projected emergence of the CID change signal from the natural interannual variability if assessed with at least medium confidence in Section 12.5.2, using as a basis a criterion of S/N > 1, noise being defined as the interannual variability. The time of emergence (ToE) is given as either: (i) already emerged in the historical period, or (ii) emerging by 2050 at least for RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5, or (iii) emerging after 2050 but before 2100 at least for scenarios RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5. Table cells that do not include emergence information are indicative of ‘low confidence of emergence in the 21st century’, which includes situations where assessment indicates emergence will not occur before 2100 or that evidence is not available or insufficient for a confidence assessment of time of emergence."

(2019) indicated that both the Southern and Arctic Oceans will experience year-round under-saturation conditions by 2100 under RCP8.5. The vertical level of the aragonite saturation horizon off the Pacific coast of North America has risen towards the surface by 30–50 m since pre-industrial times (Mathis et al., 2015b; Feely et al., 2016). In a study of US coastlines, Ekstrom et al. (2015) mapped out the projected year when aragonite saturation state drops below 1.5 (a sublethal threshold for bivalve mollusc larvae), finding hazardous conditions before 2030 from northern Oregon to Alaska and before 2100 for the Pacific coast and Atlantic coastline north of New Jersey. Mathis et al.

wg1_ch12_12.4_p10,NO_TITLE,"Air pollution weather: The effect of climate change on air quality is assessed in Section 6.5 with limitations for local planning explained in Section 6.1.3, and only a brief summary is given here. Section 6.5 notes that climate change will have a small burden on particulate matter (PM) pollution (medium confidence) while the main controlling factor in determining future concentrations will be future emissions policy for PM and their precursors (high confidence). Surface ozone is sensitive to temperature and water vapour changes, but future levels depend on precursor emissions. Although there is low confidence in precise regional changes (Section 6.5), climate change will generally introduce a surface ozone (O3) penalty (increasing concentrations with increasing warming levels) over regions with high anthropogenic and/or natural ozone precursor emissions, while in less polluted regions higher temperatures and humidity favour destruction of ozone (Schnell et al., 2016). There is low confidence in changes to future stagnation events given the lack of robust projections of related atmospheric conditions, such as future atmospheric blocking events (Sections 3.3.3 and 8.4.2). The response of regional air pollution to climate change will also be affected by other CIDs like fire weather, as well as by ecosystem responses such as shifts in emissions by vegetation (Fiore et al., 2015). Section 6.5 assessed medium confidence that climate-driven changes to meteorological conditions generally favour extreme air pollution episodes in heavily polluted environments, but noted strong regional and metric dependencies. Given the dominant influence of future air quality policies, uncertainties around stagnation or blocking events, and the potential contrasting regional changes of conditions favouring ozone and PM formation, accumulation and destruction, cells in Tables 12.3–12.11 for air pollution weather are marked as low confidence, and the reader is referred to Section 6.5 for further details."

wg1_ch12_12.4_p12,NO_TITLE,"Radiation at surface: Radiation has undergone decadal variations in past observations, which are mostly responding to the so-called dimming and brightening phenomenon driven by the increase and decrease of aerosols. Over the last two decades or so, brightening continues in Europe and North America and dimming stabilizes over South and East Asia and increases in some other areas (Section 7.2.2.3). Future regional shortwave radiation projections depend mostly on cloud trends, aerosol and water vapour trends, and stratospheric ozone when considering UV radiation. Over Africa in 2050 and beyond, there is medium confidence that radiation will increase in North and South Africa and decrease over the Sahara, North Eastern Africa and Western Africa (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; Soares et al., 2019; C. Tang et al., 2019; Sawadogo et al., 2020, 2021). Over Asia, the CMIP5 multi-model mean response shows that solar radiation will decrease in South Asia and increase in East Asia (medium confidence) by the mid-century RCP8.5 (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; Ruosteenoja et al., 2019b). Projected solar resources show an increasing trend throughout the 21st century in East Asia under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios in CMIP5 simulations (medium confidence) (Wild et al., 2015; F. Zhang et al., 2018; Shiogama et al., 2020). More sunshine is projected over Australia in winter and spring by the end of the century (medium confidence) with the increases in Southern Australia exceeding 10% (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Wild et al., 2015). In Central and South America, there is medium confidence of increasing solar radiation over the Amazon basin and the northern part of South America (medium confidence) (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; de Jong et al., 2019). There is low confidence for an increase in surface radiation in central Europe, owing in particular to disagreement in cloud cover across global and regional models (Jerez et al., 2015; Bartók et al., 2017; Craig et al., 2018), as well as water vapour. The treatment of aerosol appears to be key in explaining these differences (Boé, 2016; Undorf et al., 2018; Boé et al., 2020; Gutiérrez et al., 2020). Regional and global studies, however, indicate that there is medium confidence in increasing radiation over southern Europe and decreasing radiation over Northern Europe. Increasing radiation trends are also found over southern and eastern USA, and decreasing trends over North-Western North America (Wild et al., 2015; Losada Carreño et al., 2020), despite large differences between responses from regional climate models (RCMs) and general circulation models (GCMs) over southern and eastern USA (low confidence), where, as for Central Europe, the role of aerosols appears important (Chen, 2021). Over polar regions there is medium confidence of a decrease in radiation due to increasing moisture in the atmosphere and clouds (Wild et al., 2015)."

In Southern Africa, the number of ‘flash’ droughts (with rapid onset and durations from a few days to couple of months) have increased by 220% between 1961 and 2016 as a result of anthropogenic warming (Yuan et al., 2018). Section 11.9 notes medium confidence increases in agricultural and ecological drought trends in North, Western and Central Africa as well as both Southern Africa regions. The most striking drought is the Western Cape drought in 2015–2018, a prolonged drought that resulted in acute water shortages (Wolski, 2018; Burls et al., 2019; Section 10.6.2). Anthropogenic climate change caused a threefold increase in the probability of such a drought to occur (Chapters 10 and 11; Botai et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018). Section 11.9 assesses increases in agricultural and ecological drought at 2°C GWL for North Africa and West Southern Africa (high confidence) and for East Southern Africa and Madagascar (medium confidence), with confidence generally rising for higher emissions scenarios (Sylla et al., 2016b; Zhao and Dai, 2017; Diedhiou et al., 2018; Abiodun et al., 2019; Todzo et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021b).

In Southern Africa, the number of ‘flash’ droughts (with rapid onset and durations from a few days to couple of months) have increased by 220% between 1961 and 2016 as a result of anthropogenic warming (Yuan et al., 2018).

Anthropogenic climate change caused a threefold increase in the probability of such a drought to occur (Chapters 10 and 11; Botai et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018).

These studies indicate an increase in the frequency and magnitude of FFDI extreme quantiles, as well as a shift of the fire season start towards spring, lengthening the fire season. The unprecedented large fires of austral spring and summer of 2019 in south-east Australia were a result of extreme hot and dry weather in significantly drier than average conditions that had persisted since 2017, in combination with consistently stronger than average winds, resulting in above average to highest on record FFDI values in much of the country (Abram et al., 2021). These fires have been attributed to climate change through the temperature component of fire weather indices (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021). In New Zealand, days with very high and extreme fire weather increased in 12 out of 28 monitored sites, and decreased in 8, in the period 1997–2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020).

This mean ocean surface warming is connected to longer and more frequent marine heatwaves in the region (Oliver et al., 2018). Over the period 1982–2016, the coastal ocean of Australia experienced on average more than 1.5 marine heatwaves (MHWs) per year, with the north coast of Western Australia and the Tasman Sea experiencing on average 2.5–3 MHWs per year. The average duration was between 10 and 15 days, with somewhat longer and hotter MHWs in the Tasman Sea. In New Zealand, the south-east coast of South Island experiences the most MHWs (2.5–3 per year). The duration of MHW in New Zealand is on average 10–15 days (Oliver et al., 2018).

Similarly Norway and Austria will also see a rising of the natural snow elevation with consequences for the ski season (Scott et al., 2020; Steiger and Scott, 2020). In the Alps, recent simulations project a reduction in snow water equivalent (SWE) at 1500 m above sea level of 80–90% by 2100 under the A1B scenario and a snow season that would start 2-4 weeks later and end 5-10 weeks earlier than the 1992–2012 average (Schmucki et al., 2015), which is equivalent to a shift in elevation of about 700 m (Marty et al., 2017b).

In the Pyrenees a slow snow cover decline has been observed starting from the industrial period with a sharp increase since 1955 (López-Moreno et al., 2020). Under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios the reliability elevation for snowmaking will rise by 200–300 m in the Alps and 400–600 m in the Pyrenees by mid-century. End of century projections of natural snow conditions are highly dependent on the scenario, being stationary for the RCP2.6 and continuously decreasing under RCP8.5 to not have any more natural snow conditions at any of the locations in the French Alps and Pyrenees (Spandre et al., 2019). Similarly Norway and Austria will also see a rising of the natural snow elevation with consequences for the ski season (Scott et al., 2020; Steiger and Scott, 2020). In the Alps, recent simulations project a reduction in snow water equivalent (SWE) at 1500 m above sea level of 80–90% by 2100 under the A1B scenario and a snow season that would start 2-4 weeks later and end 5-10 weeks earlier than the 1992–2012 average (Schmucki et al., 2015), which is equivalent to a shift in elevation of about 700 m (Marty et al., 2017b). For elevations above 3000 m above sea level, a decline in SWE of at least 10% is expected by the end of the century even when assuming the largest projected precipitation increase. Similar trends are observed for the Pyrenees and Scandinavia (López-Moreno et al., 2009; Räisänen and Eklund, 2012). For the northern French Alps above 1500 m and the Ötztal locations in the Austrian alps SWE has a similar decreasing trend altitudinally dependent for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 until mid-century and with significant differentiation among them in the second half of the century up to snow-free conditions under RCP8.5 (Hanzer et al., 2018; Verfaillie et al., 2018)."

Central Europe is one of the regions where glaciers are projected to lose substantial mass even under low-emissions scenarios (Section 9.5.1.3; MedECC, 2020).

Projections for NEN and WNA are lower at 20–30 m under the same RCPs. The highest median mid-century projection in the region is for CNA at around 125 m under both RCPs. RCP4.5 projections for 2100 show shoreline retreats of 100 m or more along the sandy coasts of NWN, CNA, and NCA, while retreats of between 40 and 80 m are projected in other regions. Under RCP8.5, retreats exceeding 100 m are projected in all regions except NEN and WNA (approximately 80 m) by 2100, with particularly high retreats in NWN (160 m) and CNA (330 m). The total length of sandy coasts in North America that are projected to retreat by more than a median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 15,000 km and 25,000 km respectively, an increase of approximately 70%."

Caribbean and Pacific small islands have mostly tropical climates and local conditions are also influenced by diverse topography ranging from low-lying islands and atolls to volcanic and mountainous terrain. Climate variability in these islands is influenced by the trade winds, easterly waves, tropical cyclones (TC), and the migrations of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), and other modes of climate variability as discussed in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2.

As the ocean has taken up about 90% of the global warming for the period 1971–2018 (Section 7.2.2.2), the emergence of the sea surface temperature increase signal has already been observed in global oceans over the last century (Hawkins et al., 2020). The signal in sea ice extent decrease has already emerged in the Arctic Ocean (Landrum and Holland, 2020), while ocean acidification and low oxygen have also already emerged in many oceanic regions and will emerge in all global oceans by 2050 under RCP8.5 (Section 12.5.2 and Table 12.10). This section assesses key climatic impact-drivers that can be linked with sectoral and regional vulnerability and exposure in open and deep oceans, drawing from previous Chapters (Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9)."

High climate velocities are particularly noteworthy for biodiversity hotspots given complex ecosystem dynamics and niche climates not easily replicated under shifted geographies (Burrows et al., 2014; Halpern et al., 2015; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016).

On the western slope of the subtropical Andes (30°S–38°S) in central Chile, the mean value of the free tropospheric height of the 0°C isotherm under wet conditions is projected to be close to or higher than the upper quartile of the distribution in the current climate, towards the end of the century and under RCP8.5 (Mardones and Garreaud, 2020). In the Alps and the Pyrenees, Spandre et al. (2019) projected a rise in the natural snow elevation of between 200–300 m and 400–600 m by mid-century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. In the same region, the environmental equilibrium-line altitude is projected to exceed the maximum elevation of 69%, 81% and 92% of the glaciers by the end of the century under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5, respectively (Žebre et al., 2021)."

There is generally low confidence in future projections of general fire weather risk evolution in tropical forests and evolutions depend on the region (Abatzoglou et al., 2019).

Tropical regions, but also mid-latitude regions to a lesser extent, will experience an increasing number of days with heat indices crossing dangerous thresholds used to characterize heat stress, such as HI > 41°C (Figure 12.4). The increase, by the end of century, exceeds 100 days per year in most tropical areas under SSP5-8.5 but remains much more limited (almost half) under SSP1-2.6. Several global-scale studies have shown that high temperature extremes will increase everywhere (high confidence) (Gourdji et al., 2013; Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017; Harrington et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2018; Lehner et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018; Tebaldi and Wehner, 2018; Arnell et al., 2019; Russo et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021), although the change depends on the indicator (see also Chapter 11). For example, by 2080, at least 80% of the land surface is expected to experience average summer temperatures greater than the historical (1920–2014) maximum with high (RCP8.5) emissions (Lehner et al., 2018). The areas of rice and maize cropland with damaging extreme temperatures during the reproductive season will increase by a factor of three under RCP8.5 (Gourdji et al., 2013). Under a high emissions scenario, heatwaves that are currently considered rare are projected to become the norm almost everywhere by the end of the century (Russo et al., 2014). Heat stress as a combined function of temperature and humidity also increases at the global scale, especially with high emissions (e.g., Matthews et al., 2017). Growing degree-days and cooling degree-days also increase everywhere (Arnell et al., 2019) with the absolute and proportional changes depending on temperature threshold. Increases in temperatures will result in reductions in heating degree days (Arnell et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b) and a widespread reduced frequency of cold extremes (high confidence)."
wg1_ch12_12.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Integrating the results of the regional assessments in Section 12.4 shows that changes in CIDs linked with the water cycle or atmospheric dynamics (e.g., storms) vary more among regions, largely due to the spatial pattern of changes in atmospheric circulation and changes in precipitation and evaporation (Chapters 8 and 11). There is  high confidence that heavy precipitation and pluvial floods will be increasing in a majority of land regions, primarily due to the well-understood Clausius–Clapeyron relationship describing the increase in moisture content with air temperature (Chapters 8 and 11), but there is a large spatial variability in fluvial flood hazards. Top-down global-scale studies show that although fluvial flood hazards are projected to decrease in regions where there are large reductions in seasonal rainfall totals or where warmer temperatures mean less accumulated snow, at the global scale, fluvial flood hazard (characterized as the area affected, size of peak or likelihood of an event) is projected to increase substantially through the century (Giuntoli et al., 2015; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Winsemius et al., 2016; Alfieri et al., 2017; Dottori et al., 2018; Arnell et al., 2019). Projected changes in agricultural and hydrological drought characteristics are dependent on the indicator used to define drought (Sections 11.6 and Section 12.3.2), but there is at least medium confidence of an increase in the drought hazard in many parts of the world. This is also reflected in global-scale studies, with Naumann et al. (2018), for example, showing that the global mean average drought duration (based on the SPEI index which is calculated from the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation) increased from 7 months with the current climate to 18.5 months for a global warming level of 3°C. The apparent global increase in drought occurrence is greater when evaporation is captured in the drought indicator (e.g., SPEI) than when the indicator is based on precipitation alone (as in SPI; Carrão et al., 2018). There is evidence that the likelihood of simultaneous events in several locations will increase: Trnka et al. (2019) found that the proportion of wheat-growing areas experiencing simultaneous severe water stress events (based on SPEI) in a year increased from 15% under current conditions to up to 60% at the end of the 21st century under high emissions."

There is less confidence in the projected distribution of change in fire weather across regions in global-scale studies.

wg1_ch12_12.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The emergence of a climate change signal occurs when that signal exceeds some critical threshold (usually taken to be a measure of natural variability; see for example, Hawkins and Sutton, 2012) or when the probability distribution of an indicator becomes significantly different to that over a reference period (e.g., Chadwick et al., 2019; see also Chapter 10 and Section 1.4.2), in which case external anthropogenic forcings can be detected as causal factors. The ‘time of emergence’ (ToE) or ‘temperature of emergence’ is the time or global warming level thresholds associated with this exceedance. Emergence is particularly relevant to impacts, risk assessment and adaptation because human and natural systems are largely adapted to natural variability but may be vulnerable if exposed to changes that go beyond this variability range; this is not to say that changes within natural variability have no impact, as occurrence of damaging extremes proves. Emergence also informs the timing of adaptation measures. The emergence of a change is always relative to a reference period (e.g., the pre-industrial period or a recent past), depending on the framing question. In the former case, the goal is to estimate the amplitude of an anthropogenically driven change while in the latter, it is to estimate the amplitude of change relative to a baseline that is familiar to stakeholders. Both questions are important for risk assessment, but the former may be more directly interpretable in a mitigation context. The variability also refers to a time scale, generally interannual to inter-decadal. See (Section 1.4.2 and Chapter 10 for more details about how emergence is defined and used in the literature."

In many cases, however, sufficient literature for a robust region-by-region assessment of ToE is lacking. The assessment herein is made by CID.

In addition, a homogeneous interpretation of multiple studies is hampered by heterogeneous methodologies used to calculate emergence. In this section, we assess emergence and its confidence level based on such multiple methods as provided by the literature, and unless specified otherwise, emergence here refers to a signal to noise ration S/N > 1 relative to a pre-industrial baseline and interannual variability (the ‘noise’).

In the current climate, the highest S/N ratios exceed five over Central Africa, Amazonia, East and South East Asia. Seasonal warming emergence depends on the season. Because the temperature variability in the mid-latitudes is higher in winter than in summer, the emergence of seasonal warming occurs for summer but not for winter in most of this part of the world. In Europe, summer warming has emerged in all regions (medium confidence, medium agreement), and in North America, it has emerged only over Eastern and Western regions while in winter there is low confidence of an emergence in warming in all regions for both Europe and North America (Lehner et al., 2017; Hawkins et al., 2020). When considering the climate of the end of the 20th century (i.e., recent past) as a baseline, the emergence of mean temperature is projected at very different times depending on the scenario.

For snow depth or snow water equivalent, there is low confidence (limited evidence) of the emergence of a decrease before 2050 because climate change also increases the variability of the snow depth signal, for example in Europe (Section 3.4.2; Willibald et al., 2020). Terrestrial permafrost is warming worldwide due to climate change (Sections 2.3.2.5 and 9.5.2). Due to weak interannual variability of permafrost temperatures, terrestrial permafrost warming has emerged above natural variability in almost all observed time series of the Northern Hemisphere (medium confidence, limited evidence,  high agreement) (Biskaborn et al., 2019), but the active layer thickness exhibits considerable interannual variability inhibiting evidence for emergence (Chapter 9)."

WGI is assessing changes in climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), which are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events and extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions (Sections 12.1–12.3). In the assessment of Representative Key Risk (RKR) categories and Reasons for Concern (RFCs) in WGII Chapter 16, the focus lies on the adverse consequences of climate change, for which many types of CIDs (i.e., ‘hazards’ in the context of identified risks) play a key role. This box synthesizes the assessment of such hazards according to global warming levels (GWLs) from various chapters of WGI to inform understanding of their potential changes and associated risks with temperature levels in general, and in particular to facilitate WGII integrated assessments of RKRs and RFCs. Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, connects the organization of regional information according to GWLs to the other common dimension along which future projections are organized: that is, scenarios. Section 1.6 describes all dimensions of integration adopted in this Report, adding cumulative carbon emissions to GWLs and scenarios."

Increasing GWLs translate into changing characteristics of frequency, duration, intensity, seasonality and spatial extent for many of these hazards that are also apparent in scenario-based results (Chapters 11 and 12, and Sections 12.4 and 12.5.1). Other relevant hazards coincide with long-term trends embodying a gradual change that may result in unfavourable environmental conditions. Also, increasing GWLs increase the likelihood of compound temporal or spatial occurrence of similar or different hazards (Section 11.8).

As an evolving field, there are multiple definitions of climate services (Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016). The Global Framework for Climate Services defines a climate service as the provision of climate information to assist decision-making. The service includes appropriate engagement from users and providers, is based on scientifically credible information and expertise, has an effective access mechanism, and responds to user needs (Hewitt et al., 2012)."
wg1_ch12_12.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 WGII introduced climate services as bridging the generation and application of climate knowledge, also describing their history and concepts (Jones et al., 2014). Since then, this transdisciplinary field has been growing rapidly (Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016; Hewitt et al., 2020a), with the social sciences in particular pointing out knowledge requirements for co-design and co-development of climate services (Larosa and Mysiak, 2019; Daniels et al., 2020; Steynor et al., 2020). Climate services differ from more research-driven vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation research in their orientation towards decision support (Stone and Meinke, 2005; Ruane et al., 2016; Golding et al., 2019), but overlaps exist (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019). Climate services are often targeted at building resilience to climate-related hazards from near real-time to seasonal and multi-decadal time horizons, to inform adaptation to climate variability and change (Hewitt et al., 2012), widely recognized as an important challenge for sustainable development and risk management (Moss et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2014; Vaughan et al., 2018). This section focuses largely on climate change time scales (past, present and future), which are the focus of AR6 WGI."

Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 provides concrete examples of climate services. The section builds on the introduction to climate services in Section 1.2.3.3 and the assessment of regional climate information construction – including storylines – discussed in Sections 10.3.4.2, 10.5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 10.3. The (Atlas supports the provision of climate information across WGs by providing interactive maps and further details to the material made publicly accessible for use in climate services. WGII (Chapter 17) further elaborates on climate services as enablers for climate risk management."
wg1_ch12_12.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The idea of climate services is not new and has its roots in meteorology and climatology (Larosa and Mysiak, 2019). It can be traced back to the late 1970s and the US National Climate Program Act of 1978 (Henderson, 2016). The development of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) after the World Climate Conference-3 in Geneva brought international attention and renewed impetus to the climate services field (Hewitt et al., 2012). As a result, large investments have been made globally and regionally in the development of user-driven climate services. WMO has created Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) to facilitate climate service development by regional and national providers (Hewitt et al., 2020a). The European Union declared its ambition to stimulate ‘the creation of a community of climate services application developers and users that matches supply and demand for climate information and prediction’, giving primacy to climate services that are user-driven and science-informed (Lourenço et al., 2016), thus embracing concepts of co-design, co-development and co-evaluation of climate services (Street, 2016). Diverse and action-driven international initiatives allowed climate services to progressively shift from mitigation towards adaptation (Larosa and Mysiak, 2019). Opportunities for the development of climate services have emerged through the 2015 Agendas (Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals and Sendai Framework), Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, Multilateral Development Banks and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (see Section 1.2.2)."
wg1_ch12_12.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Scientific advancements in climate services related to meteorology and climatology are still closely linked to essential climate variables (Larosa and Mysiak, 2019) and benefit from consistently growing computational power, infrastructure and storage capacity to meet the demands of higher spatially and temporally resolved climate information (Buontempo et al., 2020). Climate services also focus on impact chains, providing decision makers with information on climate change with cross-sectoral impact assessments for adaptation (Jacob and Solman, 2017). Today there is a diversity of climate services that involve interpretation, analysis, and communication of different sources of climate data, ideally combining different types of knowledge (scientific/technical, experiential, indigenous, etc.), to a targeted group of decision makers (Parris et al., 2016; Olazabal et al., 2018; Pezij et al., 2019). Jacobs and Street (2020) argue that climate services should be expanded to also address societal challenges, such as system transformation, that include climate in the context of other risks and development challenges."
wg1_ch12_12.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Climate services are undertaken in public and private sectors at global, regional, national, and local scales (Hewitt et al., 2012, 2020b; Cortekar et al., 2020). Intermediaries such as private sector consulting companies, national climate service providers, research organizations, government agencies or academic institutions provide climate services that translate aspects of climate research to the specific context of decision makers (see also Section 10.5). The EU Roadmap for Climate Services (EC, 2015; Street, 2016) focuses on developing a market for climate services comprising of both public and private domains. The GFCS, under the leadership of several United Nations Agencies, emphasizes the public domain by supporting national and regional capacity building and development of climate services mainly through National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (Hewitt et al., 2012; Domingos et al., 2016; Sivakumar and Lucio, 2018; WMO, 2018). There are ongoing debates about the commercialization of climate services (M.S. Brooks, 2013; WMO, 2015; Webber and Donner, 2017; Hoa, 2018; Troccoli et al., 2018; Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019; Hewitt et al., 2020a). Some argue that the commercialization of climate services is needed to meet the diverse needs of specific clients and to drive innovation in the field (M.S. Brooks, 2013; Troccoli, 2018a). Others argue that if climate services shift incentives for climate science away from the public interest towards profit-seeking, this will result in less publicly accessible and transparent climate information and more private knowledge (Keele, 2019; Tart et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch12_12.6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Some climate adaptation planning already uses climate information as provided by the IPCC. However, depending on the decision context, this information may be too coarse, too broad or too disciplinary to directly inform decision-making at the scale where adaptation measures are taken (Howarth and Painter, 2016; Nissan et al., 2019). Thus, while the IPCC’s role is clearly perceived as that of a reference – an authoritative starting point – there is a need for complementary information to translate the assessments at the national, local or sectoral level (Howarth and Painter, 2016; Kjellström et al., 2016; van den Hurk et al., 2018; Vaughan et al., 2018). The AR6 Interactive Atlas (see Atlas.2) does provide a collection of observational data and global and regional climate projections. It is designed as a climate service towards the needs of WGI and beyond, to assess the state of the climate by offering data, maps and a level of expert analysis by aggregation of results to regions, scenarios and warming levels."
wg1_ch12_12.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The climate services landscape is fast growing and very broad, as reflected in the vast diversity of practices and products that can be found in the peer-reviewed literature (very high confidence). However, a large part of climate services practices and products is published in ‘grey’ literature (i.e., non-peer reviewed or non-academic) by private consultancy and non-scientific civil organizations, many of which are not in the public domain. In addition, the respective climate service context of a specific stakeholder in a sector dictates what climate information is required and on what scales and in what format it is most usefully provided. The extent and type of engagement between scientists and users is another critical aspect of climate services (see Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 1, and Section 10.5). The assessment here can thus only provide a partial and rather general representation of available practices and products in the evolving climate services field."

In many cases this requires recognizing that stakeholders make decisions through a combination of scientific information and additional values (Vanderlinden et al., 2017; Parker and Lusk, 2019; see also Sections 1.2.3 and 10.5.4). The emerging climate service literature may clarify some features of climate information requested by users, for instance climatic impact-driver identification and prioritization through stakeholder engagement; the specification of thresholds for various regions/sectors; the types of metrics (magnitude/intensity, frequency, duration, timing, spatial extent) that are of primary interest; and decision support systems where informatics allow stakeholders to custom-make impact-relevant thresholds and then query databases to understand current and future characteristics (Bachmair et al., 2016; Buontempo et al., 2020).

wg1_ch12_12.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate services require user engagement and can take various forms in which climate information and data are delivered or communicated to the users (very high confidence). Different levels of user engagement exist, which can range from passive engagement to interactive group activities, to focused relationships between climate service provider and users. These result in different types of climate service products including websites, capacity building, and co-design of tailored climate indices (Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 1; Hewitt et al., 2017a). The fundamental basis for climate service development is the co-production process between climate service provider and user (Valiela, 2006; Briley et al., 2015; Golding et al., 2017a; K. Vincent et al., 2018a; Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019; Schipper et al., 2019), which can be very resource intensive (Buontempo et al., 2018; Falloon et al., 2018; Kolstad et al., 2019) and varies strongly from case to case (Reinecke, 2015; Bremer et al., 2019; Goodess et al., 2019; Jung and Schindler, 2019). Climate services scholars and practitioners can better facilitate and embrace the knowledge co-production process if it is recognized as a multi-faceted phenomenon with several dimensions (e.g., constitutive, interactional, institutional, pedagogical, empowerment) (Kruk et al., 2017; Knaggård et al., 2019; Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019)."

Climate services include a range of knowledge brokerage activities such as: identifying knowledge needs; dissemination of knowledge; coordinating and networking; compiling and translating; building capacity through informed decision-making; analysing, evaluating and developing policy; and personal consultation (e.g., De Bruin et al., 2020). When analysing four European climate services, Reinecke (2015) found that different climate services emphasized different knowledge brokerage activities."

Many countries (including almost every country in Europe – see Atlas.8.2) have established a climate service centre, which follow different practices of user engagement and provide different products (e.g., Kjellström et al., 2016; Skelton et al., 2017; Kolstad et al., 2019). Climate services in other countries may be distributed across agencies and programmes, although these are often not centrally coordinated (Parris et al., 2016). One of the key pillars of the GFCS is the Climate Services Information System (CSIS), which is the principal mechanism through which information about past, present and future climate is archived, analysed, modelled, exchanged and processed for users (Hewitt et al., 2020a). Some national governments also have organized national climate projections to be used for official planning (e.g., EEA, 2018).

Quality control and quality assurance are still weak elements in the development of climate service products (Jacob, 2020). Quality criteria or standards (that go beyond good practice) will have to be developed and agreed (Baldissera Pacchetti et al., 2021). These challenges reflect the dilemma that exists at the interface between the climate modelling community and climate services regarding: (i) the purposes of the models for climate research versus service development; (ii) the gap between the spatial and temporal scales of the models versus the scales needed in applications; and (iii) tailoring climate model results to real-world applications (Benestad et al., 2017; Hackenbruch et al., 2017; van den Hurk et al., 2018)."

One form of value may be determined by a particular user community’s willingness to pay (Acquah and Onumah, 2011; Ouédraogo et al., 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2021), which however cannot reflect the value of climate services as a public good and for society as a whole (Hewitt et al., 2012). Literature is only recently emerging on the socio-economic benefits of weather and climate services (Vaughan et al., 2019). Early studies and guidelines from the WMO focus on cost–benefit ratios (Perrels et al., 2013; WMO, 2015). Issues related to demand-driven versus supply-driven climate services (Lourenço et al., 2016; Street, 2016; Daniels et al., 2020), public versus private climate services (Hewitt et al., 2020a) and business models for climate services (Hoa, 2018) have been raised. A large share of climate services documented in peer-reviewed literature is currently provided in non-market frameworks (e.g., public service obligations and research and development grants) (Hoa, 2018; Kolstad et al., 2019; Cortekar et al., 2020)."
wg1_ch12_12.6.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Other challenges related to governance and dealing with complex systems are sometimes acknowledged but less well described in the climate services domain (Hewitt et al., 2020a). Importantly, decision contexts are strongly rooted in past practice (which often does not even make optimal use of past climate information), stakeholder experience, and history. Even important emerging concepts of co-production, entry points, and champions do not always fall naturally into these realities without significant effort. The social sciences have an important role in helping understand and tackle these challenges (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019)."

wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate services involve the provision of climate information in such a way as to assist decision-making. The service needs to have appropriate engagement from users and providers; be based on scientifically credible information and expertise; have an effective access mechanism; and meet the users’ needs (Hewitt et al., 2012). Predominantly, climate services are targeted at informing and enabling risk management in adaptation to climate variability and change (Jones et al., 2014; Vaughan et al., 2018). Chapter 1 introduces climate services in a broader context of interaction between science and society, including how climate information can be tailored and co-produced for greatest utility in specific contexts. Chapter 10 assesses the key foundations for the generation of climate information about regional climate change. Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas comprehensively assess regional climate change information. The Interactive Atlas gives access to various repositories of quantitative climate information. In WGII, Chapter 17 assesses climate services in the context of climate risk management."

wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate service contexts are diverse and complex. They can be characterized using different factors such as sectors, regions, purposes, time horizons, data sources, level of processing of climate data, background knowledge, type of climate service providers, as well as the nature of the interactions between providers, users and other stakeholders (Bessembinder et al., 2019). To illustrate the wide diversity of climate change information in climate services, a useful categorization is by user –provider engagement of climate services (Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 1). One broad category includes ‘websites and web tools’ which generally focuses on data and information provision (Hewitson et al., 2017). Websites are generally able to reach many users, but engagement is passive through one-way transfer of information. The second broad category involves ‘interactive group activities’, such as workshops, meetings and interactive forums, which create a stronger dialogue between climate service providers and decision makers. Multi-way communication and regular interaction enable building of trust, co-learning and co-production of products and services. The third broad category involves ‘focused relationships’ which are tailored, targeted and address very specific needs of the user. Effective engagement arises from an iterative process between the provider and user to ensure the user’s needs are being addressed appropriately (Hewitt et al., 2017a)."

wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides free and open access to climate data, tools and information through a website. It also includes demonstration projects that show how C3S data can be used in practice through case studies, training sessions and workshops (Thepaut et al., 2018). A large audience of the service is composed of intermediate users, loosely defined as the community of operators in one of the intermediate steps between the primary producers of climate data and the ultimate beneficiaries."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"To address this audience, the strategy of C3S is to provide free and open access climate data and tools such as historical observations (both satellite and ground-based), climate data records relevant for a number of Essential Climate Variables (Bojinski et al., 2014), global and regional reanalyses, climate monitoring bulletins, seasonal predictions, as well as both global (a selection of simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP; Taylor et al., 2012; Eyring et al., 2016) and regional climate projections from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Euro- and Med-CORDEX; Jacob et al., 2014; Ruti et al., 2016). A number of indices for various sectors can be calculated through cloud-based tools. For instance, in order to address the specific needs of key sectoral users, climate impact indicators for common variables such as ‘heating degree days’ can be calculated by the users and made available to others (Buontempo et al., 2020). All this material is quality controlled following a standardized, transparent and traceable framework."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"C3S also facilitates the tailoring process, by providing a series of working open-source, cloud-based demonstrators which show how climate data can be transformed into actionable information to meet specific user requirements. This tailoring process covers the chain between the definition of key indicators all the way to the user interface. The definition and production of C3S products involve scientists that produced and assessed the data. A variety of potential users are involved in the definition of indicators and other products."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Through its quality assurance process and demonstrators, C3S provides a basic evaluation of all climate data; it provides access, and it encourages the users to develop their own case-specific analysis within the C3S infrastructure. Trustworthiness and relevance of such an analysis are substantially strengthened through a distillation process, co-designed by the user and data provider, and drawing upon multiple lines of evidence and process-based evaluation of model fitness (Section 10.5)."

wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"Science-application engagement is extremely challenging, especially in critically important but complex contexts such as rapidly growing cities in developing nations (Culwick and Patel, 2017). The publicly funded Future Resilience for African CiTies And Lands (FRACTAL) project was conceived and designed in response to extensive and strong evidence and experience that useful and useable climate services require strong mutual relationships across the science-application interface that can be built using supportive processes and structures (A. Taylor et al., 2017)."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"Informed by this understanding, FRACTAL was grounded in a very reflexive and context-guided approach with city decision-making at its core (A. Taylor et al., 2017). Representatives from selected southern African cities were included in the proposal design and, throughout the project, a core principle was to allow the city partners to lead and guide the process."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p16,NO_TITLE,"Two important elements were deployed in FRACTAL: ‘embedded researchers’ and ‘learning labs’. Embedded researchers were seconded into the municipality and served as the essential connection for the learning process within each city (Steynor et al., 2020). Learning labs (Arrighi et al., 2016) were interactive structures in which participants from academia, local city government and councils, state-owned enterprises, communities and community development institutions, and others could interact. Embedded researchers and learning labs were the backbone of ongoing learning processes within each city and resulted in more focused small-group dialogues, capacity development and training processes, and within-city research and engagement activities. Each learning lab focused initially on identifying ‘burning issues’ without a requirement that they involve strong climate linkages. However, with the overarching focus on resilience, discussions evolved in that direction and the burning issues identified often centred around water in peri-urban areas, for example in Windhoek, Namibia (Scott et al., 2018)."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p17,NO_TITLE,"The learning labs also introduced and developed the concept of Climate Risk Narratives (CRNs) as a process and product to generate and integrate climate and socio-economic information relevant to adaptation and resilience (see Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 2, and Box 10.2 on storylines) (Jack et al., 2020). The first CRNs were informed primarily by climate evidence, but also included some tentative socio-economic impact elements gleaned from literature and other studies. Their content was intentionally provocative and designed to promote debate and discussion, and subsequent iteration. Many participants noted that this was the first time that various important conversations across governance structures and disciplinary areas had occurred around what climate change may actually mean. This demonstrates the engagement value of CRNs as a key element in an iterative co-production process to ensure important details are included correctly, such as the local context, terms and names as well as providing reality checks on the impacts and societal responses (Jack et al., 2020)."

wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p23,NO_TITLE,"This broad category involves one-to-one engagement between a provider and a user with very specific needs. One such user is the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which has committed to making all its investments climate resilient by implementing a climate risk management framework (ADB, 2014, 2018; Lu, 2019). The climate risk management framework mandates all climate-sensitive investment projects undertake a climate risk and adaptation assessment, to identify material risks of a changing climate to the proposed project and potential adaptive measures to be incorporated into project design, implementation, maintenance and/or monitoring. Typically, loan project processing teams procure consulting services for a bespoke climate risk and adaptation assessment (CRA) for a specific project. The user –provider engagement is highly targeted and goal-oriented. An example of such a focused user –provider engagement is the CRA carried out as part of an investment project in Vietnam, the Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces (WEIDAP) project."
wg1_ch12_cross-chapter-box-12.2_p24,NO_TITLE,"In the wake of the El Niño-induced 2015–2016 severe drought, which caused major damage to agricultural land in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, the WEIDAP project was initiated to improve water productivity of irrigated agriculture. Proposed project interventions include a package of both ‘soft’ (e.g., policy, institutional and capacity building, on-farm water efficiency practices) and ‘hard’ (modernized irrigation schemes) activities. To ensure that the project delivers expected benefits under a changing climate, consultants were recruited to carry out a detailed CRA, working as part of the overall project processing team. Through extensive consultations with the rest of the project team and review of literature including relevant climate projections, the CRA consultants chose to construct three broad climate scenarios for the 2050s (a time frame appropriate for the lifetime of the irrigation schemes being proposed under the project): a warm-and-wet, a hot-and-wet, and a hotter future. Outputs from a selection of CMIP5 models were analysed under these three scenarios, to derive changes in temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, which in turn were used as inputs to hydrological, crop and agro-economics models to assess the impacts of climate change on the overall project performance. Table 1 presents the summary of the key parameters under the three scenarios. Recommendations from the CRA included (largely minor) refinements and additional activities for drought planning, detailed engineering design of the relevant project components (such as access roads, river crossings and foundations), and support for poorer farmers who may not be able to afford access to water and climate-resilient technologies."

Climatic impact-drivers may represent a long-term average condition (such as the average winter temperatures that affect indoor heating requirements), a common event (such as a frost that kills off warm-season plants), or an extreme event (such as a coastal flood that destroys homes). A single climatic impact-driver may lead to detrimental effects for one part of society while benefiting another, while others are not affected at all. A climatic impact-driver (or its change caused by climate change) is therefore not universally hazardous or beneficial, but we refer to it as a ‘hazard’ when experts determine it is detrimental to a specific system."

(b)  Shoreline position change along sandy coasts by the year 2100 relative to 2010 for RCP8.5 (metres; negative values indicate shoreline retreat) from the CMIP5-based dataset presented by Vousdoukas et al. (2020b).  (c) Bar plots for Q100 (m3s–1km–2) averaged over land areas for the AR6 WGI Reference Regions (defined in Chapter 1). The left-hand column within each panel (associated with the left-hand y-axis) shows the ‘recent past’ (1995–2014) Q100 absolute values in grey shades. The other columns (associated with the right-hand y-axis) show the Q100 changes relative to the recent past values for two time periods (‘mid’ 2041–2060 and ‘long’ 2081–2100) and for three global warming levels (defined relative to the pre-industrial period 1850–1900): 1.5°C (purple), 2°C (yellow) and 4°C (brown). The bars show the median (dots) and the 10–90th percentile range of model ensemble values across each model ensemble. CMIP6 is shown by the darkest colours, CMIP5 by medium, and CORDEX by light. SSP5-8.5/RCP8.5 is shown in red and SSP1-2.6/RCP2.6 in blue.  (d) Bar plots for shoreline position change show CMIP5-based projections of shoreline position change along sandy coasts for 2050 and 2100 relative to 2010 for RCP8.5 (red) and RCP4.5 (blue) from Vousdoukas et al. (2020b). Dots indicate regional mean change estimates and bars show the 5–95th percentile range of associated uncertainty. Note that these shoreline position change projections assume that there are no additional sediment sinks/sources or any physical barriers to shoreline retreat. See Technical (Annex VI for details of indices. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 12.SM.1)."
