wg3_ch05_executive-summary_p1,NO_TITLE,"Assessment of the social science literature and regional case studies reveals how social norms, culture, and individual choices interact with infrastructure and other structural changes over time. This provides new insight into climate change mitigation strategies, and how economic and social activity might be organised across sectors to support emission reductions. To enhance well-being, people demand services and not primary energy and physical resources per se. Focusing on demand for services and the different social and political roles people play broadens the participation in climate action."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Sixth Assessment Report  of the IPCC (AR6), for the first time, features a chapter on demand, services, and social aspects of mitigation. It builds on the AR4 and AR5, which linked behaviour and lifestyle change to mitigating climate change (IPCC 2007; Roy and Pal 2009; IPCC 2014a), the Global Energy Assessment (Roy et al. 2012), and the AR5, which identified sectoral demand-side mitigation options across chapters (IPCC 2014a; IPCC 2014b; Creutzig et al. 2016b). The literature on the nature, scale, implementation and implications of demand-side solutions, and associated changes in lifestyles, social norms, and well-being, has been growing rapidly (Creutzig et al. 2021a) (Box 5.2). Demand-side solutions support near-term climate change mitigation (Méjean et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019) and include consumers’ technology choices, behaviours, lifestyle changes, coupled with production-consumption infrastructures and systems, service provision strategies, and associated socio-technical transitions. This chapter’s assessment of the social sciences (also see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I) reveals that social dynamics at different levels offer diverse entry points for acting on and mitigating climate change (Jorgenson et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Three entry points are relevant for this chapter. First, well-designed demand for services scenarios are consistent with adequate levels of well-being for everyone (Rao and Baer 2012; Grubler et al. 2018; Mastrucci et al. 2020; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), with high and/or improved quality of life (Max-Neef 1995), improved levels of happiness (Easterlin et al. 2010) and sustainable human development (Arrow et al. 2013; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Second, demand-side solutions support staying within planetary boundaries (Haberl et al. 2014; Matson et al. 2016; Hillebrand et al. 2018; Andersen and Quinn 2020; UNDESA 2020; Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021). Demand side solutions entail fewer environmental risks than many supply-side technologies (Von Stechow et al. 2016). Additionally they make carbon dioxide removal technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) less relevant (Van Vuuren et al. 2018) but modelling studies (Grubler et al. 2018; Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021) still require ecosystem-based carbon dioxide removal. In the IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (IPCC 2018), four stylised scenarios have explored possible pathways towards stabilising global warming at 1.5°C (IPCC 2014a, Figure SPM.3a) (Figure 5.1) One of these scenarios, LED-19, investigates the scope of demand-side solutions (Figure 5.1). The comparison of scenarios reveals that such low energy demand pathways eliminate the need for technologies with high uncertainty, such as BECCS. Third, interrogating demand for services from the well-being perspective also opens new avenues for assessing mitigation potentials (Brand-Correa and Steinberger 2017; Mastrucci and Rao 2017; Rao and Min 2018a; Mastrucci and Rao 2019; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021). Arguably, demand-side interventions often operate institutionally or in terms of restoring natural functioning and have so far been politically sidelined but COVID-19 revealed interesting perspectives (Box 5.2). Such demand-side solutions also support near-term goals towards climate change mitigation and reduce the need for politically challenging high global carbon prices (Méjean et al. 2019) (Box 5.11). The well-being focus emphasises equity and universal need satisfaction, compatible with progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Lamb and Steinberger 2017)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The requisites for well-being include collective and social interactions as well as consumption-based material inputs. Moreover, rather than material inputs per se, people need and demand services for dignified survival, sustenance, mobility, communication, comfort and material well-being (Nakićenović et al. 1996b; Johansson et al. 2012; Creutzig et al. 2018). These services may be provided in many different context-specific ways using physical resources (biomass, energy, materials, etc.) and available technologies (e.g., cooking tools, appliances). Here we understand demand as demand for services (often requiring material input), with particular focus on services that are required for well-being (such as lighting, accessibility, shelter, etc.), and that are shaped by culturally and geographically differentiated social aspects, choice architectures and the built environment (infrastructures)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Focusing on demand for services broadens the climate solution space beyond technological switches confined to the supply side, to include solutions that maintain or improve well-being related to nutrition, shelter and mobility while (sometimes radically) reducing energy and material input levels (Creutzig et al. 2018; Cervantes Barron 2020; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021; Kikstra et al. 2021b). This also recognises that mitigation policies are politically, economically and socially more feasible, as well as more effective, when there is a two-way alignment between climate action and well-being (OECD 2019a). There is medium evidence and  high agreement  that well-designed demand for services scenarios are consistent with adequate levels of well-being for everyone (Rao and Baer 2012; Grubler et al. 2018; Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Kikstra et al. 2021b), with high and/or improved quality of life (Max-Neef 1995; Vogel et al. 2021) and improved levels of happiness (Easterlin et al. 2010) and sustainable human development (Gadrey and Jany-Catrice 2006; Arrow et al. 2013; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017). While demand for services is high as development levels increase, and related emissions are growing in many countries (Yumashev et al. 2020; Bamisile et al. 2021), there is also evidence that provisioning systems delink services provided from emissions (Conte Grand 2016; Patra et al. 2017; Kavitha et al. 2020). Various mitigation strategies, often classified into Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) options, effectively reduce primary energy demand and/or material input (Haas et al. 2015; Haberl et al. 2017; Samadi et al. 2017; Hausknost et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2019; Van den Berg et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020). Users’ participation in decisions about how services are provided, not just their technological feasibility, is an important determinant of their effectiveness and sustainability (Whittle et al. 2019; Vanegas Cantarero 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Sector-specific mitigation approaches (Chapters 6–11) emphasise the potential of mitigation via improvements in energy- and materials-efficient manufacturing (Gutowski et al. 2013; Gramkow and Anger-Kraavi 2019; Olatunji et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019), new product design (Fischedick et al. 2014), energy-efficient buildings (Lucon et al. 2014), shifts in diet (Bajželj et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014), transport infrastructure design (Sims et al. 2014), and compact urban forms (Seto et al. 2014). In this chapter, service-related mitigation strategies are categorised as ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’, or ‘Improve’ options to show how mitigation potentials, and social groups who can deliver them, are much broader than usually considered in traditional sector-specific presentations. ASI originally arose from the need to assess the staging and combinations of inter-related mitigation options in the provision of transportation services (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013). In the context of transportation services, ASI seeks to mitigate emissions through avoiding as much transport service demand as possible (e.g., through telework to eliminate commutes, mixed-use urban zoning to shorten commute distances), shifting remaining demand to more efficient modes (e.g., bus rapid transit replacing passenger vehicles), and improving the carbon intensity of modes utilised (e.g., electric buses powered by renewables) (Creutzig et al. 2016a). This chapter summarises ASI options and potentials across sectors and generalises the definitions. ‘Avoid’ refers to all mitigation options that reduce unnecessary (in the sense of being not required to deliver the desired service output) energy consumption by redesigning service provisioning systems; ‘Shift’ refers to the switch to already existing competitive efficient technologies and service provisioning systems; and ‘Improve’ refers to improvements in efficiency in existing technologies. The Avoid-Shift-Improve framing operates in three domains: Socio-cultural, where social norms, culture, and individual choices play an important role – a category especially, but not only, relevant for ‘Avoid’ options; Infrastructure, which provides the cost and benefit landscape for realising options and is particularly relevant for ‘Shift’ options; and Technologies, especially important for the ‘Improve’ options."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’, and ‘Improve’ choices will be made by individuals and households, instigated by salient and respected role models and novel social norms, but will require support by adequate infrastructures designed by urban planners and building and transport professionals, corresponding investments, and a political culture supportive of mitigation action. This is particularly true for many ‘Avoid’ and ‘Shift’ decisions that are difficult because they encounter psychological barriers of breaking routines, habits and imagining new lifestyles and the social costs of not conforming to society (Kaiser 2006). Simpler ‘Improve’ decisions like energy efficiency investments, on the other hand, can be triggered and sustained by traditional policy instruments, complemented by behavioural nudges."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"A key concern about climate change mitigation policies is that they may reduce quality of life. Based on growing literature, in this chapter we adopt the concept of decent living standards (DLS, explained further in relation to other individual and collective well-being measures and concepts in the Social Science Primer, Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I) as a universal set of service requirements essential for achieving basic human well-being. DLS includes the dimensions of nutrition, shelter, living condition, clothing, health care, education, and mobility (Frye et al. 2018; Rao and Min 2018b). DLS provides a fair, direct way to understand the basic low-carbon energy needs of society and specifies the underlying minimum material and energy requirements. This chapter also comprehensively assesses related well-being metrics that result from demand-side action, observing overall positive effects (Section 5.3). Similarly, ambitious low-emissions demand-side scenarios suggest that well-being could be maintained or improved while reducing global final energy demand, and some current literature estimates that it is possible to meet decent living standards for all within the 2°C warming window (Grubler et al. 2018; Burke 2020; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021) (Section 5.4). A key concern here is how to blend new technologies with social change to integrate Improving ways of living, Shifting modalities and Avoiding certain kinds of emissions altogether (Section 5.6)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p10,NO_TITLE,Social practice theory emphasises that material stocks and social relations are key in forming and maintaining habits (Reckwitz 2002; Haberl et al. 2021). This chapter reflects these insights by assessing the role of infrastructures and social norms in GHG emission-intensive or low-carbon lifestyles (Section 5.4).
wg3_ch05_5.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"A core operational principle for sustainable development is equitable access to services to provide well-being for all, while minimising resource inputs and environmental and social externalities/trade-offs, underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals (Princen 2003; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017). Sustainable development is not possible without changes in consumption patterns within the widely recognised constraints of planetary boundaries, resource availability, and the need to provide decent living standards for all (Langhelle 2000; Toth and Szigeti 2016; O’Neill et al. 2018). Inversely, reduced poverty and higher social equity offer opportunities for delinking demand for services from emissions, for example via more long-term decision-making after having escaped poverty traps and by reduced demand for non-well-being-enhancing status consumption (Nabi et al. 2020; Ortega-Ruiz et al. 2020; Parker and Bhatti 2020; Teame and Habte 2020) (Section 5.3)."
wg3_ch05_5.1_p12,NO_TITLE,"Throughout this chapter we discuss how people can realise various opportunities to reduce GHG emission-intensive consumption (Sections 5.2 and 5.3), and act in various roles (Section 5.4), within an enabling environment created by policy instruments and infrastructure that build on social dynamics (Section 5.6)."

wg3_ch05_box-5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"A large part of the literature is highly repetitive and/or includes no concepts or little quantitative or qualitative data of relevance to this chapter. For example, a systematic review on economic growth and decoupling identified more than 11,500 papers treating this topic, but only 834 of those, that is, 7%, included relevant data (Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). In another systematic review, assessing quantitative estimates of consumption-based solutions (Ivanova et al. 2020), only 0.8% of papers were considered after consistency criteria were enforced. Altogether, we relied on systematic reviews wherever possible. Other important papers were not captured by systematic reviews but are included in this chapter through expert judgement. Based on topical modelling and relevance coding of resulting topics, the full literature body can be mapped into two dimensions, where spatial relationships indicate topical distance (Box 5.1, Figure 1). The interpretation of topics demonstrates that the literature organises in four clusters of high relevance for demand-side solutions (housing, mobility, food, and policy), whereas other clusters (nature, energy supply) are relatively less relevant."

Section 5.4 assesses the relevant contribution of different parts of society to climate change mitigation. Section 5.5 evaluates the overall dynamics of social transition processes while Section 5.6 summarises insights on governance and policy packages for demand-side mitigation and well-being.

Many behavioural changes due to COVID-19 reinforce sufficiency and emphasis on solidarity, economies built around care, livelihood protection, collective action, and basic service provision, linked to reduced emissions."
wg3_ch05_box-5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"COVID-19 led to direct and indirect health, economic, and confinement-induced hardships and suffering, mostly for the poor, and reset habits and everyday behaviours of the well-off too, enabling a reflection on the basic needs for a good life. Although COVID-19 and climate change pose different kinds of threats and therefore elicit different policies, there are several lessons from COVID-19 for advancing climate change mitigation (Klenert et al. 2020; Manzanedo and Manning 2020; Stark 2020). Both crises are global in scale, requiring holistic societal response; governments can act rapidly, and delay in action is costly (Bouman et al. 2020a; Klenert et al. 2020). The pandemic highlighted the role of individuals in collective action and many people felt morally compelled and responsible to act for others (Budd and Ison, 2020). COVID-19 also taught the effectiveness of rapid collective action (physical distancing, wearing masks, etc.) as contributions to the public good. The messaging about social distancing, wearing masks and handwashing during the pandemic called attention to the importance of effective public information (e.g., also about reducing personal carbon footprints), recognising that rapid pro-social responses are driven by personal and socio-cultural norms (Bouman et al. 2020a; Sovacool et al. 2020a). In contrast, low trust in public authorities impairs the effectiveness of policies and polarises society (Bavel et al. 2020; Hornsey 2020)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"During the shutdown, emissions declined relatively most in aviation, and absolutely most in car transport (Le Quéré et al. 2020, Sarkis et al. 2020), and there were disproportionally strong reductions in GHG emissions from coal (Bertram et al. 2021) (Chapter 2). At their peak, CO2 emissions in individual countries decreased by 17% on average (Le Quéré et al. 2020). Global energy demand was projected to drop by 5% in 2020, energy-related CO2 emissions by 7%, and energy investment by 18% (IEA 2020a). COVID-19 shock and recovery scenarios project final energy demand reductions of 1–36 EJ yr −1 by 2025 and cumulative CO2 emission reductions of 14–45 GtCO2 by 2030 (Kikstra et al. 2021a). Plastics use and waste generation increased during the pandemic (Klemeš et al. 2020; Prata et al. 2020). Responses to COVID-19 had important connections with energy demand and GHG emissions due to quarantine and travel restrictions (Sovacool et al. 2020a). Reductions in mobility and economic activity reduced energy use in sectors such as industry and transport, but increased energy use in the residential sector (Diffenbaugh et al. 2020). COVID-19 induced behavioural changes that may translate into new habits, some beneficial and some harmful for climate change mitigation. New digitally-enabled service accessibility patterns (videoconferencing, telecommuting) played an important role in sustaining various service needs while avoiding demand for individual mobility. However, public transit lost customers to cars, personalised two wheelers, walking and cycling, while suburban and rural living gained popularity, possibly with long-term consequences. Reduced air travel, pressures for more localised"

If changes in some preference behaviours, for example for larger homes and work environments to enable home working and online education, lead to sprawling suburbs or gentrification with linked environmental consequences, this could translate into long-term implications for climate change (Beaunoyer et al. 2020; Diffenbaugh et al. 2020). Recovering from the pandemic by adopting low energy demand practices – embedded in new travel, work, consumption and production behaviour and patterns – could reduce carbon prices for a 1.5°C consistent pathway by 19%, reduce energy supply investments until 2030 by USD1.8 trillion, and lessen pressure on the upscaling of low-carbon energy technologies (Kikstra et al. 2021a)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"COVID-19 drove hundreds of millions of people below poverty thresholds, reversing decades of poverty reduction accomplishments (Krieger 2020; Mahler et al. 2020; Patel et al. 2020; Sumner et al. 2020) and raising the spectre of intersecting health and climate crises that are devastating for the most vulnerable (Flyvbjerg 2020; Phillips et al. 2020). Like those of climate change, pandemic impacts fall heavily on disadvantaged groups, exacerbate the uneven distribution of future benefits, amplify existing inequities, and introduce new ones (Beaunoyer et al. 2020; Devine-Wright et al. 2020). Addressing such inequities is a positive step towards the social trust that leads to improved climate policies as well as individual actions. Increased support for care workers and social infrastructures within a solidarity economy is consistent with lower-emission economic transformation (Shelley 2017; Di Chiro 2019; Pichler et al. 2019; Smetschka et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Fiscally, the pandemic may have slowed the transition to a sustainable energy world: governments redistributed public funding to combat the disease, adopted austerity and reduced capacity. Of nearly 300 policies implemented to counteract the pandemic, the vast majority are related to rescue, including worker and business compensation, and only 4% of these focus on green policies with potential to reduce GHG emissions in the long term; some rescue policies also assist emissions-intensive business (Hepburn et al. 2020; Leach et al. 2021). However, climate investments can double as the basis of the COVID-19 recovery (Stark 2020), with policies focused on both economic multipliers and climate impacts, such as clean physical infrastructure, natural capital investment, clean research and development (R&D) and education and training (Hepburn et al. 2020). This requires attention to investment priorities, including often-underprioritised social investment, given how inequality intersects with, and is a recognised core driver of, environmental damage and climate change (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"As outlined in section 5.1, mitigation, equity and well-being go hand in hand to motivate actions. Global, regional, and national actions and policies that advance inclusive well-being and build social trust strengthen governance. There is  high evidence and  high agreement  that demand-side measures cut across all sectors, and can bring multiple benefits (Mundaca et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019; Geels 2020; Niamir et al. 2020b; Garvey et al. 2021; Roy et al. 2021).  Since effective demand requires affordability, one of the necessary conditions for acceleration of mitigation through demand-side measures is wide and equitable participation from all sectors of society. Low-cost low-emissions technologies, supported by institutions and government policies, can help meet service demand and advance both climate and well-being goals (Steffen et al. 2018a; Khosla et al. 2019). This section introduces metrics of well-being and their relationship to GHG emissions, and clarifies the concept of service provisioning."
wg3_ch05_5.2.1_p1, Services for Well-being ,"There is  high evidence and  high agreement  in the literature that human well-being and related metrics provide a societal perspective which is inclusive, compatible with sustainable development, and generates multiple ways to mitigate emissions. Development targeted to basic needs and well-being for all entails less carbon intensity than GDP-focused growth (Rao et al. 2014; Lamb and Rao 2015)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.1_p2, Services for Well-being ,"Current socioeconomic systems are based on high-carbon economic growth and resource use (Steffen et al. 2018b). Several systematic reviews confirm that economic growth is tightly coupled with increasing CO2 emissions (Ayres and Warr 2005; Tiba and Omri 2017; Mardani et al. 2019; Wiedenhofer et al. 2020) although the level of emissions depends on inequality (Baležentis et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020b), and on geographic and infrastructural constraints that force consumers to use fossil fuels (Pottier et al. 2021). Different patterns emerge in the causality of the energy–growth nexus: (i) energy consumption causes economic growth; (ii) growth causes energy consumption; (iii) bidirectional causality; and (iv) no significant causality (Ozturk 2010). In a systematic review, Mardani et al. (2019) found that in most cases, energy use and economic growth have a bidirectional causal effect, indicating that as economic growth increases, further CO2 emissions are stimulated at higher levels; in turn, measures designed to lower GHG emissions may reduce economic growth. However, energy substitution and efficiency gains may offer opportunities to break the bidirectional dependency (Komiyama 2014; Brockway et al. 2017; Shuai et al. 2019). Worldwide trends reveal that at best only relative decoupling (resource use grows at a slower pace than GDP) was the norm during the twentieth century (Jackson 2009; Krausmann et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2016; Jackson 2016), while absolute decoupling (when material use declines as GDP grows) is rare, observed only during recessions or periods of low or no economic growth (Heun and Brockway 2019; Hickel and Kallis 2019; Vadén et al. 2020; Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). Recent trends in OECD countries demonstrate the potential for absolute decoupling of economic growth not only from territorial but also from consumption-based emissions (Le Quéré et al. 2019), albeit at scales insufficient for mitigation pathways (Vadén et al. 2020) (Chapter 2)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.1_p3, Services for Well-being ,"Energy demand and demand for GHG-intensive products increased from 2010 until 2020 across all sectors and categories. 2019 witnessed a reduction in energy demand growth rate to below 1% and 2020 an overall decline in energy demand, with repercussions for energy supply disproportionally affecting coal via merit order effects (Bertram et al. 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). There was a slight but significant shift from high-carbon beef consumption to medium-carbon intensive poultry consumption. Final energy use in buildings grew from 118 EJ in 2010 to around 128 EJ in 2019 (increased about 8%). The highest increase was observed in non-residential buildings, with a 13% increase against 8% in residential energy demand (IEA 2019a). While electricity accounted for one-third of building energy use in 2019, fossil fuel use also increased at a marginal annual average growth rate of 0.7% since 2010 (IEA 2020a). Energy-related CO2 emissions from buildings have risen in recent years after flattening between 2013 and 2016. Direct and indirect emissions from electricity and commercial heat used in buildings rose to 10 GtCO2 in 2019, the highest level ever recorded. Several factors have contributed to this rise, including growing energy demand for heating and cooling with rising air conditioner ownership and extreme weather events. A critical issue remains how comfortable people feel with temperatures they will be exposed to in the future and this depends on physical, psychological and behavioural factors (Singh et al. 2018; Jacobs et al. 2019). Literature now shows  high evidence and  high agreement  around the observation that policies and infrastructure interventions that lead to change in human preferences are more valuable for climate change mitigation. In economics, welfare evaluations are predominantly based on the preference approach. Preferences are typically assumed to be fixed, so that only changes in relative prices will reduce emissions. However, as decarbonisation is a societal transition, individuals’ preferences do shift and this can contribute to climate change mitigation (Gough 2015). Even if preferences are assumed to change in response to policy, it is nevertheless possible to evaluate policy, and demand-side solutions, by approaches to well-being and welfare that are based on deeper concepts of preferences across disciplines (Roy and Pal 2009; Fleurbaey and Tadenuma 2014; Komiyama 2014; Dietrich and List 2016; Mattauch and Hepburn 2016). In cases of past societal transitions, such as smoking reduction, there is evidence that societies guided the processes of shifting preferences, and values changed along with changing relative prices (Nyborg and Rege 2003; Stuber et al. 2008; Brownell and Warner 2009). Further evidence on changing preferences in consumption choices pertinent to decarbonisation includes Grinblatt et al. (2008) and Weinberger and Goetzke (2010) for mobility; Erb et al. (2016), Muller et al. (2017), and Costa and Johnson (2019) for diets; and Baranzini et al. (2017) for solar panel uptake. If individuals’ preferences and values change during a transition to the low-carbon economy, then this overturns conclusions on what count as adequate or even optimal policy responses to climate change mitigation in economics (Jacobsen et al. 2012; Schumacher 2015; Dasgupta et al. 2016; Daube and Ulph 2016; Ulph and Ulph 2021). In particular, if policy instruments, such as awareness campaigns, infrastructure development or education, can change people’s preferences, then policies or infrastructure provision – socially constrained by deliberative decision making – which change both relative prices and preferences, are more valuable for mitigation than previously thought (Creutzig et al. 2016b; Mattauch et al. 2016; Mattauch et al. 2018). The provisioning context of human needs is participatory, so transformative mitigation potential arises from social as well as technological change (Lamb and Steinberger 2017). Many dimensions of well-being and ‘basic needs’ are social, not individual, in character (Schneider 2016), so extending well-being and DLS analysis to emissions also involves understanding individual situations in social contexts. This includes building supports for collective strategies to reduce emissions (Chan et al. 2019), going beyond individual consumer choice. Climate policies that affect collective behaviour fairly are the most acceptable policies across political ideologies (Clayton 2018); thus collective preferences for mitigation are synergistic with evolving policies and norms in governance contexts that reduce risk, ensure social justice and build trust (Atkinson et al. 2017; Cramton et al. 2017; Milkoreit 2017; Tvinnereim et al. 2017; Smith and Reid 2018; Carattini et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.1_p4, Services for Well-being ,"Because of data limitations, which can make cross-country comparisons difficult, health-based indicators and in particular life expectancy (Lamb et al. 2014) have sometimes been proposed as quick and practical ways to compare local or national situations, climate impacts, and policy effects (Decancq et al. 2009; Sager 2017; Burstein et al. 2019). A number of different well-being metrics are valuable in emphasising the constituents of what is needed for a decent life in different dimensions (Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Porter et al. 2017; Smith and Reid 2018). The SDGs overlap in many ways with such indicators, and the data needed to assess progress in meeting the SDGs is also useful for quantifying well-being (Gough 2017). For the purposes of this chapter, indicators directly relating GHG emissions to well-being for all are particularly relevant."
wg3_ch05_5.2.1_p5, Services for Well-being ,"Well-being can be categorised either as ‘hedonic’ or ‘eudaimonic’. Hedonic well-being is related to a subjective state of human motivation, balancing pleasure over pain, and has gained influence in psychology assessing ‘subjective well-being’, assuming that the individual is motivated to enhance personal freedom, self-preservation and enhancement (Sirgy 2012; Brand-Correa and Steinberger 2017; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Ganglmair-Wooliscroft and Wooliscroft 2019). Eudaimonic well-being focuses on the individual in the broader context, associating happiness with virtue (Sirgy 2012), allowing for the creation of social institutions and political systems and considering their ability to enable individuals to flourish. Eudaimonic analysis supports numerous development approaches (Fanning and O’Neill 2019) such as the capabilities (Sen 1985), human needs (Doyal and Gough 1991; Max-Neef et al. 1991) and models of psychosocial well-being (Ryan and Deci 2001). Measures of well-being differ somewhat in developed and developing countries (Sulemana et al. 2016; Ng and Diener 2019); for example, food insecurity, associated everywhere with lower subjective well-being, is more strongly associated with poor subjective well-being in more-developed countries (Frongillo et al. 2019); in wealthier countries, the relationship between living in rural areas is less strongly associated with negative well-being than in less-developed countries (Requena 2016); and income inequality is negatively associated with subjective well-being in developed countries, but positively so in less-developed countries (Ngamaba et al. 2018). This chapter connects demand-side climate mitigation options to multiple dimensions of well-being, going beyond the single dimensional metric of GDP which is at the core of IAMs. Many demand side-mitigation solutions generate positive and negative impacts on wider dimensions of human well-being which are not always quantifiable (medium evidence, medium agreement ). "
wg3_ch05_5.2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Well-being needs are met through services. Provision of services associated with low energy demand is a key component of current and future efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Services can be provided in various culturally-appropriate ways, with diverse climate implications. There is  high evidence and  high agreement  in the literature that many granular service provision systems can make ‘demand’ more flexible, provide new options for mitigation, support access to basic needs, and enhance human well-being. Energy services offer an important lens to analyse the relationship between energy systems and human well-being (Jackson and Papathanasopoulou 2008; Druckman and Jackson 2010; Mattioli 2016; Walker et al. 2016; Fell 2017; Brand-Correa et al. 2018; King et al. 2019; Pagliano and Erba 2019; Whiting et al. 2020). Direct and indirect services provided by energy, rather than energy itself, deliver well-being benefits (Kalt et al. 2019). For example, illumination and transport are intermediary services in relation to education, health care, meal preparation, sanitation, and so on, which are basic human needs. Sustainable consumption and production revolve around ‘doing more and better with the same’ and thereby increasing well-being from economic activities ‘by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution along the whole lifecycle, while increasing quality of life’ (UNEP 2010). Although energy is required for delivering human development by supporting access to basic needs (Lamb and Rao 2015; Lamb and Steinberger 2017), a reduction in primary energy use and/or shift to low-carbon energy, if associated with the maintenance or improvement of services, can not only ensure better environmental quality but also directly enhance well-being (Roy et al. 2012). The correlation between human development and emissions is not necessarily coupled in the long term, which implies there is a need to prioritise human well-being and the environment over economic growth (Steinberger et al. 2020). At the interpersonal and community levels, cultural specificities, infrastructure, norms, and relational behaviours differ (Box 5.3). For example, demand for space heating and cooling depends on building materials and designs, urban planning, vegetation, clothing and social norms as well as geography, incomes, and outside temperatures (Brand-Correa et al. 2018; Campbell et al. 2018; Ivanova et al. 2018; IEA 2019b; Dreyfus et al. 2020). In personal mobility, different variable needs satisfiers (e.g., street space allocated to cars, buses or bicycles) can help satisfy human needs, such as accessibility to jobs, health care, and education. Social interactions and normative values play a crucial role in determining energy demand. Hence, demand-side and service-oriented mitigation strategies are most effective if geographically and culturally differentiated (Niamir et al. 2020a)."

Therefore, one key way of thinking about providing well-being for all with low carbon emissions centres around prioritising ways of providing services for DLS in a low-carbon way (including choices of needs satisfiers, and how these are provided or made accessible).

The lowest population quartile by income worldwide faces glaring shortfalls in housing, mobility, and nutrition. Meeting these service needs using low-emissions energy sources is a top priority. Reducing GHG emissions associated with high levels of consumption and material throughput by those far above DLS levels has potential to address both emissions and inequality in energy and emission footprints (Otto et al. 2019). This, in turn, has further potential benefits; under the conditions of ‘fair’ income reallocation to public services, this can reduce national carbon footprint by up to 30% while allowing the consumption of those at the bottom to increase (Millward-Hopkins and Oswald 2021). The challenge then is to address the upper limits of consumption. When consumption only just supports the satisfaction of basic needs, any decrease causes deficiencies in human-need satisfaction. This is quite unlinke the case of consumption that exceeds the limits of basic needs, in which deprivation causes a subjective discomfort (Brand-Correa et al. 2020). Therefore, to collectively remain within environmental limits, the establishment of minimum and maximum standards of consumption, or sustainable consumption corridors, (Wiedmann et al. 2020) has been suggested, depending on the context. In some countries, carbon-intensive ways of satisfying human needs have been locked-in, for example via car-dependent infrastructures (Jackson and Papathanasopoulou 2008; Druckman and Jackson 2010; Mattioli 2016; King et al. 2019), and both infrastructure reconfiguration and adaptation are required to organise need satisfaction in low-carbon ways (see also Section 10.2)."

Vital dimensions of well-being correlate with consumption, but only up to a threshold: decent living energy thresholds range from about 13 to 18.4 GJ cap –1 yr –1 of final energy consumption but the current consumption ranges from under 5 GJ cap –1 yr –1 to over 200 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), thus a mitigation strategy that protects minimum levels of essential-goods service delivery for DLS, but critically views consumption beyond the point of diminishing returns of needs satisfaction, is able to sustain well-being while generating emissions reductions (Goldemberg et al. 1988; Jackson and Marks 1999; Druckman and Jackson 2010; Girod and De Haan 2010; Vita et al. 2019a; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021).

wg3_ch05_5.2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is very  high evidence and very high agreement  that globally, there are differences in the amount of energy that societies require to provide the basic needs for everyone. At present nearly one-third of the world’s population are ‘energy poor’, facing challenges in both access and affordability, that is, more than 2.6 billion people have little or no access to energy for clean cooking. About 1.2 billion lack energy for cleaning, sanitation and water supply, lighting, and basic livelihood tasks (Sovacool and Drupady 2016; Rao and Pachauri 2017).The current per capita energy requirement to provide a decent standard of living range from around 5 to 200 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Steckel et al. 2013; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), which shows the level of inequality that exists; this depends on the context, such as geography, culture, infrastructure or how services are provided (Brand-Correa et al. 2018) (Box 5.3). However, through efficient technologies and radical demand-side transformations, the final energy requirements for providing DLS by 2050 is estimated at 15.3 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). Recent DLS estimates for Brazil, South Africa, and India are in the range between 15 and 25 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Rao et al. 2019b).The most gravely energy poor are often those living in informal settlements, particularly women, in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, whose socially-determined responsibilities for food, water, and care are highly labour-intensive and made more intense by climate change (Guruswamy 2016; Wester et al. 2019). In Brazil, India and South Africa, where inequality is extreme (Alvaredo et al. 2018) mobility (51–60%), food production and preparation (21–27%) and housing (5–12%) dominate total energy needs (Rao et al. 2019b). Minimum requirements of energy use consistent with enabling well-being for all is between 20 and 50 GJ cap –1 yr –1 depending on context (Rao et al. 2019b). Inequality in access to and availability of services for human well-being varies in extreme degree across countries and income groups. In developing countries, the bottom 50% receive about 10% of the energy used in land transport and less than 5% in air transport, while the top 10% use about 45% of the energy for land transport and around 75% for air transport (Oswald et al. 2020). Within-country analysis shows that particular groups in China – women born in the rural West with disadvantaged family backgrounds – face unequal opportunities for energy consumption (Shi 2019). Figure 5.3 shows the wide variation across world regions in people’s access to some of the basic material prerequisites for meeting DLS, and variations in energy consumption, providing a starting point for comparative global analysis."
wg3_ch05_box-5.3_p1,Variations in Energy Use ,"Acceleration in mitigation action needs to be understood from a societal perspective. Technologies, access and service equity factors sometimes change rapidly. Access to technologies, infrastructures and products, and the services they provide, are essential for raising global living standards and improving human well-being (Alkire and Santos 2014; Rao and Min 2018b). Yet access to and levels of service delivery are distributed extremely inequitably as of now. How fast such inequities can be reduced by granular end-use technologies is illustrated by the cellphone (households with mobiles), comparing the situation between 2000 and 2018. In this eighteen-year period, cellphones changed from a very inequitably-distributed technology to one with almost universal access, bringing accessibility benefits especially to populations with very low disposable income and to those whose physical mobility is limited (Porter 2016). Every human has the right to a dignified decent life, to live in good health and to participate in society. This is a daunting challenge, requiring that in the next decade governments build out infrastructure to provide billions of people with access to a number of services and basic amenities in comfortable homes, nutritious food, and transit options (Rao and Min 2018b). For a long time, this challenge was thought to also be an impediment to developing countries’ participation in global climate mitigation efforts. However, recent research shows that this need not be the case (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Rao et al. 2019b)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.3_p2,Variations in Energy Use ,"Several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN 2015) deal with providing access to technologies and service infrastructures to the share of population so far excluded, showing that the UN 2030 Agenda has adopted a multidimensional perspective on poverty. Multidimensional poverty indices, such as the Social Progress Indicator and the Individual Deprivation Measure, go beyond income and focus on tracking the delivery of access to basic services by the poorest population groups, both in developing countries (Fulton et al. 2009; Alkire and Santos 2014; Alkire and Robles 2017; Rao and Min 2018b), and in developed countries (Townsend 1979; Aaberge and Brandolini 2015; Eurostat 2018). At the same time, the SDGs, primarily SDG 10 on reducing inequalities within and among countries, promote a more equitable world, both in terms of inter- as well as intra-national equality."
wg3_ch05_box-5.3_p3,Variations in Energy Use ,"Access to various end-use technologies and infrastructure services features directly in the SDG targets and among the indicators used to track their progress (UN 2015; UNESC 2017): Basic services in households (SDG 1.4.1), Improved water sources (SDG 6.1.1); Improved sanitation (SDG 6.1.2); Electricity (SDG 7.1.1); Internet – fixed broadband subscriptions (SDG 17.6.2); Internet – proportion of population using (SDG 17.8.1). Transport (public transit, cars, mopeds or bicycles) and media technologies (mobile phones, TVs, radios, PCs, Internet) can be seen as proxies for access to mobility and communication, crucial for participation in society and the economy (Smith et al. 2015). In addition, SDG 10 is a more conventional income-based inequality goal, referring to income inequality (SDG 10.1), social, economic and political inclusion of all (SDG 10.2.), and equal opportunities and reduced inequalities of outcome (SDG 10.3)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is  high evidence and  high agreement  in the literature that through equitable distribution, well-being for all can be assured at the lowest-possible energy consumption levels (Steinberger and Roberts 2010; Oswald et al. 2020) by reducing emissions related to consumption as much as possible, while assuring DLS for everyone (Annecke 2002; de Zoysa 2011; Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2013; Spangenberg 2014; Toroitich and Kerber 2014; Kenner 2015; Toth and Szigeti 2016; Smil 2017; Otto et al. 2019; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021). For example, at similar levels of human development, per capita energy demand in the US was 63% higher than in Germany (Arto et al. 2016); those patterns are explained by context in terms of various climate, cultural and historical factors influencing consumption. Context matters even in within-country analysis, for example, electricity consumption in the US shows that efficiency innovations do exert positive influence on savings of residential energy consumption, but the relationship is mixed; on the contrary, affluence (household income and home size) and context (geographical location) drive resource utilisation significantly (Adua and Clark 2019); affluence is central to any future prospect in terms of environmental conditions (Wiedmann et al. 2020). In China, inequality of energy consumption and expenditure varies highly depending on the energy type, end-use demand and climatic region (Wu et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Consumption is energy- and materials-intensive and expands along with income. About half of the energy used in the world is consumed by the richest 10% of people, most of whom live in developed countries, especially when one includes the energy embodied in the goods they purchase from other countries and the structure of consumption as a function of income level (Arto et al. 2016; Wolfram et al. 2016; Santillán Vera et al. 2021). International trade plays a central role, being responsible for shifting burdens in most cases from low-income developing countries producers to high-income developed countries as consumers (Wiedmann et al. 2020). China is the largest exporter to the EU and United States, and accounts for nearly half and 40% of their imports in energy use respectively (Wu et al. 2019). Wealthy countries have exported or outsourced their climate and energy crisis to low- and middle-income countries (Baker 2018), exacerbated by intensive international trade (Steinberger et al. 2012; Scherer et al. 2018). Therefore, issues of total energy consumption are inseparably related to the energy inequity among the countries and regions of the world."
wg3_ch05_5.2.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Within the energy use induced by global consumer products, household consumption is the biggest contributor, contributing to around three-quarters of the global total (Wu et al. 2019). A more granular analysis of household energy consumption reveals that the lowest two quintiles in countries with average annual income below USD15,000 cap –1 yr –1 consume less energy than the international energy requirements for DLS (20–50 GJ cap –1); 77% of people consume less than 30 GJ cap –1 yr –1 and 38% consume less than 10 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Oswald et al. 2020). Many energy-intensive goods have high price elasticity (>1.0), implying that growing incomes lead to over-proportional growth of energy footprints in these consumption categories. Highly unequally distributed energy consumption is concentrated in the transport sector, ranging from vehicle purchase to fuels, and most unequally in package holidays and aviation (Gössling 2019; Oswald et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Socio-economic dynamics and outcomes affect whether provisioning of goods and services is achieved at low energy demand levels (Figure 5.4). Specifically, multivariate regression shows that public service quality, income equality, democracy, and electricity access enable higher need satisfaction at lower energy demand, whereas extractivism and economic growth beyond moderate levels of affluence reduce need satisfaction at higher energy demand (Vogel et al. 2021). Altogether, this demonstrates that at a given level of energy provided, there is large scope to improve service levels for well-being by modifying socio-economic context without increasing energy supply (Figure 5.4)."
wg3_ch05_5.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The carbon footprint of a nation is equal to the direct emissions occurring due to households’ transport, heating and cooking, as well as the impact embodied in the production of all consumed goods and services (Wiedmann and Minx 2008; Davis and Caldeira 2010; Hübler 2017; Vita et al. 2019a). There are large differences in carbon footprints between the poor and the rich. As a result of energy use inequality, the lowest global emitters (the poorest 10% in developing countries) in 2013 emitted about 0.1 tCO2 cap –1 yr –1, whereas the highest global emitters (the top 1% in the richest countries) emitted about 200–300 tCO2 cap –1 yr –1 (World Bank 2019). The poorest 50% of the world’s population are responsible for only about 10% of total lifetime consumption emissions, in contrast about 50% of the world’s GHG emissions can be attributed to consumption by the world’s richest 10%, with the average carbon footprint of the richest being 175 times higher than that of the poorest 10% (Chancel and Piketty 2015). This richest 10% consumed the global carbon budget by nearly 30% during the period 1990–2015 (Kartha et al. 2020; Gore 2020). While mitigation efforts often focus on the poorest, the lifestyle and consumption patterns of the affluent often influence the growing middle class (Otto et al. 2019). Across EU countries, only 5% of households are living within 1.5°C climate limits and the top 1% emit more than 22 times the target on average, with land and air transport being particular characteristics of the highest-emitting countries (Ivanova and Wood 2020)."

Global CO2 emissions remain concentrated: the top 10% of emitters contribute about 35–45% of the total, while the bottom 50% contribute just 13–15% of global emissions (Chancel and Piketty 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017).

Context matters even in within-country analysis, for example, electricity consumption in the US shows that efficiency innovations do exert positive influence on savings of residential energy consumption, but the relationship is mixed; on the contrary, affluence (household income and home size) and context (geographical location) drive resource utilisation significantly (Adua and Clark 2019); affluence is central to any future prospect in terms of environmental conditions (Wiedmann et al. 2020).

International trade plays a central role, being responsible for shifting burdens in most cases from low-income developing countries producers to high-income developed countries as consumers (Wiedmann et al. 2020). China is the largest exporter to the EU and United States, and accounts for nearly half and 40% of their imports in energy use respectively (Wu et al. 2019). Wealthy countries have exported or outsourced their climate and energy crisis to low- and middle-income countries (Baker 2018), exacerbated by intensive international trade (Steinberger et al. 2012; Scherer et al. 2018).

Many energy-intensive goods have high price elasticity (>1.0), implying that growing incomes lead to over-proportional growth of energy footprints in these consumption categories.

There are large differences in carbon footprints between the poor and the rich. As a result of energy use inequality, the lowest global emitters (the poorest 10% in developing countries) in 2013 emitted about 0.1 tCO2 cap –1 yr –1, whereas the highest global emitters (the top 1% in the richest countries) emitted about 200–300 tCO2 cap –1 yr –1 (World Bank 2019). The poorest 50% of the world’s population are responsible for only about 10% of total lifetime consumption emissions, in contrast about 50% of the world’s GHG emissions can be attributed to consumption by the world’s richest 10%, with the average carbon footprint of the richest being 175 times higher than that of the poorest 10% (Chancel and Piketty 2015). This richest 10% consumed the global carbon budget by nearly 30% during the period 1990–2015 (Kartha et al. 2020; Gore 2020). While mitigation efforts often focus on the poorest, the lifestyle and consumption patterns of the affluent often influence the growing middle class (Otto et al. 2019). Across EU countries, only 5% of households are living within 1.5°C climate limits and the top 1% emit more than 22 times the target on average, with land and air transport being particular characteristics of the highest-emitting countries (Ivanova and Wood 2020)."

Climate-related injustices are addressed where equity is prioritised (Klinsky and Winkler 2014). Thus, there is high confidence in the literature that addressing inequities in income, wealth, and DLS not only raises overall well-being and furthers the SDGs but also improves the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies. For example, job creation, retraining for new jobs, local production of livelihood necessities, social provisioning, and other positive steps toward climate mitigation and adaptation are all associated with more equitable and resilient societies (Okvat and Zautra 2011; Bentley 2014; Klinsky et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2018a). At all scales of governance, the popularity and sustainability of climate policies requires attention to the fairness of their health and economic implications for all, and participatory engagement across social groups – a responsible development framing (Cazorla and Toman 2001; Dulal et al. 2009; Chuku 2010; Shonkoff et al. 2011; Navroz 2019; Hofstad and Vedeld 2020; Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Roy and Schaffartzik 2020; Temper et al. 2020; Waller et al. 2020). Far from being secondary or even a distraction from climate mitigation priorities, an equity focus is intertwined with mitigation goals (Klinsky et al. 2016). Demand-side climate mitigation options have pervasive ancillary, equity-enhancing benefits, for example for health, local livelihoods, and community forest resources (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009; Garg 2011; Shaw et al. 2014; Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015; Klausbruckner et al. 2016; Salas and Jha 2019) (Figure 5.6).

Systems-dynamics models linking strong emissions-reducing policies and strong social equity policies show that a low-carbon transition in conjunction with social sustainability is possible, even without economic growth (Kallis et al. 2012; Jackson and Victor 2016; Stuart et al. 2017; Chapman and Fraser 2019; D’Alessandro et al. 2019; Gabriel and Bond 2019; Huang et al. 2019; Victor 2019).

Institutional transformation may also result from socio-ecological stresses that accompany climate change, leading to more effective governance structures (David Tàbara et al. 2018; Patterson and Huitema 2019; Barnes et al. 2020). An appropriate, context-specific mix of options facilitated by policies can deliver both higher well-being and reduced disparity in access to basic needs for services concurrently with  climate mitigation (Thomas and Twyman 2005; Mearns and Norton 2009; Klinsky and Winkler 2014; Lamb et al. 2014; Lamb and Steinberger 2017). Hence, nurturing equitable human well-being through provision of decent living standards for all goes hand in hand with climate change mitigation (ISSC et al. 2016; OECD 2019a).

Greater public participation in climate policy processes and governance, by increasing the diversity of ideas and stakeholders, builds resilience and allows broader societal transformation towards systemic change, even in complex, dynamic and contested contexts (Dombrowski 2010; Wise et al. 2014; Haque et al. 2015; Jodoin et al. 2015; Mitchell 2015; Kaiser 2020; Alegria 2021). This sometimes involves complex policy discussions that can lead to governance innovations, also influencing social norms (Martinez 2020). A specific example are citizen assemblies, deliberating public policy challenges, such as climate change (Devaney et al. 2020). Activist climate movements are changing policies as well as normative values (Section 5.4 and the Social Science Primer, Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I). Environmental justice and climate justice activists worldwide have called attention to the links between economic and environmental inequities, collected and publicised data about them, and demanded stronger mitigation (Goodman 2009; Schlosberg and Collins 2014; Jafry 2019; Cheon 2020). Youth climate activists, and Indigenous leaders, are also exerting growing political influence towards mitigation (Helferty and Clarke 2009; White 2011; Powless 2012; Petheram et al. 2015; UN 2015; Curnow and Gross 2016; Grady-Benson and Sarathy 2016; Claeys and Delgado Pugley 2017; O’Brien et al. 2018; Rowlands and Gomez Peña 2019; Bergmann and Ossewaarde 2020; Han and Ahn 2020; Nkrumah 2021). Indigenous resurgence (activism fuelled by ongoing colonial social and environmental injustices, land claims, and deep spiritual and cultural commitment to environmental protection) not only strengthens climate leadership in many countries, but also changes broad social norms by raising knowledge of Indigenous governance systems which supported sustainable lifeways over thousands of years (Wildcat 2014; Chanza and De Wit 2016; Whyte 2017; Whyte 2018, Temper et al. 2020).

Inter-personal trust among citizens often promotes pro-environment behaviour by influencing perceptions (Harring and Jagers 2013), enhancing cooperation, and reducing free-riding and opportunistic behaviour (Gür 2020). Individual support for carbon taxes and energy innovations falls when collective community support is lacking (Bolsen et al. 2014; Smith and Mayer 2018; Simon 2020).

For example, inequities in income and in the ownership and control of household assets, familial responsibilities due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine women’s ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain physical and mental health and well-being (Chandra et al. 2017; Eastin 2018; Das et al. 2019). Studies during the COVID-19 crisis have found that, in general, women’s economic and productive lives have been affected disproportionately to men’s (Alon et al. 2020; ILO 2020).

Women’s work and decision-making are central in the food chain and agricultural output in most developing countries, and in household management everywhere. Emissions from cooking fuels can cause serious health damage, and unsustainable extraction of biofuels can also hurt mitigation (Bailis et al. 2015), so considering health, biodiversity and climate tradeoffs and co-benefits is important (Rosenthal et al. 2018; Aberilla et al. 2020; Mazorra et al. 2020). Policies on energy use and consumption are often focused on technical issues related to energy supply, thereby overlooking demand-side factors such as household decision-making, unpaid work, livelihoods and care (Himmelweit 2002; Perch 2011; Fumo 2014; Hans et al. 2019; Huyer and Partey 2020).

Women’s carbon footprints are about 6–28% lower than men’s (with high variation across countries), mostly based on their lower meat consumption and lower vehicle use (Isenhour and Ardenfors 2009; Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2009; Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2010; Barnett et al. 2012; Medina and Toledo-Bruno 2016; Ahmad et al. 2017; Fernström Nåtby and Rönnerfalk 2018; Li et al. 2019). Gender-based income redistribution in the form of pay equity for women could reduce emissions if the redistribution is revenue neutral (Terry 2009; Dengler and Strunk 2018).

This underscores the important synergies between equity and mitigation. The contributions of women, racialised people, and indigenous people, who are socially positioned as those first and most affected by climate change – and therefore experts on appropriate climate responses – are substantial (Dankelman and Jansen 2010; Wickramasinghe 2015; Black 2016; Vinyeta et al. 2016; Pearse 2017). Equitable power, participation, and agency in climate policymaking is hence an effective contribution for improving governance and decision-making on climate change mitigation (Reckien et al. 2017; Collins 2019).

To identify such a solution space, this section summarises socio-cultural, technological and infrastructural interventions through the Avoid-Shift-Improve concept. ASI (Section 5.1) provides a categorisation of options aimed at continuously eliminating waste in the current systems of service provision (Section 5.3.1.1). It also concisely presents demand-side options to reduce GHG emissions by individual choices which can be leveraged by supporting policies, technologies and infrastructure. Two key concepts for evaluating the efficiency of service provision systems are: resource cascades and exergy. These concepts provide powerful analytical lenses through which to identify and substantially reduce energy and resource waste in service provision systems, both for decent living standards (Section 5.3.2) and higher well-being levels. They typically focus on end-use conversion and service delivery improvements as the most influential opportunities for system-wide waste reductions. Review of the state of modelling low energy and resource demand pathways in long-term climate mitigation scenarios (recognising the importance of such scenarios for illuminating technology and policy pathways for more efficient service provision) and summary of the mitigation potentials estimated from relevant scenarios to date are in Section 5.3.3. Finally, it reviews the role of three megatrends that are transforming delivery of services in innovative ways – digitalisation, the sharing economy, and the circular economy (Section 5.3.4). The review of megatrends makes an assessment highlighting the potential risks of rebound effects, and even accelerated consumption; it also scopes for proactive and vigilant policies to harness their potential for future energy and resource demand reductions, and, conversely, avoiding undesirable outcomes."

The sharing economy, digitalisation, and the circular economy can all contribute to ASI strategies, with the circular economy tentatively more on the supply side, and the sharing economy and digitalisation tentatively more on the demand side (Section 5.3.4). These new service delivery models go beyond sectoral boundaries (IPCC sector chapter boundaries are explained in Chapter 12) and take advantage of technological innovations, design concepts, and innovative forms of cooperation, cutting across sectors to contribute to systemic changes worldwide. Some of these changes can be realised in the short term, such as energy access, while others may take a longer period, such as radical and systemic eco-innovations like shared electric autonomous vehicles.

wg3_ch05_5.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Opportunities for avoiding waste associated with the provision of services, or avoiding overprovision of or excess demand for services, exist across multiple service categories. ‘Avoid’ options are relevant in all end-use sectors, namely, teleworking and avoiding long-haul flights, adjusting dwelling size to household size, and avoiding short-lifespan products and food waste. Cities and built environments can play an additional role. For example, more compact designs and higher accessibility reduce travel demand and translate into lower average floor space and corresponding heating/cooling and lighting demand, and thus reductions of between 5% to 20% of GHG emissions of end-use sectors (Creutzig et al. 2021b). Avoidance of food loss and wastage – which equalled 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2010–2016 (Mbow et al. 2019), while millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition – is a prime example (Chapter 12). A key challenge in meeting global nutrition services is therefore to avoid food loss and waste while simultaneously raising nutrition levels to equitable standards globally. Literature results indicate that in developed economies, consumers are the largest source of food waste, and that behavioural changes such as meal planning, use of leftovers, and avoidance of over-preparation can be important service-oriented solutions (Gunders et al. 2017; Schanes et al. 2018), while improvements to expiration labels by regulators would reduce unnecessary disposal of unexpired items (Wilson et al. 2017) and improved preservation in supply chains would reduce spoilage (Duncan and Gulbahar 2019).

Coupling food waste reductions with dietary shifts can further reduce energy, land, and resource demand in upstream food provision systems, leading to substantial GHG emissions benefits. The estimated technical potential for GHG emissions reductions associated with shifts to sustainable healthy diets is 0.5–8 GtCO2-eq ( high confidence) (Smith et al. 2013; Jarmul et al. 2020; Creutzig et al. 2021b) (Figure 5.7, Table 12.2). Current literature on health, diets, and emissions indicates that sustainable food systems providing healthy diets for all are within reach but require significant cross-sectoral action, including improved agricultural practices, dietary shifts among consumers, and food waste reductions in production, distribution, retail, and consumption (Erb et al. 2016; Muller et al. 2017; Graça et al. 2019; Willett and al. 2019) (Table 12.9)."

Deforestation is the second-largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, caused mainly by expanding forestry and agriculture, and in many cases this agricultural expansion is driven by trade demand for food. For example, across the tropics, cattle and oilseed products account for half the deforestation carbon emissions, embodied in international trade to China and Europe (Creutzig et al. 2019a; Pendrill et al. 2019). Benefits from shifts in diets and resulting lowered land pressure are also reflected in reductions of land degradation and emissions."

Modelling based on a plethora of bottom-up insights and options reveals that a balanced portfolio of ASI policies brings global transport sector emissions in line with global warming of not more than 1.5°C (Gota et al. 2019). For example, telework may be a significant lever for avoiding road transport associated with daily commutes, achievable through digitalisation, but its savings depend heavily on the modes, distances, and types of office use avoided (Hook et al. 2020) and whether additional travel is induced due to greater available time (Mokhtarian 2002) or vehicle use by other household members (Kim et al. 2015; de Abreu e Silva and Melo 2018). More robustly, avoiding kilometres travelled through improved urban planning and smart logistical systems can lead to fuel, and, hence, emissions savings (Creutzig et al. 2015a; IEA 2016; IEA 2017a; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018), or through avoiding long-haul flights (IEA 2021). For example, reallocating road and parking space to exclusive public transit lanes, protected bike lanes and pedestrian priority streets can reduce vehicle kilometres travelled in urban areas (ITF 2021). At the vehicle level, lightweighting strategies (Fischedick et al. 2014) and avoiding inputs of carbon-intensive materials into vehicle manufacturing can also lead to significant emissions savings through improved fuel economy (Das et al. 2016; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b)."

Active mobility, such as walking and cycling, has 2–10% potential in GHG emissions reduction. Well designed teleworking policies can reduce transport-related GHG emissions by at least 1%. A systematic review demonstrates that 26 of 39 studies identified suggest that teleworking reduces energy use, induced mainly by distance travelled, and only eight studies suggest that teleworking increases or has a neutral impact on energy use (Hook et al. 2020). Infrastructure use (specifically urban planning and shared pooled mobility) has about 20–50% (on average) potential in land transport GHG emissions reduction, especially via redirecting the ongoing design of existing infrastructures in developing countries, and with 30% as our central estimate (Section 5.3.4.2). Technology adoption, particularly banning combustion and diesel engines and 100% EV targets (and other zero-carbon fuels, especially in freight) and efficient lightweight cars, can contribute to between 30% and 70% of GHG emissions reduction from land transport in 2050, with 50% as our central estimate (see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2 and Chapter 10, Sections 10.4 and 10.7), consistent with scenario modelling (Figure 10.27) and based on rapid reduction in the GHG emission footprint of vehicle production. These numbers are consistent with the end of fossil fuel-based new cars in 2035 in major economies and of 100% of vehicles being zero-emission vehicles in 2050. Other economies that display vehicles obtained on second hand markets may phase out fossil fuel cars only after 2050, hence limiting the overall mitigation potential of electric vehicles to well below 100% in 2050. Higher energy use and CO2-footprint in BEV production compared to ICE production are to be met with more rapid decarbonisation of the industry sector and by the reduced need for overall vehicle stock, due to socio-cultural and infrastructure measures. Ehrenberger et al. (2021) shows that the development of technologies, fleets, and their use are decisive factors in reducing the use of fossil energies, resulting in 26–65% CO2 emissions reduction potential until 2040 for the case of Germany. Electric vehicles can be used to provide new shared services. In this case, reductions of CO2 emissions of close to 20% can be obtained in a scenario where 20% of car trips and all bus feeder trips are replaced, but considerably higher reductions are possible when shared pooled mobility replaces private vehicle trips in urban areas (ITF 2017b, ITF 2017d). A study shows that ICE vehicles reduce CO2 emissions to 60% or 80% of current emissions levels by 2050 (Hill et al. 2019). Similarly, the power grid decarbonisation is assumed to improve to either 50% or 80% over current rates, with 80% being the expected decarbonisation and 50% a more conservative estimate. Each possibility for EV adoption rate, ICE efficiency improvement, and power decarbonisation is combined (Hill et al. 2019). Beyond consuming less energy, EVs enable greater use of low-carbon and renewable energy sources than is possible for conventional petroleum-based fuels. These technical advantages lead to the potential for greatly reducing petroleum use, air pollution and carbon emissions. International collaboration could better leverage existing efforts to promote zero-emission vehicles. The establishment of a zero-emission vehicle deployment target and an electric mobility target for 2035 would help in establishing a common long-term global electric-drive vision (Lutsey 2015)."

Eliminating standby power losses can avoid energy wasted for no useful service in many appliances and devices, which may reduce household electricity use by up to 10% (Roy et al. 2012). At the building level, smaller dwellings can reduce overall demand for lighting and space conditioning services, while smaller dwellings, shared housing, and building lifespan extension can all reduce the overall demand for carbon-intensive building materials such as concrete and steel (Material Economics 2018; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b; Pauliuk et al. 2021). Emerging strategies for materials efficiency, such as 3D printing to optimise the geometries and minimise the materials content of structural elements, may also play a key role if thermal performance and circularity can be improved (Mahadevan et al. 2020; Adaloudis and Bonnin Roca 2021).

wg3_ch05_5.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Opportunities for avoiding waste associated with the provision of services, or avoiding overprovision of or excess demand for services, exist across multiple service categories. ‘Avoid’ options are relevant in all end-use sectors, namely, teleworking and avoiding long-haul flights, adjusting dwelling size to household size, and avoiding short-lifespan products and food waste. Cities and built environments can play an additional role. For example, more compact designs and higher accessibility reduce travel demand and translate into lower average floor space and corresponding heating/cooling and lighting demand, and thus reductions of between 5% to 20% of GHG emissions of end-use sectors (Creutzig et al. 2021b). Avoidance of food loss and wastage – which equalled 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2010–2016 (Mbow et al. 2019), while millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition – is a prime example (Chapter 12). A key challenge in meeting global nutrition services is therefore to avoid food loss and waste while simultaneously raising nutrition levels to equitable standards globally. Literature results indicate that in developed economies, consumers are the largest source of food waste, and that behavioural changes such as meal planning, use of leftovers, and avoidance of over-preparation can be important service-oriented solutions (Gunders et al. 2017; Schanes et al. 2018), while improvements to expiration labels by regulators would reduce unnecessary disposal of unexpired items (Wilson et al. 2017) and improved preservation in supply chains would reduce spoilage (Duncan and Gulbahar 2019). Around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019 globally, 61% of which came from households, 26% from food service and 13% from retail."

Coupling food waste reductions with dietary shifts can further reduce energy, land, and resource demand in upstream food provision systems, leading to substantial GHG emissions benefits. The estimated technical potential for GHG emissions reductions associated with shifts to sustainable healthy diets is 0.5–8 GtCO2-eq ( high confidence) (Smith et al. 2013; Jarmul et al. 2020; Creutzig et al. 2021b) (Figure 5.7, Table 12.2). Current literature on health, diets, and emissions indicates that sustainable food systems providing healthy diets for all are within reach but require significant cross-sectoral action, including improved agricultural practices, dietary shifts among consumers, and food waste reductions in production, distribution, retail, and consumption (Erb et al. 2016; Muller et al. 2017; Graça et al. 2019; Willett and al. 2019) (Table 12.9)."

Deforestation is the second-largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, caused mainly by expanding forestry and agriculture, and in many cases this agricultural expansion is driven by trade demand for food. For example, across the tropics, cattle and oilseed products account for half the deforestation carbon emissions, embodied in international trade to China and Europe (Creutzig et al. 2019a; Pendrill et al. 2019).

Modelling based on a plethora of bottom-up insights and options reveals that a balanced portfolio of ASI policies brings global transport sector emissions in line with global warming of not more than 1.5°C (Gota et al. 2019). For example, telework may be a significant lever for avoiding road transport associated with daily commutes, achievable through digitalisation, but its savings depend heavily on the modes, distances, and types of office use avoided (Hook et al. 2020) and whether additional travel is induced due to greater available time (Mokhtarian 2002) or vehicle use by other household members (Kim et al. 2015; de Abreu e Silva and Melo 2018). More robustly, avoiding kilometres travelled through improved urban planning and smart logistical systems can lead to fuel, and, hence, emissions savings (Creutzig et al. 2015a; IEA 2016; IEA 2017a; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018), or through avoiding long-haul flights (IEA 2021). For example, reallocating road and parking space to exclusive public transit lanes, protected bike lanes and pedestrian priority streets can reduce vehicle kilometres travelled in urban areas (ITF 2021). At the vehicle level, lightweighting strategies (Fischedick et al. 2014) and avoiding inputs of carbon-intensive materials into vehicle manufacturing can also lead to significant emissions savings through improved fuel economy (Das et al. 2016; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b)."

A systematic review demonstrates that 26 of 39 studies identified suggest that teleworking reduces energy use, induced mainly by distance travelled, and only eight studies suggest that teleworking increases or has a neutral impact on energy use (Hook et al. 2020).

Technology adoption, particularly banning combustion and diesel engines and 100% EV targets (and other zero-carbon fuels, especially in freight) and efficient lightweight cars, can contribute to between 30% and 70% of GHG emissions reduction from land transport in 2050, with 50% as our central estimate (see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2 and Chapter 10, Sections 10.4 and 10.7), consistent with scenario modelling (Figure 10.27) and based on rapid reduction in the GHG emission footprint of vehicle production. These numbers are consistent with the end of fossil fuel-based new cars in 2035 in major economies and of 100% of vehicles being zero-emission vehicles in 2050. Other economies that display vehicles obtained on second hand markets may phase out fossil fuel cars only after 2050, hence limiting the overall mitigation potential of electric vehicles to well below 100% in 2050. Higher energy use and CO2-footprint in BEV production compared to ICE production are to be met with more rapid decarbonisation of the industry sector and by the reduced need for overall vehicle stock, due to socio-cultural and infrastructure measures.

It is useful to differentiate between conversion and processing steps ‘upstream’ of end users (mines, power plants, manufacturing facilities) and ‘downstream’, that is, those associated with end-users, including service levels, and direct well-being benefits for people (Kalt et al. 2019). Illustrative examples of such resource processing systems and associated conversion losses drawn from the literature are shown in Figure 5.9, in the form of resource processing cascades for energy (direct energy conversion efficiencies (Nakićenović et al. 1993; De Stercke 2014)), water use in food production systems (water use efficiency and embodied water losses in food delivery and consumption (Lundqvist et al. 2008; Sadras et al. 2011)), and materials (Ayres and Simonis 1994; Fischer-Kowalski et al. 2011), using the example of steel manufacturing, use and recycling at the global level (Allwood and Cullen 2012).

Using the example of mobility, where service levels are usually expressed by passenger-km, service delivery efficiency is thus a function of the fuel efficiency of the vehicle and its drivetrain (typically only about 20%–25% for internal combustion engines, but close to 100% for electric motors) plus how many passengers the vehicle actually transports (load factor, typically as low as 20–25%, i.e. one passenger per vehicle that could seat four to five), that is, an aggregate end-use efficiency of between 4–6% only. Aggregated energy end-use efficiencies at the global level are estimated as low as 20% (De Stercke 2014), 13% for steel (recovered post-use scrap) (Allwood and Cullen 2012), and some 70% for food (including distribution losses and food waste of some 30%) (Lundqvist et al. 2008)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"To harness additional gains in efficiency by shifting the focus in service delivery systems to the end user can translate into large upstream resource reductions. For each unit of improvement at the end-use point of the service delivery system (examples shown in Figure 5.9), primary resource inputs are reduced between a factor of 6 to 7 units (water, steel, energy) (TWI2050 2018). For example, reducing energy needs for final service delivery equivalent to 1 EJ, reduces primary energy needs by some 7 EJ. There is thus  high evidence and  high agreement  in the literature that the leverage effect for improvements in end-use service delivery efficiency through behavioural, technological, and market organisational innovations is very large, ranging from a factor 6 to 7 (resource cascades) to up to a factor 10 to 20 (exergy analysis), with the highest improvement potentials at the end-user and service provisioning levels (for systemic reviews see Nakićenović et al. (1996a), Grubler et al. (2012b), and Sousa et al. (2017)). Also, the literature shows  high agreement  that current conversion efficiencies are invariably low, particularly for those components at the end-use and service-delivery back end of service provisioning systems. It also suggests that efficiencies might actually be even lower than those revealed by direct input-output resource accounting, as discussed above (Figure 5.9). Illustrative exergy efficiencies of entire national or global service delivery systems range from 2.5% (USA (Ayres 1989)) to 5% (OECD average (Grubler et al. 2012b)) and 10% (global (Nakićenović et al., 1996)). Studies that adopt more restricted systems boundaries, either leaving out upstream resource processing/conversion or conversely end-use and service provision, show typical exergetic efficiencies between 15% (city of Geneva (Grubler et al. 2012a)) to below 25% (Japan, Italy, and Brazil, albeit with incomplete systems coverage that miss important conversion losses (Nakićenović et al. 1996b)). These findings are confirmed by more recent exergy efficiency studies that also include longitudinal time trend analysis (Cullen and Allwood 2010; Brockway et al. 2014; Serrenho et al. 2014; Brockway et al. 2015; Guevara et al. 2016). Figure 5.10 illustrates how energy demand reductions can be realised by improving the resource efficiency cascades shown in Figure 5.9."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Long-term mitigation scenarios play a crucial role in climate policy design in the near term, by illuminating transition pathways, interactions between supply-side and demand-side interventions, their timing, and the scales of required investments needed to achieve mitigation goals (Chapter 3). Historically, most long-term mitigation scenarios have taken technology-centric approaches with heavy reliance on supply-side solutions and the use of carbon dioxide removal, particularly in 1.5°C scenarios (Rogelj et al. 2018). Comparatively less attention has been paid to deep demand-side reductions incorporating socio-cultural change and the cascade effects (Section 5.3.2) associated with ASI strategies, primarily due to limited past representation of such service-oriented interventions in long-term integrated assessment models (IAMs) and energy systems models (ESMs) (Grubler et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019). There is ample evidence of savings from sector- or issue-specific bottom-up studies (Section 5.3.1.2). However, these savings typically get lost in the dominant narrative provided by IAMs and ESMs and in their aggregate-level evaluations of combinations of ASI and efficiency strategies. As a result, their interaction effects do not typically get equal focus alongside supply-side and carbon dioxide removal options (Samadi et al. 2017; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Van den Berg et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"In response to 1.5°C ambitions, and a growing desire to identify participatory pathways with less reliance on carbon dioxide removal which has high uncertainty, some recent IAM and ESM mitigation scenarios have explored the role of deep demand-side energy and resource use reduction potentials at global and regional levels. Table 5.2 summarises long-term scenarios that aimed to: minimise service-level energy and resource demand as a central mitigation tenet; specifically evaluate the role of behavioural change and ASI strategies; and/or achieve a carbon budget with limited or no carbon dioxide removal. From assessment of this emerging body of literature, several general observations arise and are presented below."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"First, socio-cultural changes within transition pathways can offer gigatonne-scale CO2 savings potential at the global level, and therefore represent a substantial overlooked strategy in traditional mitigation scenarios. Two lifestyle change scenarios conducted with the IMAGE IAM suggested that behaviour and cultural changes such as heating and cooling set-point adjustments, shorter showers, reduced appliance use, shifts to public transit, less meat-intensive diets, and improved recycling can deliver an additional 1.7 Gt and 3 GtCO2 savings in 2050, beyond the savings achieved in traditional technology-centric mitigation scenarios for the 2°C and 1.5°C ambitions, respectively (van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Van Vuuren et al. 2018). In its Sustainable Development Scenario, the IEA’s behavioural change and resource efficiency wedges deliver around 3 GtCO2-eq reduction in 2050, combined savings, roughly equivalent to those of solar PV that same year (IEA 2019a). In Europe, a Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) scenario evaluating combined lifestyle changes such as teleworking, travel avoidance, dietary shifts, food waste reductions, and recycling reduced cumulative EU 27 CO2 emissions 2011–2050 by up to 16% compared to an SSP2 baseline (van de Ven et al. 2018). Also in Europe, a multi-regional input-output analysis suggested that adoption of low-carbon consumption practices could reduce carbon footprints by 25%, or 1.4 Gt (Moran et al. 2020). A global transport scenario suggests that transport sector emissions can decline from business-as-usual 18 GtCO2-eq to 2 GtCO2-eq if ASI strategies are deployed (Gota et al. 2019), a value considerably below the estimates provided in IAM scenarios that have limited or no resolution in ASI strategies (Chapter 10)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The IEA’s Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario, in which behavioural changes lead to 1.7 GtCO2 savings in 2030, expresses the substantial mitigation opportunity in terms of low-carbon technology equivalencies: to achieve the same emissions reductions, the global share of EVs in the NZE would have to increase from 20% to 45% by 2030 or the number of installed heat pumps in homes would have to increase from 440 to 660 million by 2030 (IEA 2021)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In light of the limited number of mitigation scenarios that represent socio-behavioural changes explicitly, there is medium evidence in the literature that such changes can reduce emissions at regional and global levels, but  high agreement  within that literature that such changes hold up to gigatonne-scale CO2 emissions reduction potentials."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Second, pursuant to the ASI principle, deep demand reductions require parallel pursuit of behavioural change and advanced energy-efficient technology deployment; neither is sufficient on its own. The LED scenario (Figure 5.10) combines behavioural and technological change consistent with numerous ASI strategies that leverage digitalisation, sharing, and circular economy megatrends to deliver decent living standards while reducing global final energy demand in 2050 to 245 EJ (Grubler et al. 2018). This value is 40% lower than final energy demand in 2018 (IEA 2019a), and a lower 2050 outcome than other IAM/ESM scenarios with primarily technology-centric mitigation approaches (Teske et al. 2015; IEA 2017b). In the IEA’s B2DS scenario, Avoid/Shift in the transport sector accounts for around 2 GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2060, whereas parallel vehicle efficiency improvements increase the overall mitigation wedge to 5.5 GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2060 (IEA 2017b). Through a combination of behavioural change and energy-efficient technology adoption, the IEA’s NZE requires only 340 EJ of global final energy demand with universal energy access in 2050, which is among the lowest of IPCC net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Third, low demand scenarios can reduce both supply-side capacity additions and the need for carbon capture and removal technologies to reach emissions targets. Of the scenarios listed in Table 5.2, one (LED-MESSAGE) reaches 2050 emissions targets with no carbon capture or removal technologies (Grubler et al. 2018), whereas others report significant reductions in reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) compared to traditional technology-centric mitigation pathways (Liu et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), with the IEA’s NZE notably requiring the least carbon dioxide removal (1.8 Gt in 2050) and primary bioenergy (100 EJ in 2050) compared to IPCC net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Fourth, the costs of reaching mitigation targets may be lower when incorporating ASI strategies for deep energy and resource demand reductions. The TIAM-Grantham low demand scenarios displayed reduction in mitigation costs (0.87–2.4% of GDP), while achieving even lower cumulative emissions to 2100 (228 to ~475 GtCO2) than its central demand scenario (741 to 1066 GtCO2), which had a cost range of (2.4–4.1% of GDP) (Napp et al. 2019). The GCAM behavioural change scenario concluded that domestic emission savings would contribute to reducing the costs of achieving the internationally agreed climate goal of the EU by 13.5% to 30% (van de Ven et al. 2018). The AIMS lifestyle case indicated that mitigation costs, expressed as global GDP loss, would be 14% lower than the SSP2 reference scenario in 2100, for both 2°C and 1.5°C mitigation targets (Liu et al. 2018). These findings mirror earlier AIM results, which indicated lower overall mitigation costs for scenarios focused on energy service demand reductions (Fujimori et al. 2014). In the IEA’s NZE, behavioural changes that avoid energy and resource demand save USD4 trillion (cumulatively 2021–2050) compared to if those emissions reductions were achieved through low‐carbon electricity and hydrogen deployment (IEA 2021)."

All are essentially emerging and contested concepts (Gallie 1955) that have the common goal of increasing convenience for users and rendering economic systems more resource efficient, but which exhibit variability in the literature on their definitions and system boundaries. Historically, both sharing and circular economies have been commonplace in developing countries, where reuse, repair, and waste scavenging and recycling comprise the core of informal economies facilitated by human interventions (Wilson et al. 2006; Asim et al. 2012; Pacheco et al. 2012). Digitalisation is now propelling sharing and circular economy concepts in developed and developing countries alike (Roy et al. 2021), and the three megatrends are highly interrelated, as seen in Figure 5.11. For example, many sharing economy concepts rely on corporate or, to lesser degree, non-profit digital platforms that enable efficient information and opportunity sharing, thus making it part of the digitalisation trend. Parts of the sharing economy are also included in some circular economy approaches, as shared resource use renders utilisation of material more efficient. Digital approaches to material management also support the circular economy, such as through waste exchanges and industrial symbiosis. Digitalisation aims more broadly to deliver services in more efficient, timely, intelligent, and less resource-intensive ways (i.e., by moving bits and not atoms), through the use of increasingly interconnected physical and digital systems in many facets of economies. With rising digitalisation also comes the risk of increased electricity use to power billions of devices and the internet infrastructure that connects them, as well as growing quantities of e-waste, presenting an important policy agenda for monitoring and balancing the carbon and resource costs and benefits of digitalisation (Malmodin and Lundén 2018; TWI2050 2019). Rebound effects and instigated consumption of digitalisation are risking to lead to a net increase in GHG emissions (Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018). The determinants and possible scales of mitigation potentials associated with each megatrend are discussed below."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In the context of service provision, there are numerous opportunities for consumers to buy, subscribe to, adopt, access, install or use digital goods and services (Wilson et al. 2020b). Digitalisation has opened up new possibilities across all domains of consumer activity, from travel and retail to domestic living and energy use. Digital platforms allow surplus resources to be identified, offered, shared, transacted and exchanged (Frenken 2017). Real-time information flows on consumers’ preferences and needs mean service provision can be personalised, differentiated, automated, and optimised (TWI2050 2019). Rapid innovation cycles and software upgrades drive continual improvements in performance and responsiveness to consumer behaviour. These characteristics of digitalisation enable new business models and services that affect both service demand, from shared ride-hailing (ITF 2017a) to smart heating (IEA 2017a), and how services are provisioned, from online farmers’ markets (Richards and Hamilton 2018) to peer-to-peer electricity trading to enable distributed power systems (Morstyn et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"In many cases, digitalisation provides a ‘radical functionality’ that enables users to do or accomplish something that they could not do before (Nagy et al. 2016). Indeed the consumer appeal of digital innovations varies widely, from choice, convenience, flexibility and control to relational and social benefits (Pettifor and Wilson 2020). Reviewing over 30 digital goods and services for mobility, food buying and domestic living, Wilson et al. (2020b) also found shared elements of appeal across multiple innovations including (i) making use of surplus, (ii) using not owning, (iii) being part of wider networks, and (iv) exerting greater control over service provisioning systems. Digitalisation thus creates a strong value proposition for certain consumer niches. Concurrent diffusion of many digital innovations amplifies their disruptive potential (Schuelke-Leech 2018; Wilson et al. 2019b). Besides basic mobile telephone service for communication, digital innovations have been primarily geared to population groups with high purchasing power, and too little to the needs of poor and vulnerable people."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The long-term sustainability implications of digitalised services hinge on four factors: (i) the direct energy demands of connected devices and the digital infrastructures (i.e., data centres and communication networks) that provide necessary computing, storage, and communication services (Section 9.4.6); (ii) the systems-level energy and resource efficiencies that may be gained through the provision of digital services (Wilson et al. 2020b); (iii) the resource, material, and waste management requirements of the billions of ICT devices that comprise the world’s digital systems (Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Malmodin and Lundén 2018) and (iv) the magnitude of potential rebound effects or induced energy demands that might unleash unintended and unsustainable demand growth, such as autonomous vehicles inducing more frequent and longer journeys due to reduced travel costs (Wadud et al. 2016). Estimating digitalisation’s direct energy demand has historically been hampered by lack of consistent global data on IT device stocks, their power consumption characteristics, and usage patterns, for both consumer devices and the data centres and communication networks behind them. As a result, quantitative estimates vary widely, with literature values suggesting that consumer devices, data centres, and data networks account for anywhere from 6% to 12% of global electricity use (Gelenbe and Caseau 2015; Cook et al. 2017; Malmodin and Lundén 2018). For example, within the literature on data centres, top-down models that project energy use on the basis of increasing demand for internet services tend to predict rapid global energy use growth, (Andrae and Edler 2015; Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Liu et al. 2020a), whereas bottom-up models that consider data centre technology stocks and their energy efficiency trends tend to predict slower but still positive growth (Shehabi et al. 2018; Hintemann and Hinterholzer 2019; Malmodin 2020; Masanet et al. 2020). Yet there is growing concern that remaining energy efficiency improvements might be outpaced by rising demand for digital services, particularly as data-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous vehicles promise to increase demand for data services even further in the future (TWI2050 2019; Masanet et al. 2020; Strubell et al. 2020). Rapid digitalisation is also contributing to an expanding e-waste problem, estimated to be the fastest growing domestic waste stream globally (Forti et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"As digitalisation proliferates, an important policy objective is therefore to invest in data collection and monitoring systems and energy demand models of digitalised systems to guide technology and policy investment decisions for addressing potential direct energy demand growth (IEA 2017a) and potentially concomitant growth in e-waste."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"However, the net systems-level energy and resource efficiencies gained through the provision of digital services could play an important role in dealing with climate change and other environmental challenges (Masanet and Matthews 2010; Melville 2010; Elliot 2011; Watson et al. 2012; Gholami et al. 2013; Añón Higón et al. 2017). As shown in Figure 5.12, assessments of numerous digital service opportunities for mobility, nutrition, shelter, and education and entertainment suggest that net emissions benefits can be delivered at the systems level, although these effects are highly context dependent. Importantly, evidence of potential negative outcomes due to rebound effects, induced demand, or life-cycle trade-offs can also be observed. For example, telework has been shown to reduce emissions where long and/or energy-intensive commutes are avoided, but can lead to net emissions increases in cases where greater non-work vehicle use occurs or only short, low-emissions commutes (e.g., via public transit) are avoided (Hook et al. 2020; IEA 2020a; Viana Cerqueira et al. 2020). Similarly, substitution of physical media by digital alternatives may lead to emissions increases where greater consumption is fuelled, whereas a shift to 3D printed structures may require more emissions-intensive concrete formulations or result in reduced thermal energy efficiency, leading to life-cycle emissions increases (Mahadevan et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Furthermore, digitalisation, automation and artificial intelligence, as general-purpose technologies, may lead to a plethora of new products and applications that are likely to be efficient on their own but that may also lead to undesirable changes or absolute increases in demand for products (Figure 5.12). For example, last-mile delivery in logistics is both expensive and cumbersome. Battery-powered drones enable a delivery of goods at similar lifecycle emissions to delivery vans (Stolaroff et al. 2018). At the same time, drone delivery is cheaper in terms of time (immediate delivery) and monetary costs (automation saves the highest-cost component: personnel) (Sudbury and Hutchinson 2016). As a result, demand for package delivery may increase rapidly. Similarly, automated vehicles reduce the costs of time, parking, and personnel, and therefore may dramatically increase vehicle mileage (Wadud et al. 2016; Cohen and Cavoli 2019). On-demand electric scooters offer mobility access preferable to passenger cars, but can replace trips otherwise taken on public transit (de Bortoli and Christoforou 2020) and can come with significant additional energy requirements for night-time system rebalancing (Hollingsworth et al. 2019; ITF 2020). The energy requirements of cryptocurrencies is also a growing concern, although considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the energy use of their underlying blockchain infrastructure (Vranken 2017; de Vries 2018; Stoll et al. 2019). For example, while it is clear that the energy requirements of global Bitcoin mining have grown significantly since 2017, recent literature indicates a wide range of estimates for 2020 (47 TWh to 125 TWh) due to data gaps and differences in modelling approaches (Lei et al. 2021). Initial estimates of the computational intensity of artificial intelligence algorithms suggest that energy requirements may be enormous without concerted effort to improve efficiencies, especially on the computational side (Strubell et al. 2020). Efficiency gains enabled by digitalisation, in terms of reduced GHG emissions or energy use per service unit, may be overcompensated by activity/scale effects."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Maximising the mitigation potential of digitalisation trends involves diligent monitoring and proactive management of both direct and indirect demand effects, to ensure that a proper balance is maintained. Direct energy demand can be managed through continued investments in, and incentives for, energy-efficient data centres, networks, and end-use devices (Masanet et al. 2011; Avgerinou et al. 2017; IEA 2017a; Koronen et al. 2020). Shifts to low-carbon power are a particularly important strategy being undertaken by data centre and network operators (Cook et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2020), which might be adopted across the digital device spectrum as a proactive mitigation strategy where data demands outpace hardware efficiency gains, which may be approaching limits in the near future (Koomey et al. 2011). Most recently, data centres are being investigated as a potential resource for demand response and load balancing in renewable power grids (Koronen et al. 2020; Zheng et al. 2020), while a large bandwidth for improving software efficiency has been suggested for overcoming slowing hardware efficiency gains (Leiserson et al. 2020). Ensuring efficiency benefits of digital services while avoiding potential rebound effects and demand surges will require early and proactive public policies to avoid excess energy use (TWI2050 2019; WBGU 2019), which will also necessitate investments in data collection and monitoring systems to ensure that net mitigation benefits are realised and that unintended consequences can be identified early and properly managed (IEA 2017a)."

However, the sharing economy offers the potential to shift from ‘asset-heavy’ ownership to ‘asset-light’ access, especially in developing countries (Retamal 2019). General conclusions on the sharing economy as a framework for climate change mitigation are challenging and are better broken down to specific subsystems (Mi and Coffman 2019) (Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I, 5.SM.4.3)."

wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The long-term sustainability implications of digitalised services hinge on four factors: (i) the direct energy demands of connected devices and the digital infrastructures (i.e., data centres and communication networks) that provide necessary computing, storage, and communication services (Section 9.4.6); (ii) the systems-level energy and resource efficiencies that may be gained through the provision of digital services (Wilson et al. 2020b); (iii) the resource, material, and waste management requirements of the billions of ICT devices that comprise the world’s digital systems (Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Malmodin and Lundén 2018) and (iv) the magnitude of potential rebound effects or induced energy demands that might unleash unintended and unsustainable demand growth, such as autonomous vehicles inducing more frequent and longer journeys due to reduced travel costs (Wadud et al. 2016). Estimating digitalisation’s direct energy demand has historically been hampered by lack of consistent global data on IT device stocks, their power consumption characteristics, and usage patterns, for both consumer devices and the data centres and communication networks behind them. As a result, quantitative estimates vary widely, with literature values suggesting that consumer devices, data centres, and data networks account for anywhere from 6% to 12% of global electricity use (Gelenbe and Caseau 2015; Cook et al. 2017; Malmodin and Lundén 2018). For example, within the literature on data centres, top-down models that project energy use on the basis of increasing demand for internet services tend to predict rapid global energy use growth, (Andrae and Edler 2015; Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Liu et al. 2020a), whereas bottom-up models that consider data centre technology stocks and their energy efficiency trends tend to predict slower but still positive growth (Shehabi et al. 2018; Hintemann and Hinterholzer 2019; Malmodin 2020; Masanet et al. 2020). Yet there is growing concern that remaining energy efficiency improvements might be outpaced by rising demand for digital services, particularly as data-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous vehicles promise to increase demand for data services even further in the future (TWI2050 2019; Masanet et al. 2020; Strubell et al. 2020). Rapid digitalisation is also contributing to an expanding e-waste problem, estimated to be the fastest growing domestic waste stream globally (Forti et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"As digitalisation proliferates, an important policy objective is therefore to invest in data collection and monitoring systems and energy demand models of digitalised systems to guide technology and policy investment decisions for addressing potential direct energy demand growth (IEA 2017a) and potentially concomitant growth in e-waste."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"However, the net systems-level energy and resource efficiencies gained through the provision of digital services could play an important role in dealing with climate change and other environmental challenges (Masanet and Matthews 2010; Melville 2010; Elliot 2011; Watson et al. 2012; Gholami et al. 2013; Añón Higón et al. 2017). As shown in Figure 5.12, assessments of numerous digital service opportunities for mobility, nutrition, shelter, and education and entertainment suggest that net emissions benefits can be delivered at the systems level, although these effects are highly context dependent. Importantly, evidence of potential negative outcomes due to rebound effects, induced demand, or life-cycle trade-offs can also be observed. For example, telework has been shown to reduce emissions where long and/or energy-intensive commutes are avoided, but can lead to net emissions increases in cases where greater non-work vehicle use occurs or only short, low-emissions commutes (e.g., via public transit) are avoided (Hook et al. 2020; IEA 2020a; Viana Cerqueira et al. 2020). Similarly, substitution of physical media by digital alternatives may lead to emissions increases where greater consumption is fuelled, whereas a shift to 3D printed structures may require more emissions-intensive concrete formulations or result in reduced thermal energy efficiency, leading to life-cycle emissions increases (Mahadevan et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Furthermore, digitalisation, automation and artificial intelligence, as general-purpose technologies, may lead to a plethora of new products and applications that are likely to be efficient on their own but that may also lead to undesirable changes or absolute increases in demand for products (Figure 5.12). For example, last-mile delivery in logistics is both expensive and cumbersome. Battery-powered drones enable a delivery of goods at similar lifecycle emissions to delivery vans (Stolaroff et al. 2018). At the same time, drone delivery is cheaper in terms of time (immediate delivery) and monetary costs (automation saves the highest-cost component: personnel) (Sudbury and Hutchinson 2016). As a result, demand for package delivery may increase rapidly. Similarly, automated vehicles reduce the costs of time, parking, and personnel, and therefore may dramatically increase vehicle mileage (Wadud et al. 2016; Cohen and Cavoli 2019). On-demand electric scooters offer mobility access preferable to passenger cars, but can replace trips otherwise taken on public transit (de Bortoli and Christoforou 2020) and can come with significant additional energy requirements for night-time system rebalancing (Hollingsworth et al. 2019; ITF 2020). The energy requirements of cryptocurrencies is also a growing concern, although considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the energy use of their underlying blockchain infrastructure (Vranken 2017; de Vries 2018; Stoll et al. 2019). For example, while it is clear that the energy requirements of global Bitcoin mining have grown significantly since 2017, recent literature indicates a wide range of estimates for 2020 (47 TWh to 125 TWh) due to data gaps and differences in modelling approaches (Lei et al. 2021). Initial estimates of the computational intensity of artificial intelligence algorithms suggest that energy requirements may be enormous without concerted effort to improve efficiencies, especially on the computational side (Strubell et al. 2020). Efficiency gains enabled by digitalisation, in terms of reduced GHG emissions or energy use per service unit, may be overcompensated by activity/scale effects."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Maximising the mitigation potential of digitalisation trends involves diligent monitoring and proactive management of both direct and indirect demand effects, to ensure that a proper balance is maintained. Direct energy demand can be managed through continued investments in, and incentives for, energy-efficient data centres, networks, and end-use devices (Masanet et al. 2011; Avgerinou et al. 2017; IEA 2017a; Koronen et al. 2020). Shifts to low-carbon power are a particularly important strategy being undertaken by data centre and network operators (Cook et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2020), which might be adopted across the digital device spectrum as a proactive mitigation strategy where data demands outpace hardware efficiency gains, which may be approaching limits in the near future (Koomey et al. 2011). Most recently, data centres are being investigated as a potential resource for demand response and load balancing in renewable power grids (Koronen et al. 2020; Zheng et al. 2020), while a large bandwidth for improving software efficiency has been suggested for overcoming slowing hardware efficiency gains (Leiserson et al. 2020). Ensuring efficiency benefits of digital services while avoiding potential rebound effects and demand surges will require early and proactive public policies to avoid excess energy use (TWI2050 2019; WBGU 2019), which will also necessitate investments in data collection and monitoring systems to ensure that net mitigation benefits are realised and that unintended consequences can be identified early and properly managed (IEA 2017a)."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Within a small but growing body of literature on the net effects of digitalisation, there is medium evidence that digitalised consumer services can reduce overall emissions, energy use, and activity levels, with medium agreement  on the scale of potential savings, with the important caveat that induced demand and rebound effects must be managed carefully to avoid negative outcomes."
wg3_ch05_5.3.4.2_p1,Shared mobility ,"Opportunities to increase service per product include peer-to-peer based sharing of goods and services such as housing, mobility, and tools. Hence, consumable products become durable goods delivering a ‘product service’, which potentially could provide the same level of service with fewer products (Fischedick et al. 2014).The sharing economy is an old practice of sharing assets between many without transferring ownership, which has been made new through focuses on sharing underutilised products and assets in ways that promote flexibility and convenience, often in a highly developed context via gig economy or online platforms. However, the sharing economy offers the potential to shift from ‘asset-heavy’ ownership to ‘asset-light’ access, especially in developing countries (Retamal 2019). General conclusions on the sharing economy as a framework for climate change mitigation are challenging and are better broken down to specific subsystems (Mi and Coffman 2019) (Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I, 5.SM.4.3)."
wg3_ch05_5.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Demand-side mitigation involves individuals (e.g., consumption choices), culture (e.g., social norms, values), corporate (e.g., investments), institutions (e.g., political agency), and infrastructure change ( high evidence, high agreement ). These five drivers of human behaviour either contribute to the status quo of a global high-carbon, consumption- and GDP growth-oriented economy or help generate the desired change to a low-carbon energy-services, well-being, and equity-oriented economy (Jackson 2016; Cassiers et al. 2018; Yuana et al. 2020; Nielsen et al. 2021) (Figure 5.14). Each driver has novel implications for the design and implementation of demand-side mitigation policies. They show important synergies, making energy demand mitigation a dynamic problem where the packaging and/or sequencing of different policies play a role in their effectiveness, demonstrated in Sections 5.5 and 5.6. The Social Science Primer (Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I) describes theory and empirical insights about the interplay between individual agency, the social and physical context of demand-side decisions in the form of social roles and norms, infrastructure and technological constraints and affordances, and other formal and informal institutions. Incremental interventions on all five fronts change social practices, affecting simultaneously energy and well-being (Schot and Kanger 2018). Transformative change will require coordinated use of all five drivers, as described in Figure 5.14 and, using novel insights about behaviour change for policy design and implementation ( high evidence,  high agreement ). In particular, socio-economic factors, such as equity, public service quality, electricity access and democracy are found to be highly significant in enabling need satisfaction at low energy use, whereas economic growth beyond moderate incomes and extractive economic activities are observed to be prohibiting factors (Vogel et al. 2021)."

Motivation for change for collective good comes from economic, legal, and social incentives, and regard for deeper intrinsic value of concern for others over extrinsic values. Capacity for change varies; people in informal settlements or rural areas are incapacitated by socio-political realities and have limited access to new energy-service options."
wg3_ch05_5.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Motivation and effort required for behaviour change increase from ‘Improve’ to ‘Shift’ to ‘Avoid’ decisions. ‘Improve’ requires changes in personal purchase decisions, ‘Shift’ involves changes in behavioural routines, ‘Avoid’ also involves changes in deeper values or mindsets. People set easy goals for themselves and more difficult ones for others (Attari et al. 2016) and underestimate the energy savings of behaviour changes that make a large difference (Attari et al. 2010). Most personal actions taken so far have small mitigation potential (recycling, ecodriving), and people refrain from options advocated more recently with high impact (less flying, living car free) (Dubois et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch05_5.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"As individuals pursue a broad set of goals and use calculation-, emotion-, and rule-based processes when they make energy decisions, demand-side policies can use a broad range of behavioural tools that complement subsidies, taxes, and regulations (Chakravarty and Roy 2016; Mattauch et al. 2016; Niamir 2019) ( high evidence, high agreement ). The provision of targeted information, social advertisements, and influence of trusted in-group members and/role models or admired role models like celebrities can be used to create better climate change knowledge and awareness (Niamir 2019; Niamir et al. 2020b; Niamir et al. 2020c). Behavioural interventions like communicating changes in social norms can accelerate behaviour change by creating tipping points (Nyborg et al. 2016). When changes in energy-demand decisions (such as switching to a plant-based diet, (Box 5.5)) are motivated by the creation and activation of a social identity consistent with this and other behaviours, positive spillover can accelerate behaviour change (Truelove et al. 2014), both within a domain or across settings, for example from work to home (Maki and Rothman 2017)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Meat eating is declining in the UK, alongside a shift from carbon-intensive red meat towards poultry. This is due to the interaction of behavioural, socio-cultural and organisational drivers (Vinnari and Vinnari 2014). Reduced meat consumption is primarily driven by issues of personal health and animal welfare, instead of climate or environment concerns (Latvala et al. 2012; Dibb and Fitzpatrick 2014; Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; Graça et al. 2019). Social movements have promoted shifts to a vegan diet (Morris et al. 2014; Laestadius et al. 2016) yet their impact on actual behaviour is the subject of debate (Taufik et al. 2019; Harguess et al. 2020; Sahakian et al. 2020). Companies have expanded new markets in non-meat products (MINTEL 2019). Both corporate food actors and new entrants offering more innovative ‘meat alternatives’ view consumer preferences as an economic opportunity, and are responding by increasing the availability of meat replacement products. No significant policy change has taken place in the UK to enable dietary shift (Wellesley and Froggatt 2015); however the Climate Change Committee has recommended dietary shift in the Sixth Carbon Budget (Climate Change Committee 2020), involving reduced consumption of high-carbon meat and dairy products by 20% by 2030, with further reductions in later years in order to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Agricultural policies serve to support meat production with large subsidies that lower production cost and effectively increase the meat intensity of diets at a population level (Simon 2003; Godfray et al. 2018). Deeper, population-wide reductions in meat consumption are hampered by these lock-in mechanisms which continue to stabilise the existing meat production-consumption system. The extent to which policymakers are willing to actively stimulate reduced meat consumption thus remains an open question (Godfray et al. 2018). See more in Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I, Section 5.SM.6.4."
wg3_ch05_box-5.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"People’s general perceptions of climate risks, first covered in AR5, motivate behaviour change; more proximate and personal feelings of being at risk triggered by extreme weather and climate-linked natural disasters will increase concern and willingness to act (Bergquist et al. 2019), though the window of increased support is short (Sisco et al. 2017). 67% of individuals in 26 countries see climate change as a major threat to their country, an increase from 53% in 2013, though 29% also consider it a minor or no threat (Fagan and Huang 2019). Concern that the COVID-19 crisis may derail this momentum due to a finite pool of worry (Weber 2006) appears to be unwarranted: Americans’ positions on climate change in 2020 matched high levels of concern measured in 2019 (Leiserowitz et al. 2020). Younger, female, and more educated individuals perceive climate risks to be larger (Weber 2016; Fagan and Huang 2019). Moral values and political ideology influence climate risk perception and beliefs about the outcomes and effectiveness of climate action (Maibach et al. 2011). Motivation for demand-side solutions can be increased by focusing on personal health or financial risks and benefits that clearly matter to people (Petrovic et al. 2014). Consistent with climate change as a normally distant, non-threatening, statistical issue (Gifford 2011; Fox-Glassman and Weber 2016 ), personal experience with climate-linked flooding or other extreme weather events increases perceptions of risk and willingness to act (Weber 2013; Atreya and Ferreira 2015; Sisco et al. 2017) when plausible mediators and moderators are considered Brügger et al. (2021), confirmed in all 24 countries studied by Broomell et al. (2015). Discounting the future matters (Hershfield et al. 2014): across multiple countries, individuals more focused on future outcomes are more likely to engage in environmental actions (Milfont et al. 2012)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is medium evidence and  high agreement  that demographics, values, goals, personal and social norms differentially determine ASI behaviours, in the Netherlands and Spain (Abrahamse and Steg 2009; Niamir 2019; Niamir et al. 2020b), the OECD (Ameli and Brandt 2015), and 11 European countries (Mills and Schleich 2012; Roy et al. 2012). Education and income increase ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ behaviour, whereas personal norms help to increase the more difficult ‘Avoid’ behaviours (Mills and Schleich 2012). Socio-demographic variables (household size and income) predict energy use, but psychological variables (perceived behavioural control, perceived responsibility) predict changes in energy use; younger households are more likely to adopt ‘Improve’ decisions, whereas education increases ‘Avoid’ decisions (Ahmad et al. 2015). In India and developing countries, ‘Avoid’ decisions are made by individuals championing a cause, while ‘Improve’ and ‘Shift’ behaviour are increased by awareness programmes and promotional materials highlighting environmental and financial benefits (Chakravarty and Roy 2016; Roy et al. 2018a). Cleaner cookstove adoption Box 5.6), a widely studied ‘Improve’ solution in developing countries (Nepal et al. 2010; Pant et al. 2014), goes up with income, education, and urban location.

wg3_ch05_box-5.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Universal access to clean and modern cooking energy could cut premature deaths from household air pollution by two-thirds, while reducing forest degradation and deforestation and contributinh to the reduction of up to 50% of CO2 emissions from cooking (relative to baseline by 2030) (IEA 2017c; Dagnachew et al. 2019). However, in the absence of policy reform and substantial energy investments, 2.3 billion people will have no access to clean cooking fuels such as biogas, LPG, natural gas or electricity in 2030 (IEA 2017c). Studies reveal that a combination of drivers influence adoption of new cookstove appliances, including affordability, behavioural and cultural aspects (lifestyles, social norms around cooking and dietary practices), information provision, availability, aesthetic qualities of the technology, perceived health benefits, and infrastructure (spatial design of households and cooking areas). The increasing efficiency improvements in electric cooking technologies could enable households to shift to electrical cooking at mass scale. The use of pressure cookers and rice cookers is now widespread in South Asia and beginning to penetrate the African market as consumer attitudes are changing towards household appliances with higher energy efficiencies (Batchelor et al. 2019). There are shifts towards electric and LPG stoves in Bhutan (Dendup and Arimura 2019), India (Pattanayak et al. 2019), Ecuador (Martínez et al. 2017; Gould et al. 2018) and Ethiopia (Tesfamichael et al. 2021); and improved biomass stoves in China (Smith et al. 1993). Significant subsidy, information (Dendup and Arimura 2019), social marketing and availability of technology in the local markets are some of the key policy instruments helping to adopt improved cookstoves (Pattanayak et al. 2019). There is no one-size-fits-all solution to household air pollution – different levels of shift and improvement occur in different cultural contexts, indicating the importance of socio-cultural and behavioural aspects in shifts in cooking practices.

People with altruistic and biospheric values are more likely to act on climate change and support climate policies than those with hedonic or egoistic values (Taylor et al. 2014), because these values are associated with higher awareness and concern about climate change, stronger belief that personal actions can help mitigate climate change, and stronger feelings of responsibility for taking climate action (Dietz 2014; Steg 2016). Research also suggest that egalitarian, individualistic, and hierarchical worldviews (Wildavsky and Dake 1990) have their role, and that successful solutions require policy-makers of all three worldviews to come together and communicate with each other (Chuang et al. 2020)."

Awareness, personal norms, and perceived behavioural control predict willingness to change energy-related behaviour above and beyond traditional socio-demographic and economic predictors (Schwartz 1977; Ajzen 1985; Stern 2000), as do perceptions of self-efficacy (Bostrom et al. 2019). However, such motivation for change is often not enough, as actors also need capacity for change and help to overcome individual, institutional and market barriers (Young et al. 2010; Bray et al. 2011; Carrington et al. 2014)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"Table 5.4 describes common obstacles to demand-side energy behaviour change, from loss aversion to present bias (for more detail see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I). Choice architecture refers to interventions (‘nudges’) that shape the choice context and how choices are presented, with seemingly-irrelevant details (e.g., option order or labels) often more important than option price (Thaler and Sunstein 2009). There is  high evidence and  high agreement  that choice architecture nudges shape energy decisions by capturing deciders’ attention; engaging their desire to contribute to the social good; facilitating accurate assessment of risks, costs, and benefits; and making complex information more accessible (Yoeli et al. 2017; Zangheri et al. 2019). Climate-friendly choice architecture includes the setting of proper defaults, the salient positioning of green options (in stores and online), forms of framing, and communication of social norms (Johnson et al. 2012). Simplifying access to greener options (and hence lowering effort) can promote ASI changes (Mani et al. 2013). Setting effective ‘green’ defaults may be the most effective policy to mainstream low-carbon energy choices (Sunstein and Reisch 2014), adopted in many contexts (Jachimowicz et al. 2019) and deemed acceptable in many countries (Sunstein et al. 2019). Table 5.3a lists how often different choice-architecture tools were used in many countries over the past 10 years to change ASI behaviours, and how often each tool was used to enhance an economic incentive. These tools have been tested mostly in developed countries. Reduction in energy use (typically electricity consumption) is the most widely studied behaviour (because metering is easily observable). All but one tool was applied to increase this ‘Avoid’ behaviour, with demand-side reductions from 0% to up to 20%, with most values below 3% (see also meta-analyses by Hummel and Maedche (2019); Nisa et al. (2019); van der Linden and Goldberg (2020); Stankuniene et al. (2020); and Khanna et al. (2021). Behavioural, economic, and legal instruments are most effective when applied as an internally consistent ensemble where they can reinforce each other, a concept referred to as ‘policy packaging’ in transport policy research (Givoni 2014). A meta-analysis, combining evidence of psychological and economic studies, demonstrates that feedback, monetary incentives and social comparison operate synergistically and are together more effective than the sum of individual interventions (Khanna et al. 2021). The same meta-analysis also shows that combined with monetary incentives, nudges and choice architecture can reduce global GHG emissions from household energy use by 5–6% (Khanna et al. 2021)."

Such critiques ignore the fact that there is no neutral way to present energy-use-related decisions, as every presentation format and choice environment influences choice, whether intentionally or not. Educating households and policy makers about the effectiveness of choice architecture and adding these behavioural tools to existing market- and regulation-based tools in a transparent and consultative way can provide desired outcomes with increased effectiveness, while avoiding charges of manipulation or deception. People consent to choice-architecture tools if their use is welfare-enhancing, policymakers are transparent about their goals and processes, public deliberation and participation are encouraged, and the choice architect is trusted (Sunstein et al. 2019)."

Social and cultural processes play an important role in shaping what actions people take on climate mitigation, interacting with individual, structural, institutional and economic drivers (Barr and Prillwitz 2014). Just like infrastructure, social and cultural processes can ‘lock in’ societies to carbon-intensive patterns of service delivery. They also offer potential levers to change normative ideas and social practices in order to achieve extensive emissions cuts ( high confidence) (Table 5.4)."
wg3_ch05_5.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"In terms of cultural processes, we can distinguish two levels of analysis: specific meanings associated with particular technologies or practices, and general narratives about climate change mitigation. Specific meanings (e.g., comfort, status, identity and agency) are associated with many technologies and everyday social practices that deliver energy services, from driving a car to using a cookstove ( high evidence,  high agreement ) (Section 5.5). Meanings are symbolic and influence the willingness of individuals to use existing technologies or shift to new ones (Wilhite and Ling 1995; Wilhite 2009; Sorrell 2015). Symbolic motives are more important predictors of technology adoption than instrumental motives (Steg 2005; Noppers et al. 2014; Noppers et al. 2015; Noppers et al. 2016) (see case study on app cabs in Kolkata, India (Box 5.8)). If an individual’s pro-environmental behaviour is associated with personal meaning than it also increases subjective well-being (Zawadzki et al. 2020). Status consciousness is highly relevant in GHG emission-intensive consumption choices (cars, houses). However, inversely framing energy-saving behaviour as high status is a promising strategy for emission reduction (Ramakrishnan and Creutzig 2021)."
wg3_ch05_5.4.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"At a broader level, narratives about climate mitigation circulate within and across societies, as recognised in SR1.5, and are broader than the meanings associated with specific technologies ( high evidence, high agreement ). Narratives enable people to imagine and make sense of the future through processes of interpretation, understanding, communication and social interaction (Smith et al. 2017). Stories about climate change are relevant for mitigation in numerous ways. They can be utopian or dystopian (e.g., The great derangement  by Amitav Ghosh) (Ghosh 2016), for example presenting apocalyptic stories and imagery to capture people’s attention and evoke emotional and behavioural response (O’Neill and Smith 2014). Reading climate stories has been shown to cause short-term influences on attitudes towards climate change, increasing the belief that climate change is human caused and increasing its issue priority (Schneider-Mayerson et al. 2020). Climate narratives can also be used to justify scepticism of science, drawing together coalitions of diverse actors into social movements that aim to prevent climate action (Lejano and Nero 2020). Narratives are also used in integrated assessment and energy system models that construct climate stabilisation scenarios, for example in the choice of parameters, their interpretation and model structure (Ellenbeck and Lilliestam 2019). One important narrative choice of many models involves framing climate change as market failure (which leads to the result that carbon pricing is required). While such a choice can be justified, other model framings can be equally justified (Ellenbeck and Lilliestam 2019)."

For example, narratives have been used by indigenous communities to imagine climate futures divergent from top-down, government-led narratives (Streeby 2018). The uptake of new climate narratives is influenced by political beliefs and trust. Policymakers can enable emissions reduction by employing narratives that have broad societal appeal, encourage behavioural change and complement regulatory and fiscal measures (Terzi 2020). Justice narratives may not have universal appeal: in a UK study, justice narratives polarised individuals along ideological lines, with lower support amongst individuals with right-wing beliefs; by contrast, narratives centred on saving energy, avoiding waste and patriotic values were more widely supported across society (Whitmarsh and Corner 2017). More research is needed to assess if these findings are prevalent in diverse socio-cultural contexts, as well as the role played by social media platforms to influence emerging narratives of climate change (Pearce et al. 2019)."

Research has shown that if there is low public trust in utility companies, service delivery by community-based non-profit organisations in the US (Stern et al. 1985) or public/private partnerships in Mexico (Friedmann and Sheinbaum 1998), offer more effective solutions, yet only if public trust is higher in these types of organisations. UK research shows that acceptance of shifts to less resource-intensive service provision (e.g., more resource-efficient products, extending product lifetimes, community schemes for sharing products) varies depending on factors including trust in suppliers and manufacturers, affordability, quality and hygiene of shared products, and fair allocation of responsibilities (Cherry et al. 2018). Trust  in other people plays an important role in the sharing economy (Li and Wang 2020), for example predicting shifts in transport mode, specifically car sharing involving rides with strangers (Acheampong and Siiba 2019) (Section 5.3.4.2)."

Changing social norms can encourage societal transformation and social tipping points to address climate mitigation (Nyborg et al. 2016; Otto et al. 2020). Providing feedback to people about how their own actions compare to others’ can encourage mitigation (Delmas et al. 2013), although the overall effect size is not strong (Abrahamse and Steg 2013). Trending norms are behaviours that are becoming more popular, even if currently practised by a minority. Communicating messages that the number of people engaging in a mitigation behaviour (e.g., giving a financial donation to an environmental conservation organisation) is increasing – a simple low-cost policy intervention – can encourage shifts to the targeted behaviour, even if the effect size is relatively small (Mortensen et al. 2019)."

Descriptive norms (perceptions of behaviours common in others) are more strongly related to mitigation actions when injunctive norms (perceptions of whether certain behaviours are commonly approved or disapproved) are also strong, when people are not strongly personally involved with mitigation topics (Göckeritz et al. 2010), when people are currently acting inconsistently with their preferences, when norm-based interventions are supported by other interventions and when the context supports norm-congruent actions (Miller and Prentice 2016). A descriptive norm prime (‘most other people try to reduce energy consumption’) together with injunctive norm feedback (‘you are very good at saving energy’) is a very effective combination to motivate further energy savings (Bonan et al. 2020). Second-order beliefs (perceptions of what others in the community believe) are particularly important for leveraging descriptive norms (Jachimowicz et al. 2018)."

But harnessing contagion can also mitigate warming. Carbon-heavy consumption patterns have become the norm only in part because we’re not charged for environmental damage we cause (Pigou 1920). The deeper source of these patterns has been peer influence (Frank 1999), because what we do influences others. A rooftop solar installation early in the adoption cycle, for example, spawns a copycat installation in the same neighbourhood within four months, on average. With such installations thus doubling every four months, a single new order results in 32 additional installations in just two years. And contagion doesn’t stop there, since each family also influences friends and relatives in distant locations."

If taxed more heavily, top earners would spend less, shifting the frames of reference that shape spending of those just below, and so on – each step simultaneously reducing emissions and liberating resources for additional green investment (Frank 2020). Many resist, believing that higher taxes would make it harder to buy life’s special extras. But that belief is a cognitive illusion (Frank 2020). Acquiring special things, which are inherently in short supply, requires outbidding others who also want them. When top tax rates rise in tandem, relative bidding power is completely unchanged, so the same penthouse apartments would end up in the same hands as before. More generally, behavioural contagion is important to leverage all relevant social tipping points for stabilising Earth’s climate (Otto et al. 2020)."

More just and acceptable implementation of renewable energy technologies requires taking account of the cultural meanings, emotional attachments and identities linked to particular landscapes and places where those technologies are proposed (Devine-Wright 2009) and enabling fairness in how decisions are taken and costs and benefits distributed (Wolsink 2007). This is important for achieving the goal of SDG 7 (increased use of renewable energy resources) in developing countries while achieving energy justice (Calzadilla and Mauger 2017). ‘Top-down’ imposition of climate policies by governments can translate into local opposition when perceived to be unjust and lacking transparency ( high evidence, high agreement ). Policymakers can build trust and increase the legitimacy of new policies by implementing early and extensive public and stakeholder participation, avoiding ‘Nimby’ (Not In My Back Yard) assumptions about objectors and adopting ‘Just Transition’ principles (Owens 2000; Wolsink 2007; Wüstenhagen et al. 2007; Dietz and Stern 2008; Devine-Wright 2011; Heffron and McCauley 2018).

Grassroots environmental initiatives, including community energy groups, are collective responses to, and critiques of, normative ways that everyday material needs (e.g., food, energy, making) are produced, supplied and circulated (Schlosberg and Coles 2016). Such initiatives can reconcile lower carbon footprints with higher life satisfaction and higher incomes (Vita et al. 2020). Local initiatives such as Transition Towns and community energy projects can lead to improvements in energy efficiency, ensure a decent standard of living and increase renewable energy uptake, while building on existing social trust, and, in turn, building social trust and initiating engagement, capacity building, and social capital formation (Hicks and Ison 2018). Another example are grassroot initiatives that aim to reduce food loss and waste, even as overall evidence on their effectiveness remains limited (Mariam et al. 2020). However, community energy initiatives are not always inclusive and require policy support for widespread implementation across all socio-economic groups (Aiken et al. 2017).

Civil society social movements frame grievances that resonate with society, mobilise resources to coordinate and sustain mass collective action, and operate within – and seek to influence – external conditions that enable or constrain political change (Caniglia et al. 2015).

Climate strikes have become internationally prevalent, for example the September 2019 strikes involved participants in more than 180 countries (Rosane 2019; Fisher and Nasrin 2020; Martiskainen et al. 2020). Enabled by digitalisation, these have given voice to youth on climate (Lee et al. 2020) and created a new cohort of active citizens engaged in climate demonstrations (Fisher 2019).

Religion can be an important cultural resource towards sustainability at individual, community and institutional levels (Ives and Kidwell 2019), providing leverage points for inner transformation towards sustainability (Woiwode et al. 2021). Normative interpretations of climate change for and from religious communities are found in nearly every geography, and often observe popular movements for climate action drawing on religious symbols or metaphors (Jenkins et al. 2018).

wg3_ch05_box-5.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"As an innovative technology, solar PV was strongly taken up by consumers (Nemet 2019). Several key factors explain its success. First, modular design made it applicable to different scales of deployment in different geographical contexts (e.g., large-scale grid-connected projects and smaller-scale off-grid projects) and allowed its application by companies taking advantage of emerging markets (Shum and Watanabe 2009). Second, culturally, solar PV symbolised an environmentally progressive technology that was valued by users (Morris and Jungjohann 2016). Large-scale adoption led to policy change (i.e., the introduction of feed-in tariffs that guaranteed a financial return) that in turn enabled improvements to the technology by companies. Over time, this has driven large-scale reductions in cost and increase in deployment worldwide. The relative importance of drivers varied across contexts. In Japan, state subsidies were lower yet did not hinder take-up because consumer behaviour was motivated by non-cost symbolic aspects. In Germany, policy change arose from social movements that campaigned for environmental conservation and opposed nuclear power, making solar PV policies politically acceptable. In summary, the seven-decade evolution of solar PV shows an evolution in which the agency of consumers has consistently played a key role in multiple countries, such that deriving 30–50% of global electricity supply from solar is now a realistic possibility (Creutzig et al. 2017).

Business models and strategies work both as a barrier to and an accelerator of decarbonisation. Still existing locked-in infrastructures and business models advantages fossil fuel industry over renewable and energy efficient end use industry (Klitkou et al. 2015). The fossil fuel energy generation and delivery system therefore epitomises a barrier to the acceptance and implementation of new and cleaner renewable energy technologies (Kariuki 2018). A good number of corporate agents have attempted to derail climate change mitigation by targeted lobbying and doubt-inducing media strategies (Oreskes and Conway 2011). A number of corporations that are involved in both upstream and downstream supply chains of fossil fuel companies make up the majority of organisations opposed to climate action (Dunlap and McCright 2015; Brulle 2019; Cory et al. 2021). Corporate advertisement and brand-building strategies also attempt to deflect corporate responsibility to individuals, and/or to appropriate climate care sentiments in their own brand building; climate change mitigation is uniquely framed through choice of products and consumption, avoiding the notion of the political collective action sphere (Doyle 2011; Doyle et al. 2019)."

The divestment movement adds additional pressure on fossil fuel related investments (Braungardt et al. 2019), even though fossil fuel financing remains resilient (Curran 2020).

Middle actors can bring about change in several different directions, be it, upstream, downstream or sideways. They can redefine professional ethics around sustainability issues, and, as influencers on the process of diffusion of innovations (Rogers 2003), professionals can enable or obstruct improvements in efficient service provision or shifts towards low-carbon technologies (e.g., air and ground source heat pumps, solar hot water, underfloor heating, programmable thermostats, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery) and mobility technologies (e.g., electric vehicles)."

Indeed, social provisioning contexts, including equity, democracy, public services and high quality infrastructure, are found to facilitate high levels of need satisfaction at lower energy use, whereas economic growth beyond moderate incomes and dependence on extractive industries inhibit it (Vogel et al. 2021). They shape and interact with technological systems (Unruh 2000; Foxon et al. 2004; Seto et al. 2014) and represent rules, norms and conventions that organise and structure actions (Vatn 2015) and help create new path dependency or strengthen existing path dependency (Mattioli et al. 2020) (see case studies in Boxes 5.5 to 5.8 and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I). These drive behaviour of actors through formal (e.g., laws, regulations, and standards) or informal (e.g., norms, habits, and customs) processes, and can create constraints on policy options (Breukers and Wolsink 2007 ). For example, the car-dependent transport system is maintained by interlocking elements and institutions, consisting of (i) the automotive industry; (ii) the provision of car infrastructure; (iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; (iv) the provision of public transport; (v) cultures of car consumption (Mattioli et al. 2020).

Policymakers have introduced multiple technological, behavioural and socio-cultural measures to tackle this challenge. New buses have been purchased by public authorities (Ghosh and Schot 2019). These have been promoted to middle class workers in terms of modernity, efficiency and comfort, and implemented using premium fares. Digitalisation and the sharing economy have encouraged take-up of shared taxi rides (‘app cabs’), being low cost and fast, but also influenced by levels of social trust involved in rides with strangers (Acheampong and Siiba 2019; Ghosh and Schot 2019). Rickshaws have been improved through use of LNG and cycling has been banned from busy roads. These measures contributed positively to halving greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP tin one decade within the Kolkata metropolitan area, with potential for further reduction (Colenbrander et al. 2016). However, social movements have opposed some changes due to concerns about social equity, since many of the new policies cater to middle class aspirations and preferences, at the cost of low-income and less privileged communities."

Change has unfolded in complex interactions between multiple actors, sustainability values and megatrends, where direct causalities are hard to identify. However, the prominence of policy actors as change agents is clear as they are changing multiple regimes from within. The state government initiated infrastructural change in public bus systems, coordinated with private and non-governmental actors such as auto-rickshaw operators and app cab owners, who hold crucial agency in offering public transport services in the city. The latter can directly be attributed to the global momentum of mobility-as-a-service platforms, at the intersection of digitalisation and sharing economy trends. More thoughtful action at a policy level is required to sustain and coordinate the diversity of public transport modes through infrastructure design and reflect on the overall direction of change (Roy et al. 2018b; Schot and Steinmueller 2018).

The design of a new electricity system to meet new emerging demand based on intermittent renewable sources can lead to a change in consumption habits and the adaption of lifestyles compliant with more power supply interruption (Maïzi et al. 2017; Maïzi and Mazauric 2019). The quality of the service delivery impacts directly the potential user uptake of low-carbon technologies among rural households. In the state of Himachal Pradesh in India, a shift from LPG to electricity among rural households, with induction stoves, has been successful due to the availability of stable and continuous electricity, which has been difficult to achieve in any other Indian state (Banerjee et al. 2016). In contrast, in South Africa, people who were using electricity earlier are now adopting LPG to diversify the energy source for cooking due to high electricity tariffs and frequent blackouts (Kimemia and Annegarn 2016) (Box 5.5 and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I)."

Specifically, there is a case for more investment in low-carbon transport infrastructure than assumed in environmental economics as it induces low-carbon preferences (Creutzig et al. 2016a; Mattauch et al. 2016; Mattauch et al. 2018). Changes in infrastructure provision for active travel may contribute to uptake of more walking and cycling (Frank et al. 2019). These effects contribute to higher uptake of low-carbon travel options, albeit the magnitude of effects depends on design choices and context (Goodman et al. 2013; Goodman et al. 2014; Song et al. 2017; Javaid et al. 2020; Abraham et al. 2021).

Demand-side transitions therefore do not happen easily and involve interacting processes and struggles on the behavioural, socio-cultural, institutional, business and technological dimensions (Nikas et al. 2020) (Section 5.4)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Transitions often take several decades, unfolding through several phases. Although there is variability across innovations, sectors, and countries, the transitions literature distinguishes four phases, characterised by generic core processes and challenges: (i) emergence, (ii) early adaptation, (i) diffusion, (iv) stabilisation ( high confidence) (Rotmans et al. 2001; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16). These four phases do not imply that transitions are linear, teleological processes, because set-backs or reversals may occur as a result of learning processes, conflicts, or changing coalitions (very high confidence) (Geels and Raven 2006; Messner 2015; Davidescu et al. 2018). There is also no guarantee that technological, social, or business model innovations progress beyond the first phase."
wg3_ch05_5.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"In the first phase, radical innovations emerge in peripheral niches, where researchers, inventors, social movement organisations or community activists dedicate time and effort to their development ( high confidence) (Kemp et al. 1998; Schot and Geels 2008). Radical social, technical and business model innovations are initially characterised by many uncertainties about technical performance, consumer interest, institutions and cultural meanings. Learning processes are therefore essential and can be stimulated through R&D, demonstration projects, local community initiatives or grassroots projects (Borghei and Magnusson 2016; Hossain 2016; Rosenbloom et al. 2018b; van Mierlo and Beers 2020). Typical challenges are fragmentation and high rates of project failure (den Hartog et al. 2018; Dana et al. 2021), limited funding (Auerswald and Branscomb 2003), limited consumer interest, and socio-cultural acceptance problems due to being perceived as strange or unfamiliar (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In the second phase, social or technical innovations are appropriated or purchased by early adopters, which increases visibility and may provide a small but steady flow of financial resources ( high evidence,  high agreement ) (Zimmerman and Zeitz 2002; Dewald and Truffer 2011). Learning processes, knowledge sharing and codification activities help stabilise the innovation, leading to best practice guidelines, standards, and formalised knowledge ( high evidence,  high agreement ) (Raven et al. 2008; Borghei and Magnusson 2018). User innovation may lead to the articulation of new routines and social practices, often in tandem with the integration of new technologies into people’s daily lives (Nielsen et al. 2016; Schot et al. 2016). Radical innovations remain confined to niches in the second phase because adoption is limited to small, dedicated groups (Schot et al. 2016), innovations are expensive or do not appeal to wider groups, or because complementary infrastructure are missing (Markard and Hoffmann 2016)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"In the third phase, radical innovations diffuse into wider communities and mainstream markets. Typical drivers are performance improvements, cost reductions, widespread consumer interest, investments in infrastructure and complementary technologies, institutional support and strong cultural appeal ( high evidence,  high agreement ) (Wilson 2012; Markard and Hoffmann 2016; Malone et al. 2017; Raven et al. 2017; Kanger et al. 2019). The latter may be related to wider cultural shifts such as increased public attention to climate change and new framings like ‘climate emergency’ which gained traction before the Covid-19 pandemic (Bouman et al. 2020b). These concerns may not last, however, since public attention typically follows cycles (Downs 1972; Djerf-Pierre 2012)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"This phase often involves multiple struggles: economic competition between low-carbon innovations and existing technologies and practices, business struggles between incumbents and new entrants (Hockerts and Wüstenhagen 2010), cultural and framing struggles in public opinion arenas (Kammermann and Dermont 2018; Rosenbloom 2018; Hess 2019a), and political struggles over adjustments in policies and institutions, which shape markets and innovations (Meadowcroft 2011; Roberts and Geels 2019). The lock-in mechanisms of existing practices and systems tend to weaken in the third phase, either because competing innovations erode their economic viability, cultural legitimacy or institutional support (Turnheim and Geels 2012; Roberts 2017; Kuokkanen et al. 2018; Leipprand and Flachsland 2018) or because exogenous shocks and pressures disrupt the status quo (Kungl and Geels 2018; Simpson 2019)."

The new system becomes institutionalised and anchored in professional standards, technical capabilities, infrastructures, educational programmes, regulations and institutional logics, user habits, and views of normality, which create new lock-ins (Galaskiewicz 1985; Shove and Southerton 2000; Barnes et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ options vary with regard to the four transition phases. Incremental ‘Improve’ options, such as energy-efficient appliances or stand-alone insulation measures, are not transitions but upgrades of existing technologies. They have progressed furthest since they build on existing knowledge and do not require wider changes (Geels et al. 2018). Some radical ‘Improve’ options, which have a different technological knowledge base, are beginning to diffuse, moving from phase two to three in multiple countries. Examples are electric vehicles, light-emitting diodes (LED), or passive house designs (Franceschini and Alkemade 2016; Berkeley et al. 2017). Many ‘Shift’ and ‘Avoid/Reduce’ options like heat pumps, district heating, passive house designs, compact cities, less meat initiatives, flight and car use reduction have low momentum in most countries, and are mostly in the first phase of isolated initiatives and projects (Bergman 2013; Morris et al. 2014; Bows-Larkin 2015; Bush et al. 2016; Kivimaa and Martiskainen 2018; Hoolohan et al. 2018). Structural transitions in Dutch cities, Copenhagen, and more recently Paris, however, demonstrate that transitions towards low-carbon lifestyles, developed around cycling, are possible (Colville-Andersen 2018). Low-carbon demand-side transitions are often still in early phases ( high evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch05_5.5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Transitional change is usually slow in the first and second transition phases, because experimentation, social and technological learning, and stabilisation processes take a long time, often decades, and remain restricted to small niches ( high confidence) (Wilson 2012; Bento 2013; Bento et al. 2018b). Transitional change accelerates in the third phase, as radical innovations diffuse from initial niches into mainstream markets, propelled by the self-reinforcing mechanisms discussed above. The rate of adoption (diffusion) of new practices, processes, artefacts, and behaviours is determined by a wide range of factors at the macro- and micro-scales, which have been identified by several decades of diffusion research in multiple disciplines (Mansfield 1968; Martino et al.1978; Davis 1979; Mahajan et al. 1990; Ausubel 1991; Grubler 1991; Feder and Umali 1993; Bayus 1994; Comin and Hobijn 2003; Rogers 2003; Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004; Meade and Islam 2006; Peres et al. 2010)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Diffusion rates are determined by two broad categories of variables: those intrinsic to the technology, product or practice under consideration (typically performance, costs, benefits), and those intrinsic to the adoption environment (e.g., socio-economic and market characteristics)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Despite differences, the literature offers three robust conclusions on acceleration ( high evidence, high agreement ): First, size matters. Acceleration of transitions is more difficult for social, economic, or technological systems of larger size (in terms of number of users, financial investments, infrastructure, powerful industries) (Wilson 2009; Wilson 2012). Size also matters at the level of the systems component involved in a transition. Components with smaller unit-scale (‘granular’ and thus relatively cheap), such as light bulbs or household appliances, turn over much faster (often within a decade) than large-scale, capital-intensive lumpy technologies and infrastructures (such as transport systems) where rates of change typically involve several decades, even up to a century (Grubler 1991; Leibowicz 2018). Also, the creation of entirely new systems (diffusion) takes longer time than replacements of existing technologies or practices (substitution) (Grübler et al. 1999); and late adopters tend to adopt faster than early pioneers (Wilson 2012; Grubler 1996)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Arguments about scale in the energy system date back at least to the 1970s when Schumacher, Lovins and others argued the case for smaller-scale, distributed technologies (Schumacher 1974; Lovins 1976; Lovins 1979). In Small is ProfitableLovins and colleagues evidenced over 200 reasons why decentralised energy resources, from distributed generation to end-use efficiency, made good business sense in addition to their social, human-centred benefits (Lovins et al. 2003). More recent advances in digital, solar and energy storage technologies have renewed technical and economic arguments in favour of adopting decentralised approaches to decarbonisation (Cook et al. 2016; Jain et al. 2017; Lovins et al. 2018). Smaller-scale technologies from microprocessors to solar panels show dramatically faster cost and performance improvement trajectories than large-scale energy supply facilities (Trancik 2014; Sweerts et al. 2020, Creutzig et al. 2021) (Figure 5.15). Analysing the performance of over 80 energy technologies historically, Wilson et al. (2020a) found that smaller scale, more ‘granular’ technologies are empirically associated with faster diffusion, lower investment risk, faster learning, more opportunities to escape lock-in, more equitable access, more job creation, and higher social returns on innovation investment. These advantages of more granular technologies are consistent with accelerated low-carbon transformation (Wilson et al. 2020a)."
wg3_ch05_5.5.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Second, complexity matters, which is often related to unit scale (Ma et al. 2008). Acceleration is more difficult for options with higher degrees of complexity (e.g., carbon capture, transport and storage, or a hydrogen economy) representing higher technological and investment risks that can slow down change. Options with lower complexity are easier to accelerate because they involve less experimentation and debugging and require less adoption efforts and risk."
wg3_ch05_5.5.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Third, agency, structure and meaning can accelerate transitions. The creation and mobilisation of actor coalitions is widely seen as important for acceleration, especially if these involve actors with technical skills, financial resources and political capital (Kern and Rogge 2016; Hess 2019b; Roberts and Geels 2019). Changes in policies and institutions can also accelerate transitions, especially if these create stable and attractive financial incentives or introduce technology-forcing standards or regulations (Brand et al. 2013; Kester et al. 2018; Roberts et al. 2018). Changes in meanings and cultural norms can also accelerate transitions, especially when they affect consumer practices, enhance social acceptance, and create legitimacy for stronger policy support (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001; Rogers 2003; Buschmann and Oels 2019). Adoption of most advanced practices can support leapfrogging of polluting technologies (Box 5.9)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.9_p1,NO_TITLE,"The concept of leapfrogging emerged in development economics (Soete 1985), energy policy (Goldemberg 1991) and environmental regulation (Perkins 2003, which provides a first critical review of the concept), and refers to a development strategy that skips traditional and polluting development in favour of the most advanced concepts. For instance, in rural areas without telephone landlines or electricity access (cables), a direct shift to mobile telephony or distributed, locally-sourced energy systems is promoted, or economic development policies for pre-industrial economies forego the traditional initial emphasis on heavy industry industrialisation, instead focusing on services like finance or tourism. Often leapfrogging is enabled by learning and innovation externalities where improved knowledge and technologies become available for late adopters at low costs. The literature highlights many cases of successful leapfrogging but also highlights limitations (Watson and Sauter 2011); with example case studies for China (Gallagher 2006; Chen and Li-Hua 2011); Mexico (Gallagher and Zarsky 2007); and Japan and Korea (Cho et al. 1998). Increasingly the concept is being integrated into the literature of low-carbon development, including innovation and technology transfer policies (Pigato et al. 2020), highlighting in particular the importance of contextual factors of successful technology transfer and leapfrogging including: domestic absorptive capacity and technological capabilities (Cirera and Maloney 2017); human capital, skills, and relevant technical know-how (Nelson and Phelps 1966); the size of the market (Keller 2004); greater openness to trade (Sachs and Warner 1995; Keller 2004); geographical proximity to investors and financing (Comin et al. 2012); environmental regulatory proximity (Dechezleprêtre et al. 2015); and stronger protection of intellectual property rights (Dechezleprêtre et al. 2013; Dussaux et al. 2017). The existence of a technological potential for leapfrogging therefore needs to be considered within a wider context of social, institutional, and economic factors that influence whether leapfrogging potentials can be realised ( high evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch05_box-5.9_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are also some contentious topics in the debate on accelerated low-carbon transitions. First, while acceleration is desirable to mitigate climate change, there is a risk that accelerating change too much may short-cut crucial experimentation and social and technological learning in ‘formative phases’ (Bento 2013; Bento et al. 2018b) and potentially lead to a pre-mature lock-in of solutions that later turn out to have negative impacts (Cowan 1990; Cowan 1991) ( high evidence, medium agreement )."
wg3_ch05_box-5.9_p3,NO_TITLE,"Second, there is an ongoing debate about the most powerful leverage points and policies for speeding up change in social and technological systems. Farmer et al. (2019) suggested ‘sensitive intervention points’ for low-carbon transitions, but do not quantify the impacts on transformations. Grubler et al. (2018) proposed an end-user and efficiency-focused strategy to achieve rapid emission reductions and quantified their scenario with a leading IAM. However, discussion of the policy implications of such a strategy have only just started (Wilson et al. 2019a), suggesting an important area for future research."
wg3_ch05_box-5.9_p4,NO_TITLE,"The last contentious issue is if policies can or should substitute for lack of economic or social appeal of change or for technological risks. Many large-scale supply-side climate mitigation options, such as CCS or nuclear power, involve high technological risks, critically depend on a stable carbon price, and are controversial in terms of social and environmental impacts (Sovacool et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016; Wilson et al. 2020a) ( high evidence, medium agreement ). There is continuing debate if and how policies could counterbalance these impacts in order to accelerate transitions (Nordhaus 2019; Lovins 2015). Some demand-side options like large-scale public transport infrastructures such as ‘Hyperloop’ (Decker et al. 2017) or concepts such as the Asian Super Grid (maglev fast train coupled with superconducting electricity transmission networks) (AIGC 2017) may face similar challenges, which adds weight and robustness to those demand-side options that are more decentralised, granular in scale, and provide potential tangible consumer benefits besides being low-carbon (like more efficient buildings and appliances, ‘soft’ urban mobility options (walking and cycling), digitalisation, among others (Grubler et al. 2018))."
wg3_ch05_box-5.9_p5,NO_TITLE,"A robust conclusion from this review is that there are no generic acceleration policies that are independent from the nature of what changes, by whom and how. Greater contextualisation and granularity in policy approaches is therefore important to address the challenges of rapid transitions towards zero-carbon systems ( high evidence,  high agreement )."
wg3_ch05_5.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In demand-side mitigation, governance is key to drive the multidimensional changes needed to meet service needs within a society that provide people with a decent living while increasingly reducing resource and energy input levels (Rojas-Rueda et al. 2012; Batchelor et al. 2018; OECD 2019a). Impartial governance, understood as equal treatment of everyone by the rule of law, creates social trust and is thus a key enabler of inclusive and participatory demand-side climate policies (Rothstein 2011). Inclusive and broad-based participation itself also leads to greater social trust and thus is also a key enabler of demand-side climate mitigation (Section 5.2). Higher social trust and inclusive participatory processes also reduce inequality, restrain opportunistic behaviour and enhance cooperation (Drews and van den Bergh 2016; Gür 2020) (Section 5.2). Altogether, broad-based participatory processes are central to the successful implementation of climate policies (Rothstein and Teorell 2008; Klenert et al. 2018) ( high evidence, medium agreement ). A culture of cooperation feeds back to increase social trust and enables action that reduce GHG emissions (Carattini et al. 2015; Jo and Carattini 2021), and requires including explicit consideration of the informal sector (Box 5.10). More equitable societies also have the institutional flexibility to allow for mitigation to advance faster, given their readiness to adopt locally-appropriate mitigation policies; they also suffer less from policy lock-in (Tanner et al. 2009; Lorenz 2013; Chu 2015; Cloutier et al. 2015; Martin 2016; Seto et al. 2016; Vandeweerdt et al. 2016; Turnheim et al. 2018)."

Due to its importance, policies which support informal-sector climate mitigation activities may be extremely efficient (Garland 2015). For example, environmental and energy taxes may have negative gross costs when the informal sector dominates economic activity since these taxes indirectly tax the informal sector; informal production may substitute for energy-intensive goods, with strong welfare-enhancing effects (Bento et al. 2018a). The informal sector can assemble social and financial capital, create jobs, and build low-carbon local economies (Ruzek 2015). Constraints on small and informal-sector firms’ ability to build climate resilience include financial and data barriers, limited access to information technology, and policy exclusion (Kraemer-Mbula and Wunsch-Vincent 2016; Crick et al. 2018a; Crick et al. 2018b)."

Community-based mapping, social learning, green infrastructure development, and participatory governance facilitate such information-sharing (Tauhid and Zawani 2018; Mazeka et al. 2019; Sharifi 2020), strengthening mitigation policies (Loiter and Norberg-Bohm 1999; Stokes and Warshaw 2017; Zhou et al. 2019)."

wg3_ch05_5.6.2_p1,‘Avoid’ Policies ,"There is high untapped potential of demand-side mitigation options if considered holistically within the domains of Avoid-Shift-Improve (Sections 5.3 and 5.4, Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3a,b). Within the demand-side mitigation options opportunity space, policies currently focus more on efficiency and ‘Improve’ options and relatively less on ‘Shift’ and ‘Avoid’ options (Dubois et al. 2019; Moberg et al. 2019). Current demand-side policies are fragmented, piecemeal and too weak to drive demand-side transitions commensurate with 1.5°C or 2°C climate goals (Wilson et al. 2012; Fawcett et al. 2019; Mundaca et al. 2019; Moberg et al. 2019) ( high evidence, highagreement ). However, increasingly policy mix in a number of countries has seen a rise in prohibitions on fossil fuel use as a way to weaken lock-ins, for example, on fossil fuel heating in favour of low-carbon alternatives (Rosenbloom et al. 2020). Policies that are aimed at behaviour and lifestyle changes carry a perception of political risks for policymakers, which may explain why policy instruments focus more on information provision and adoption of incentives than on regulation and investment (Rosenow et al. 2017; Moberg et al. 2019). Acceleration of demand-side transitions would thus require both a broadening of demand-side options and the creation of comprehensive and targeted policy mixes (Kern et al. 2017; Rosenow et al. 2017; IPCC 2018) that strengthen the five drivers of decision and action identified in Section 5.4, Table 5.4 and in Tables 5.5–5.7 ( high evidence, high agreement ). Demand-side transitions in developing and emerging economies would also require stronger administrative capacity as well as technical and financial support (UN-Habitat 2013; Creutzig et al. 2016b)."
wg3_ch05_5.6.2_p2,‘Avoid’ Policies ,Systematic categorisation of demand-side policy options in different sectors and services through the Avoid-Shift-Improve framework enables identification of major entry points and possible associated social struggles to overcome for the policy instruments/interventions as discussed below.
wg3_ch05_5.6.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is  high evidence and  highagreement  that ‘Avoid’ policies that affect lifestyle changes offer opportunities for cost-effective reductions in energy use and emissions, but would need to overcome political sensitivities around government efforts to shape and modify individual-level behaviour (Rosenow et al. 2017; Grubb et al. 2020) (Table 5.5). These policies include ways to help avoid travel growth through integrated city planning or building retrofits to help avoid demand for transport, heating or cooling (Bakker et al. 2014; Lucon et al. 2014; de Feijter et al. 2019), which interact with existing infrastructure. Dense pedestrianised cities and towns and medium-density transit corridors are better placed to implement policies for car reductions than ‘sprawled’ cities characterised by low-density, auto-dependent and separated land uses (Seto et al. 2014; Newman and Kenworthy 2015; Newman et al. 2017; Bakker et al. 2014)."

Infrastructure development costs less than for car dependent cities. However, it requires a mindset shift for urban and transport planners (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch05_5.6.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Policies that support the avoidance of higher-emission lifestyles and improve well-being are facilitated by the introduction of smart technologies, infrastructures and practices (Amini et al. 2019). They include regulations and measures for investment in high-quality ICT infrastructure and regulations to restrict number plates, as well as company policy around flexible working conditions (Lachapelle et al. 2018; Shabanpour et al. 2018). Working-from-home arrangements may advantage certain segments of society such as male, older, higher-educated and highly-paid employees, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in the labour market (Lambert et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021). In the absence of distributive or other equity-based measures, the potential gains in terms of emissions reduction may therefore be counteracted by the cost of increasing inequality. This potential growth in inequality is likely to be more severe in poorer countries that will additionally suffer from a lack of international funding for achieving the SDGs ( high evidence, medium agreement ) (Barbier and Burgess 2020; UN 2020)."

Governments also play a direct role beyond nudging citizens with information about health and well-being.While the effectiveness of these policies on behaviour change overall may be limited (Pearson-Stuttard et al. 2017; Shangguan et al. 2019), there is some room for policy to influence actors upstream, such as industry and supermarkets, which may give rise to longer-term, structural change."

Congestion charges are often complemented by other measures, such as company subsidies for bicycles, to incentivise the shift to public mobility services. Attracting people to public transport requires sufficient spatial coverage of transport with adequate level of provision, and good quality service at affordable fares (Sims et al. 2014; Moberg et al. 2019) ( high evidence, high agreement ). Cities such as Bogota, Colombia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile, have seen rapid growth of cycling, resulting in a six-fold increase in cyclists (Pucher and Buehler 2017). Broadly, the history and type of city determines how quickly the transition to public modes of transport can be achieved. For example, cities in developed countries enjoy an advantage in that there is a network of high-quality public transport predating the advent of automobiles, whereas cities in less developed countries are latecomers to large-scale network infrastructure (UN-Habitat 2013; Gota et al. 2019)."

These policies include ways to help avoid travel growth through integrated city planning or building retrofits to help avoid demand for transport, heating or cooling (Bakker et al. 2014; Lucon et al. 2014; de Feijter et al. 2019), which interact with existing infrastructure. Dense pedestrianised cities and towns and medium-density transit corridors are better placed to implement policies for car reductions than ‘sprawled’ cities characterised by low-density, auto-dependent and separated land uses (Seto et al. 2014; Newman and Kenworthy 2015; Newman et al. 2017; Bakker et al. 2014)."

Working-from-home arrangements may advantage certain segments of society such as male, older, higher-educated and highly-paid employees, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in the labour market (Lambert et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021). In the absence of distributive or other equity-based measures, the potential gains in terms of emissions reduction may therefore be counteracted by the cost of increasing inequality.

Congestion charges are often complemented by other measures, such as company subsidies for bicycles, to incentivise the shift to public mobility services. Attracting people to public transport requires sufficient spatial coverage of transport with adequate level of provision, and good quality service at affordable fares (Sims et al. 2014; Moberg et al. 2019) ( high evidence, high agreement ). Cities such as Bogota, Colombia, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile, have seen rapid growth of cycling, resulting in a six-fold increase in cyclists (Pucher and Buehler 2017). Broadly, the history and type of city determines how quickly the transition to public modes of transport can be achieved. For example, cities in developed countries enjoy an advantage in that there is a network of high-quality public transport predating the advent of automobiles, whereas cities in less developed countries are latecomers to large-scale network infrastructure (UN-Habitat 2013; Gota et al. 2019)."

In the first phase, which is characterised by the emergence or introduction of radical innovations in small niches, policies focus on: (i) supporting R&D and demonstration projects to enable learning and capability developments, (ii) nurturing the building of networks and multi-stakeholder interactions, and (iii) providing future orientation through visions or targets (Brown et al. 2003; López-García et al. 2019; Roesler and Hassler 2019). In the second phase, the policy emphasis shifts towards upscaling of experiments, standardisation, cost reduction, and the creation of early market niches (Borghei and Magnusson 2018; Ruggiero et al. 2018). In the third and later phases, comprehensive policy mixes are used to stimulate mass adoption, infrastructure creation, social acceptance and business investment (Fichter and Clausen 2016; Geels et al. 2018; Strauch 2020). In the fourth phase, transitions can also be stimulated through policies that weaken or phase out existing regimes, such as removing inefficient subsidies (for cheap petrol or fuel oil) that encourage wasteful consumption, increasing taxes on carbon-intensive products and practices (Box 5.11), or substantially tightening regulations and standards (Kivimaa and Kern 2016; David 2017; Rogge and Johnstone 2017)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.11_p1,NO_TITLE,"Whether the public supports specific policy instruments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is determined by cultural and political world views (Cherry et al. 2017; Kotchen et al. 2017; Alberini et al. 2018) and national positions in international climate negotiations, with major implications for policy design. For example, policy proposals need to circumvent ‘solution aversion’: that is, individuals are more doubtful about the urgency of climate change mitigation if the proposed policy contradicts their political worldviews (Campbell and Kay 2014). While there are reasons to believe that carbon pricing is the most efficient way to reduce emissions, a recent literature – focusing on populations in Western Europe and North America and carbon taxes – documents that efficiency features alone is not what makes citizens like or dislike carbon pricing schemes (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017; Klenert et al. 2018)."

Further, citizens have fairness concerns about carbon pricing (Büchs and Schnepf 2013; Douenne and Fabre 2019; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019), even if higher carbon prices can be made progressive by suitable use of revenues (Rausch et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2015; Klenert and Mattauch 2016). There are also non-economic properties of policy instruments that matter for public support: Calling a carbon price a ‘CO2 levy’ alleviates solution aversion (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017). It may be that the word ‘tax’ evokes a feeling of distrust in government and fears of high costs, low benefits and distributional effects (Strand 2020). Trust in politicians is negatively correlated with higher carbon prices (Hammar and Jagers 2006; Rafaty 2018) and political campaigns for a carbon tax can lower public support for them (Anderson et al. 2019). Few developing countries have adopted carbon taxes, probably due to high costs, relatively low benefits, and distributional effects (Strand 2020)."
wg3_ch05_box-5.11_p3,NO_TITLE,"To address these realities regarding support for carbon pricing, some studies have examined whether specific uses of the revenue can increase public support for higher carbon prices (Carattini et al. 2017; Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019). Doubt about the environmental effectiveness of carbon pricing may be alleviated if revenue from carbon pricing is earmarked for specific uses (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017) and higher carbon prices may then be supported (Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019). This is especially the case for using the proceeds on ‘green investment’ in infrastructure or energy efficiency programmes (Kotchen et al. 2017). Further, returning the revenues to individuals in a salient manner may increase public support and alleviate fairness proposals, given sufficient information (Carattini et al. 2017; Klenert et al. 2018). Perceived fairness is one of the strongest predictors of policy support (Jagers et al. 2010; Whittle et al. 2019)."

For example, the amount of electricity required for cooking can overwhelm the grid which can lead to failure, causing end-users to shift back to traditional biomass or fossil fuels (Ateba et al. 2018; Israel-Akinbo et al. 2018); thus grid stability policies need to be undertaken in conjunction."

wg3_ch05_5.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Sequencing policies appropriately is a success factor for climate policy regimes ( high evidence,  high agreement ). In most situations policy measures require a preparatory phase that prepares the ground by lowering the costs of policies, communicating the costs and benefits to citizens, and building coalitions for policies, thus reducing political resistance (Meckling et al. 2017). This policy sequencing aims to incrementally relax or remove barriers over time to enable significant cumulative increases in policy stringency and create coalitions that support future policy development (Pahle et al. 2018). German policies on renewables began with funding for research, design and development (RD&D), then subsidies for demonstration projects during the 1970s and 1980s, and continued to larger-scale projects such as ‘Solar Roofs’ programmes in the 1990s, including scaled-up feed-in tariffs for solar power (Jacobsson and Lauber 2006). These policies led to industrial expansion in wind and solar energy systems, giving rise to powerful renewables interest coalitions that defend existing measures and lend political support for further action. Policy sequencing has also been deployed to introduce technology bans and strict performance standards with a view to eliminating emissions as the end goal, and may involve simultaneous support for low-carbon options while deliberately phasing out established technological regimes (Rogge and Johnstone 2017)."

Pricing may be regressive and perceived as additional costs by households and industry, making investments in green infrastructure politically unfeasible, as examples from France and Australia show (Copland 2019; Douenne and Fabre 2020). Reforms that would push up household energy expenses are often left aside for fear of how citizens, especially the poor, would react or cope with higher bills ( high evidence, medium agreement ) (Martinez and Viegas 2017; Tesfamichael et al. 2021). This makes it important to precede carbon pricing with investments in renewable energy and low-carbon transport modes (Biber et al. 2017; Tvinnereim and Mehling 2018), and especially support for developing countries by building up low-carbon energy and mobility infrastructures and technologies, thus reducing resistance to carbon pricing (Creutzig 2019).

Policy packages often emerge through interactions between different policy instruments as they operate in either complementary or contradictory ways, resulting from conflicting policy goals (Cunningham et al. 2013; Givoni et al. 2013). An example includes the acceleration in shift from traditional biomass to the adoption of modern cooking fuel for 80 million households in rural India over a very short period of four years (2016–2020), which employed a comprehensive policy package including financial incentives, infrastructural support and strengthening of the supply chain to induce households to shift towards a clean cooking fuel from the use of biomass (Kumar 2019). This was operationalised by creating a LPG supply chain by linking oil and gas companies with distributors to assure availability, and create infrastructure for local storage along with an improvement of the rural road network, especially in the rural context (Sankhyayan and Dasgupta 2019). State governments initiated separate policies to increase the distributorship of LPG in their states (Kumar et al. 2016). Similarly, policy actions for scaling up electric vehicles need to be well designed and coordinated where EV policy, transport policy and climate policy are used together, working on different decision points and different aspects of human behaviour (Barton and Schütte 2017). The coordination of the multiple policy actions enables co-evolution of multiple outcomes that involve shifting towards renewable energy production, improving access to charging infrastructure, carbon pricing and other GHG measures (Wolbertus et al. 2018)."

The winners include low-carbon innovators and entrepreneurs, while the potential losers include incumbents with vested interests in sustaining the status quo (Mundaca et al. 2018; Monasterolo and Raberto 2019). Low-carbon policy packages would benefit from looking beyond climate benefits to include non-climate benefits such as health benefits, fuel poverty reductions and environmental co-benefits (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014; Sovacool et al. 2020b). The uptake of decentralised energy services using solar PV in rural areas in developing countries is one such example where successful initiatives are linked to the convergence of multiple policies that include import tariffs, research incentives for R&D, job creation programmes, policies to widen health and education services, and strategies for increased safety for women and children (Kattumuri and Kruse 2019; Gebreslassie 2020)."
wg3_ch05_5.6.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"The energy-efficient lighting transition in Europe represents a good case of the formation of policy coalitions that led to the development of policy packages. As attention to energy efficiency in Europe increased in the 1990s, policymakers attempted to stimulate energy-saving lamp diffusion through voluntary measures. But policies stimulated only limited adoption. Consumers perceived compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) as giving ‘cold’ light, being unattractively shaped, taking too long to achieve full brightness, unsuitable for many fixtures, and unreliable (Wall and Crosbie 2009). Still, innovations by major CFL and LED multinationals continued. Increasing political attention to climate change and criticisms from environmental NGOs (e.g. WWF, Greenpeace) strengthened awareness about the inefficiency of incandescent light bulbs (ILBs), which led to negative socio-cultural framings that associated ILBs with energy waste (Franceschini and Alkemade 2016). The combined pressures from the lighting industry, NGOs and member states led the European Commission to introduce the 2009 ban of ILBs of more than 80W, progressing to lower-wattage bans in successive years. While the ILB ban initially mainly boosted CFL diffusion, it also stimulated LED uptake. LED prices decreased quickly by more than 85% between 2008 and 2012 (Sanderson and Simons 2014), because of scale economies, standardisation and commoditisation of LED chip technology, and improved manufacturing techniques. Because of further rapid developments to meet consumer tastes, LEDs came to be seen as the future of domestic lighting (Franceschini et al. 2018). Acknowledging these changing views, the 2016 and 2018 European bans on directional and non-directional halogen bulbs explicitly intended to further accelerate the LED transition and reduce energy consumption for residential lighting."

To this end, people play an important role in the delivery of demand-side mitigation options within which efficiency and ‘Improve’ options dominate. Policies that are aimed at behaviour and lifestyle changes come with political risks for policymakers. However, the potential exists for broadening demand-side interventions to include ‘Avoid’ and ‘Shift’ policies. Longer term thinking and implementation that involves careful sequencing of policies as well as designing policy packages that address multiple co-benefits would be critical to manage interactions among supply-side and demand-side options to accelerate mitigation."

Discourses that portray plant-based protein as healthy and natural promote and stabilise particular diets. Novel narratives and inclusive processes help strategies to overcome multiple barriers.
