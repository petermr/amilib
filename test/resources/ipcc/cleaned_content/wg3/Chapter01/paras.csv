wg3_ch01_executive-summary_p1,NO_TITLE,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continued to rise to 2019: the aggregate reductions implied by current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to 2030 would still make it impossible to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and would only be compatible withlikely limiting warmingbelow 2°C if followed by much steeper decline, hence limiting warming to either level implies accelerated mitigation actions at all scales (robust evidence, high agreement).  Since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), important changes that have emerged include the specific objectives established in the Paris Agreement of 2015 (for temperature, adaptation and finance), rising climate impacts, and higher levels of societal awareness and support for climate action. The growth of global GHG emissions has slowed over the past decade, and delivering the updated NDCs to 2030 would turn this into decline, but the implied global emissions by 2030 exceed pathways consistent with 1.5°C by a large margin, and are near the upper end of the range of modelled pathways which keep temperatures likely  limit warming to 2°C (with >65% probability). Continuing investments in carbon-intensive activities at scale will heighten the multitude of risks associated with climate change and impede societal and industrial transformation towards low-carbon development. Meeting the long-term temperature objective  in the Paris Agreement therefore implies a rapid turn to an accelerating decline of GHG emissions towards ‘net zero’, which is implausible without urgent and ambitious action at all scales. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on the global economic and social system, and recovery will present both challenges and opportunities for climate mitigation. {1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, Chapters 3 and 4}"
wg3_ch01_executive-summary_p2,NO_TITLE,"While there are some trade-offs, effective and equitable climate policies are largely compatible with the broader goal of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty as enshrined in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (robust evidence, high agreement). Climate mitigation is one of many goals that societies pursue in the context of sustainable development, as evidenced by the wide range of the SDGs. Climate mitigation has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs. There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation. However, recent evidence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions. Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and capabilities. Given the differences in GHG emissions contributions, degree of vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep decarbonisation. Achieving sustainable global development and eradicating poverty as enshrined in the 17 SDGS would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale. Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability. International cooperation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development. {1.4, 1.6, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 17}"
wg3_ch01_executive-summary_p3,NO_TITLE,"The transition to a low-carbon economy depends on a wide range of closely intertwined drivers and constraints, including policies and technologies where notable advances over the past decade have opened up new and large-scale opportunities for deep decarbonisation, and for alternative development pathways which could deliver multiple social and developmental goals (robust evidence, medium agreement). Drivers for and constraints against low-carbon societal transition comprise economic and technological factors (the means by which services such as food, heating and shelter are provided and for whom, the emissions intensity of traded products, finance, and investment), socio-political issues (political economy, equity and fairness, social innovation and behaviour change), and institutional factors (legal framework and institutions, and the quality of international cooperation). In addition to being deeply intertwined all the factors matter to varying degrees, depending on the prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context. They often exert both push and pull forces at the same time, within and across different scales. The development  and deployment of innovative technologies and systems at scale are important for achieving deep decarbonisation. In recent years, the cost of several low-carbon technologies has declined sharply, alongside rapid deployment. Over 20 countries have also sustained emission reductions, and many more have accelerated energy efficiency and/or land-use improvements. Overall, however, the global contribution is so far modest, at a few billion tonnes (tCO2-eq) of avoided emissions annually. {1.3, 1.4, Chapters 2, 4, 13 and 14}"
wg3_ch01_executive-summary_p4,NO_TITLE,"Accelerating mitigation to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference within the climate system will require the integration of broadened assessment frameworks and tools that combine multiple perspectives, applied in a context of multi-level governance (robust evidence, medium agreement). Analysing a challenge on the scale of fully decarbonising our economies entails integration of multiple analytic frameworks. Approaches to risk assessment and resilience, established across IPCC Working Groups, are complemented by frameworks for probing the challenges in implementing mitigation. Aggregate frameworks include cost-effectiveness analysis towards given objectives, and cost-benefit analysis, both of which have been developing to take fuller account of advances in understanding risks and innovation, the dynamics of emitting systems and of climate impacts, and welfare economic theory including growing consensus on long-term discounting. Ethical frameworks consider the fairness of processes and outcomes which can help ameliorate distributional impacts across income groups, countries and generations. Transition and transformation frameworks explain and evaluate the dynamics of transitions to low-carbon systems arising from interactions amongst levels, with inevitable resistance from established socio-technical structures. Psychological, behavioural and political frameworks outline the constraints (and opportunities) arising from human psychology and the power of incumbent interests. A comprehensive understanding of climate mitigation must combine these multiple frameworks. Together with established risk frameworks, collectively these help to explain potential synergies and trade-offs in mitigation, imply a need for a wide portfolio of policies attuned to different actors and levels of decision-making, and underpin Just Transition strategies in diverse contexts. {1.2.2, 1.7, 1.8}"
wg3_ch01_executive-summary_p5,NO_TITLE,"The speed, direction and depth of any transition will be determined by choices in the, environmental, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional realms (robust evidence, high agreement)  . Transitions in specific systems can be gradual or rapid and disruptive. The pace of a transition can be impeded by ‘lock-in’ generated by existing physical capital, institutions, and social norms. The interaction between power, politics and economy is central in explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action. At the same time, attention to and support for climate policies and low-carbon societal transition has generally increased, as the impacts have become more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and balance of high- and low-carbon investments. COVID-19 has strained public finances, and integrating climate finance into ongoing recovery strategies, nationally and internationally, can accelerate the diffusion of low-carbon technologies and also help poorer countries to minimise future stranded assets. Societal and behavioural norms, regulations and institutions are essential conditions to accelerate low-carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major transition. {1.3.3, 1.4, 1.8, Chapters 2, 4 and 15, and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this chapter}"
wg3_ch01_executive-summary_p6,NO_TITLE,"Achieving the global transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable world requires purposeful and increasingly coordinated planning and decisions at many scales of governance including local, sub-national, national and global levels (robust evidence, high agreement). Accelerating mitigation globally would imply strengthening policies adopted to date, expanding the effort across options, sectors, and countries, and broadening responses to include more diverse actors and societal processes at multiple – including international – levels. Effective governance of climate change entails strong action across multiple jurisdictions and decision-making levels, including regular evaluation and learning. Choices that cause climate change as well as the processes for making and implementing relevant decisions involve a range of non-nation state actors such as cities, businesses, and civil society organisations. At global, national and sub-national levels, climate change actions are interwoven with and embedded in the context of much broader social, economic and political goals. Therefore, the governance required to address climate change has to navigate power, political, economic, and social dynamics at all levels of decision-making. Effective climate-governing institutions, and openness to experimentation on a variety of institutional arrangements, policies and programmes can play a vital role in engaging stakeholders and building momentum for effective climate action. {1.4, 1.9, Chapters 8, 15 and 17}"
wg3_ch01_1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This report (AR6 WGIII) aims to assess new literature on climate mitigation including implications for global sustainable development. In this Sixth Assessment Cycle the IPCChas also published three Special Reports, 1  all of which emphasise the rising threat of climate change and the implications for more ambitious mitigation efforts at all scales. At the same time, the Paris Agreement (PA) and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), both adopted in 2015, set out a globally agreed agenda within which climate mitigation efforts must be located. Along with a better understanding of the physical science basis of climate change (AR6 WGI), and vulnerabilities, impacts, and adaptation (AR6 WGII), the landscape of climate mitigation has evolved substantially since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."
wg3_ch01_1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since (IPCC 2014a), climate mitigation policies around the world have grown in both number and shape (Chapter 13). However, while the average rate of annual increase of CO2 emissions has declined (Section 1.3.2), GHG emissions globally continued to rise, underlining the urgency of the mitigation challenge (Chapters 2 and 3). Over 20 countries have cut absolute emissions alongside sustained economic growth, but the scale of mitigation action across countries remains varied and is generally much slower than the pace required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement (Sections 1.3.2 and 2.7.2). Per capita GHG emissions between countries even at similar stages of economic development (based on GDP per capita) vary by a factor of three (Figure 1.6) and by more than two on consumption basis (Section 2.3)."
wg3_ch01_1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) underlined that humanity is now living with the ‘unifying lens of the Anthropocene’ (IPCC 2018a, pp. 52–53), that requires a sharpened focus on the impact of human activity on the climate system and the planet more broadly given ‘planetary boundaries’ (Steffen et al. 2015) including interdependencies of climate change and biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021). Recent literature assessed by Working Groups I and II of this AR6 underlines the urgency of climate action as cumulative CO2 emissions, along with other greenhouses gases (GHGs), drives the temperature change. Across AR6, global temperature changes are defined relative to the period 1850–1900, as in SR1.5 and collaboration with WGI enabled the use of AR6-calibrated emulators to assure consistency across the three Working Groups. The remaining ‘carbon budgets’ (see Annex I: Glossary) associated with 1.5°C and 2°C temperature targets equate to about one (for 1.5°C) to three (for 2°C) decades of current emissions, as from 2020, but with significant variation depending on multiple factors including other gases (Figure 2.7, and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3). For an outline of the WGIII approach to mitigation scenarios, emission pathways implied by the Paris goals, and the timing of peak and ‘net zero’ (see Glossary and FAQ 1.3), see Section 1.5 and Chapter 3."
wg3_ch01_1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Strong differences remain in responsibilities for, and capabilities to, take climate action within and between countries. These differences, as well as differences in the impact of climate change, point to the role of collective action in achieving urgent and ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development, with attention to issues of equity and fairness as highlighted in several chapters of the report (Chapters 4, 5, 14, 15 and 17)."
wg3_ch01_1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Innovation and industrial development of key technologies in several relevant sectors have transformed prospects for mitigation at much lower cost than previously assessed (Chapters 2 and 6–12). Large reductions in the cost of widely available renewable energy technologies, along with energy efficient technologies and behavioural changes (Chapters 5 and 9–11), can enable societies to provide services with much lower emissions. However, there are still significant differences in the ability to access and utilise low-carbon technologies across the world (Chapters 4, 15 and 16). New actors, including cities, businesses, and numerous non-state transnational alliances have emerged as important players in the global effort to tackle climate change (Chapters 13–16)."
wg3_ch01_1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Along with continued development of concepts, models and technologies, there have been numerous insights from both the successes and failures of mitigation action that can inform future policy design and climate action.

wg3_ch01_1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"The greater the inertia in emission trends and carbon-intensive investments, the more that CO2 will continue to accumulate (Hilaire et al. 2019; IPCC 2019a). Overall, the literature points to the need for a more dynamic consideration of intertwined challenges concerning the transformation of key GHG-emitting systems: to minimise the trade-offs, and maximise the synergies, of delivering deep decarbonisation whilst enhancing sustainable development."
wg3_ch01_1.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"This chapter introduces readers to the AR6 WGIII Report and provides an overview of progress and challenges, in three parts. Part A (1.1–1.5) introduces the climate mitigation challenge, provides key findings and developments since previous assessment, and reviews the main drivers for, and constraints against accelerated climate action. Part B (1.6–1.8) provides an assessment of the key frameworks for understanding the climate mitigation challenge covering broad approaches such as sustainable development and more specific economic, political and ethical framings. Part C (1.9–1.12) briefly highlights the role of governance for steering and coordinating efforts to accelerate globally effective and equitable climate mitigation, notes the gaps in knowledge that have been identified in the process of assessment, and provides a road map to the rest of the report."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Successive WGIII IPCC assessments have emphasised the importance of climate mitigation along with the need to consider broader societal goals especially sustainable development. Key insights from AR5 and the subsequent three Special Reports (IPCC 2018b, 2019b, 2019c) are summarised below."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 projected that in baseline scenarios (i.e., based on prevailing trends without explicit additional mitigation efforts), agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) would be the only sector where emissions could fall by 2100, with some CO2 removal (IPCC 2014b, p. 17). Direct CO2 emissions from energy were projected to double or even triple by 2050 (IPCC 2014b, p. 20) due to global population and economic growth, resulting in global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared to pre-industrial levels. The AR5 noted that mitigation effort and the costs associated with ambitious mitigation differ significantly across countries, and in ‘globally cost-effective’ scenarios, the biggest reductions (relative to projections) occur in the countries with the highest future emissions in the baseline scenarios (IPCC 2014b, p. 17). Since most physical capital (e.g., power plants, buildings, transport infrastructure) involved in GHG emissions is long-lived, the timing of the shift in investments and strategies will be crucial (IPCC 2014b, p. 18)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"A key message from recent Special Reports is the urgency to mitigate GHG emissions in order to avoid rapid and potentially irreversible changes in natural and human systems (IPCC 2018b, 2019b, 2019c). Successive IPCC reports have drawn upon increasing sophistication of modelling tools to project emissions in the absence of ambitious decarbonisation action, as well as the emission pathways that meet long-term temperature targets. The SR1.5 examined pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C, compared to the historical baseline of 1850–1900, finding that ‘in pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050’ (2045–2055 interquartile range); with ‘overshoot’ referring to higher temperatures, then brought down by 2100 through ‘net negative’ emissions. It found this would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems ( high confidence) (IPCC 2018b)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The SR1.5 found that the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as declared under the Paris Agreement (PA) would not limit warming to 1.5°C; despite significant updates to NDCs in 2020/21, this remains the case, although delivery of these more ambitious NDCs would somewhat enhance the prospects for staying below 2°C (Section 1.3.3)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 WGIII and the Special Reports analysed economic costs associated with climate action. The estimates vary widely depending on the assumptions made as to how ordered the transition is, temperature target, technology availability, and the metric or model used, among others (Chapter 6). Modelled direct mitigation costs of pathways to 1.5°C, with no/limited overshoot, span a wide range, but were typically three to four times higher than in pathways to 2°C ( high confidence), before taking account of benefits, including significant reduction in loss of life and livelihoods, and avoided climate impacts (IPCC 2018b)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Successive IPCC reports highlight a strong connection between climate mitigation and sustainable development. Climate mitigation and adaptation goals have synergies and trade-offs with efforts to achieve sustainable development, including poverty eradication. A comprehensive assessment of climate policy therefore involves going beyond a narrow focus on specific mitigation and adaptation options to incorporate climate issues into the design of comprehensive strategies for equitable sustainable development. At the same time, some climate mitigation policies can run counter to sustainable development and eradicating poverty, which highlights the need to consider trade-offs alongside benefits. Examples include synergies between climate policy and improved air quality, reducing premature deaths and morbidity (IPCC 2014b, Figure SPM.6) (AR6 WGI Sections 6.6.3 and 6.7.3), but there would be trade-offs if policy raises net energy bills, with distributional implications. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) also emphasises important synergies and trade-offs, bringing new light on the link between healthy and sustainable food consumption and emissions caused by the agricultural sector. Land-related responses that contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation can also combat desertification and land degradation, and enhance food security (IPCC 2019a)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Previous Assessment Reports (ARs) have detailed the contribution of various sectors and activities to global GHG emissions. When indirect emissions (mainly from electricity, heat and other energy conversions) are included, the four main consumption (end-use) drivers are industry, AFOLU, buildings and transport (Figure 2.14), though the magnitude of these emissions can vary widely between countries. These – together with the energy and urban systems which feed and shape end-use sectors – define the sectoral chapters in this AR6 WGIII report."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Estimates of emissions associated with production and transport of internationally traded goods were first presented in AR5 WGIII, which estimated the ‘embodied emission transfers’ from upper-middle-income countries to industrialised countries through trade at about 10% of CO2 emissions in each of these groups (IPCC 2014a, Figure TS.5). The literature on this and discussion on their accounting has grown substantially since then (Chapters 2 and 8)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"The atmosphere is a shared global resource and an integral part of the ‘global commons’. In the depletion/restoration of this resource, myriad actors at various scales are involved, for instance, individuals, communities, firms and states. Inter alia, international cooperation to tackle ozone depletion and acid rain offer useful examples. The AR5 noted that greater cooperation would ensue if policies are perceived as fair and equitable by all countries along the spectrum of economic development – implying a need for equitable sharing of the effort. A key takeaway from AR5 is that climate policy involves value judgement and ethics. (IPCC 2014a Box TS.1: ‘People and countries have rights and owe duties towards each other. These are matters of justice, equity, or fairness. They fall within the subject matter of moral and political philosophy, jurisprudence, and economics.’ p. 37). International cooperation and collective action on climate change alongside local, national, regional and global policies will be crucial to solve the problem, and this report notes cooperative approaches beyond simple ‘global commons’ framings (Chapters 13 and 14)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 (all Working Group reports) also underlined that climate policy inherently involves risk and uncertainty (in nature, economy, society and individuals). To help evaluate responses, there exists a rich suite of analytical tools, for example, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria analysis, expected utility theory, and catastrophe and risk models. All have pros and cons, and have been further developed in subsequent literature and in AR6 (Sections 1.2.2 and 1.7)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"Recent assessments (IPCC 2014a, 2018b) began to consider the role of individual behavioural choices and cultural norms in driving energy and food patterns. Notably, SR1.5 (Section 4.4.3) outlined emerging evidence on the potential for changes in behaviour, lifestyle and culture to contribute to decarbonisation (and lower the cost); for the first time, AR6 devotes a whole chapter (Chapter 5) to consider these and other underlying drivers of energy demand, food choices and social aspects."
wg3_ch01_1.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The assessment of the Physical Science Basis (IPCC AR6 WGI) documents sustained and widespread changes in the atmosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean, providing unequivocal evidence of a world that has warmed, associated with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations reaching levels not experienced in at least the last 2 million years. Aside from temperature, other clearly discernible, human-induced changes beyond natural variations include declines in Arctic Sea ice and glaciers, thawing of permafrost, and a strengthening of the global water cycle (AR6 WGI SPM A.2, B.3 and B.4). Oceanic changes include rising sea level, acidification, deoxygenation, and changing salinity (WGI SPM B.3). Over land, in recent decades, both frequency and severity have increased for hot extremes but decreased for cold extremes; intensification of heavy precipitation is observed in parallel with a decrease in available water in dry seasons, along with an increased occurrence of weather conditions that promote wildfires."

Against the background of ‘unequivocal’ (AR4) evidence of human-induced climate change, and the growing experience of direct impacts, the IPCC has sought to systematise a robust approach to risk and risk management."
wg3_ch01_1.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In AR6 the IPCC employs a common risk framing across all three working groups and provides guidance for more consistent and transparent usage (AR6 WGI Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1; AR6 WGII Section 1.4.1; IPCC risk guidance). AR6 defines risk as ‘the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems’ (Annex I), encompassing risks from both potential impacts of climate change and human responses to it (Reisinger et al. 2020). The risk framing includes steps for identifying, evaluating, and prioritising current and future risks; for understanding the interactions among different sources of risk; for distributing effort and equitable sharing of risks; for monitoring and adjusting actions over time while continuing to assess changing circumstances; and for communications among analysts, decision-makers, and the public."
wg3_ch01_1.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climatechange risk assessments face challenges including a tendency to mischaracterise risks and pay insufficient attention to the potential for surprises (Weitzman 2011; Aven and Renn 2015; Stoerk et al. 2018).

With deep uncertainty, risk management often aims to identify specific combinations of response actions and enabling institutions that increase the potential for favourable outcomes despite irreducible uncertainties (AR6 WGII Chapter 17 Cross-Chapter Box DEEP; also Marchau et al. (2019); Doukas and Nikas (2020))."
wg3_ch01_1.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Literature trying to quantify the cost of climate damages has continued to develop. Different methodologies systematically affect outcomes, with recent estimates based on empirical approaches – econometric measurements based on actual impacts – ‘categorically higher than estimates from other approaches’ (AR6 WGII, Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC in Chapter 16, and Section 16.6.2). This, along with other developments strengthen foundations for calculating a ‘social cost of carbon’. This informs a common metric for comparing different risks and estimating benefits compared to the costs of GHG reductions and other risk-reducing options (Section 1.7.1); emissions mitigation itself also involves multiple uncertainties, which alongside risks can also involve potential opportunities (Section 1.7.3)."
wg3_ch01_1.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Simultaneously, the literature increasingly emphasises the importance of multi-objective risk assessment and management (e.g., representative key risks in AR6 WGII Chapter 16), which may or may not correlate with any single estimate of economic value (AR6 WGII, Section 1.4.1; IPCC risk guidance). Given the deep uncertainties and risks, the goals established (notably in the Paris Agreement and SDGs) reflect negotiated outcomes informed by the scientific assessment of risks."

wg3_ch01_1.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,The Paris Agreement is predicated on encouraging progressively ambitious climate action from all countries on the basis of Nationally Determined Contributions (Clémençon 2016; Rajamani 2016). The NDC approach requires countries to set their own level of ambitions for climate change mitigation but within a collaborative and legally binding process to foster ambition towards the agreed goals (Bodansky 2016; Falkner 2016 a). The PA entered into force in November 2016 and as of February 2021 it already had 190 Parties (out of 197 Parties to the UNFCCC).

In keeping with the acknowledged context of global sustainable development and poverty eradication, and the corresponding aims of aligning finance and agreed differentiating principles as indicated above, ‘…the developed country parties are to assist developing country parties with financial resources’ (PA Art. 9). The Green Climate Fund (GCF), an operating entity of the UNFCCC Financial Mechanism to finance mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries (GCF 2020), was given an important role in serving the Agreement and supporting PA goals. The GCF gathered pledges worth USD10.3 billion, from developed and developing countries, regions, and one city (Paris) (Antimiani et al. 2017; Bowman and Minas 2019).

wg3_ch01_1.3.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"SDGs. In September 2015, the UN endorsed a universal agenda – ‘Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’. The agenda adopted 17 non-legally-binding SDGs and 169 targets to support people, peace, prosperity, partnerships and the planet. While climate change is explicitly listed as SDG 13, the pursuit of the implementation of the UNFCCC is relevant for a number of other goals including SDG 7 (clean energy for all), SDG 9 (sustainable industry), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) as well as those relating to life below water (SDG 14) and on land (SDG 15) (Biermann et al. 2017). Mitigation actions could have multiple synergies and trade-offs across the SDGs (Pradhan et al. 2017) (Chapter 17) and their net effects depend on the pace and magnitude of changes, the specific mitigation choices and the management of the transition. This suggests that mitigation must be pursued in the broader context of sustainable development as explained in Section 1.6."

The SR1.5 report estimated that 1.5°C pathways would require increased investment  of 0.5–1% of global GDP between now and 2050, which is up to 2.5% of global savings/investment over the period. For low- and middle-income countries, SDG-compatible infrastructure investments in the most relevant sectors are estimated to be around 4–5% of their GDP, and ‘infrastructure investment paths compatible with full decarbonisation in the second half of the century need not cost more than more-polluting alternatives’ (Rozenberg and Fay 2019)."

Important driving factors include population and GDP growth, as illustrated in panels (b) and (c) of Figure 1.1 respectively. The pause in emissions growth reflected the interplay of strong energy efficiency improvements and low-carbon technology deployment, butthese did not expand fast enough to offset the continued pressures for overall growth at global level (UNEP 2018a; IEA 2019a). However, since 2013/14, the decline in global emissions intensity (GHG/GDP) has accelerated somewhat, and global emissions growth has averaged slightly slower than population growth (Figure 1.1d), which if sustained would imply a peak of global CO2 (GHG) emissions per capita, at about 5 tCO2 per person (7 tCO2-eq per person) respectively."

After COVID-19 however, no country is in this state. Very low interest rates amplify opportunities for large-scale investments which could bring ‘economic multiplier’ benefits, especially if they help to build the industries and infrastructures for further clean growth (Hepburn et al. 2020). However, the capability to mobilise low-interest finance varies markedly across countries and large public debts – including bringing some developing countries close to default – undermine both the political appetite and feasibility of large-scale clean investments. In practice the current orientation of COVID-19 recovery packages is very varied, pointing to a very mixed picture about whether or not countries are exploiting this opportunity (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this chapter)."

Important lessons can be drawn from the pandemic to climate change including the value of forward-looking risk management, the role of scientific assessment, preparatory action and international process and institutions (Chapter 5 and Section 1.3). There had been long-standing warnings of pandemic risks and precursors – with both pandemic and climate risks being identified by social scientists as ‘uncomfortable knowledge’ or ‘unknown knowns’, which tend to be marginalised in practical policy  (Rayner 2012; Sarewitz 2020). This echoes long-standing climate literature on potential ‘high impact’ events, including those perceived as low probability  (Dietz 2011; Weitzman 2011). The costs of preparatory action, mainly in those countries that had suffered from earlier pandemics were negligible in comparison, suggesting the importance not just of knowledge but its effective communication and embodiment in society (Chapter 5). Klenert et al.  (2020)  offer five early lessons for climate policy, concerning: the cost of delay; the bias in human judgement; the inequality of impacts; the need for multiple forms of international cooperation; and finally, ‘transparency in value judgements at the science–policy interface’."
wg3_ch01_cross-chapter-box-1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Emissions and behavioural changes. Overall, global CO2FFI emissions declined by about 5.8% (5.1–6.3%) from 2019 to 2020, or about 2.2 (1.8–2.4) GtCO2 in total (Section 2.2.2). Analysis from previous economic crises suggest significant rebound in emissions without policy-induced structural shifts (Jaeger et al. 2020) (Section 2.2.2.1 and Figure 2.5). Initial projections suggest the COVID aftermath may reduce emissions by 4–5% over 2025–2030 (Shan and Et.al 2020; Reilly et al. 2021), below a ‘no-pandemic’ baseline. The long-term impacts on behaviour, technology and associated emissions remain to be seen, but may be particularly significant in transport – lockdowns reduced mobility-related emissions, alongside two major growth areas: electronic communications replacing many work and personal travel requirements (Chapter 10 and Section 4.4.3.4); and revitalised local active transport and e-micromobility (Earley and Newman 2021). Temporary ‘clear skies’ may also have raised awareness of the potential environment and health co-benefits of reduced fossil fuel use particularly in urban areas (Section 8.7), with evidence also indicating that air pollution itself amplified vulnerability to COVID-19 (Gudka et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020). The significant impacts on passenger aviation are projected to extend not just through behavioural changes, but also fleet changes from retiring older planes, and reduced new orders indicating expectations of reduced demand and associated GHG emissions until 2030 (Sections 5.1.2 and 10.5) (AR6 WGI Box 6.1 in Chapter 6).

wg3_ch01_cross-chapter-box-1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Fiscal, growth and inequality impacts. Aspects of the global and regional economic crises from COVID-19 may prevail much longer than the crisis itself, potentially compromising mitigation. M ost countries have undertaken unprecedented levels of short-term public expenditures. The International MonetaryFund (IMF) projects sovereign debt to GDP to have increased by 20% in advanced economies and 10% in emerging economies by the end of 2021 (IMF 2020). This is likely to slow economic growth, and may squeeze financial resources for mitigation and relevant investments for many years to come (Sections 15.2.3 and 15.6.3). COVID-19 further lowered interest rates which should facilitate low-carbon investment, but pandemic responses have increased sovereign debt across countries in all income bands (IMF 2021), and, particularly in some developing economies and regions, it has caused debt distress (Bulowet al. 2021), widening the gap in developing countries’ access to capital (Hourcadeet al. 2021b) (Section 15.6.3). After decades of global progress in reducing poverty, COVID-19 has pushed hundreds of millions of people below poverty thresholds and raises the spectre of intersecting health and climate crises that are devastating for the most vulnerable (Section 5.1.2 and Box 5.1). Like those of climate change, pandemic impacts fall heavily on disadvantaged groups, exacerbate the uneven distribution of future benefits, amplify existing inequities, and introduce new ones.

Stern and Valero  (2021)  argue that investment in low-carbon innovation and its diffusion, complemented by investments in sustainable infrastructure, are key to shaping environmentally sustainable and inclusive growth in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

A post-Keynesian model of wider ‘green recovery’ policies  (Pollitt et al. 2021)  finds a short-run benefit of around 3.5% GDP (compared to ‘no policy’), and even about 1% above a recovery boosted by cuts in consumption taxes, the latter benefit sustained through 2030 – outperforming an equivalent conventional stimulus package while reducing global CO2 emissions by 12%."

The large public spending on supporting or stimulating economies, exceeding USD12 trillion by October 2020, dwarfs clean-energy investment needs and hence could either help to solve the combined crises, or result in high-carbon lock-in  (Andrijevicet al. 2020). The short-term ‘bail outs’ to date do not foster climate-resilient long-term investments and have not been much linked to climate action,  (Sections 15.2.3 and 15.6.3): in the G20 counties, 40% of energy-related support spending went to the fossil fuel industry compared to 37% on low-carbon energy  (EPT 2020). Recovery packages are also at risk of being ‘colourless’ (Hepburn et al., 2020), though some countries and regions have prioritised green stimulus expenditures for example as part of a ‘Green New Deal’ (Rochedoet al. 2021) (Sections 13.9.6 and 15.6.3)."

The response to COVID-19 also reflects the relevance of combining multiple analytic frameworks spanning economic efficiency, ethics and equity, transformation dynamics, and psychological and political analyses (Section 1.7). As with climate impacts, not only has the global burden of disease been distributed unevenly, but capabilities to prevent and treat disease were asymmetrical and those in greatest vulnerability often had the least access to human, physical, and financial resources  (Ruger and Horton 2020). ‘Green’ versus ‘brown’ recovery has corresponding distributional consequences between these and ‘green’ producers, suggesting need for differentiated policies with international coordination  (Le Billonet al. 2021).

wg3_ch01_cross-chapter-box-1_p14,NO_TITLE,"Crises and opportunities: the wider context for mitigation and transformation. The impacts of COVID-19 have been devastating in many ways, in many countries, and may distract political and financial capacity away from efforts to mitigate climate change. Yet, studies of previous post-shock periods suggest that waves of innovation that are ready to emerge can be accelerated by crises, which may prompt new behaviours, weaken incumbent (‘meso-level’) systems, and prompt rapid reforms  (Roberts and Geels 2019a)   (Section 1.6.5). Lessons from the collective effort to ‘flatten the curve’ during the pandemic, illustrating aspects of science–society interactions for public health in many countries, may carry over to climate mitigation, and open new opportunities (Section 5.1.2). COVID-19 appears to have accelerated the emergence of renewable power, electromobility and digitalisation  (Newman 2020) (Sections 5.1.2, 6.3 and 10.2). Institutional change is often very slow but major economic dislocation can create significant opportunities for new ways of financing and enabling ‘leapfrogging’ investment to happen (Section 10.8). Given the unambiguous risks of climate change, and consequent stranded asset risks from new fossil fuel investments (Box 6.11), the most robust recoveries are likely to be those which emerge on lower carbon and resilient pathways  (Obergasselet al. 2021). Noting the critical global post-COVID-19 challenge as the double impact of heightened credit risk in developing countries, along with indebtedness in developed countries, Hourcadeet al.  (2021a)  estimate that a ‘multilateral’ sovereign guarantee structure to underwrite low-carbon investments could leverage projects up to 15 times its value, contributing to shifting development pathways consistent with the SDGs and Paris goals."

Senior figures across many religions  (Francis 2015; IFEES 2015) stressed the duty of humanity to protect future generations and the natural world, and warned about the inequities of climate change. Growing awareness of local environmental problems such as air pollution in Asia and Africa (Karlsson et al. 2020), and the threat to indigenous people’s rights and existence has also fuelled climate activism (Etchart 2017).

There is often a mismatch between concerns on climate change and people’s willingness to pay for mitigation. For example, whilst most Americans believe climate change is happening, 68% said in a survey they would oppose climate policies that added just USD10 per month to electricity bills (EPIC et al. 2019), and worry about energy costs can eclipse those about climate change elsewhere (Poortinga et al. 2018) (Chapter 13)."

Often one sees the factors exerting both push and pull forces at the same time in the same and across different scales. For example, finance and investments can serve as a barrier or an enabler to climate action (Battiston et al. 2021). Similarly, political economy factors can align in favour of ambitious climate action or act in ways that inhibit strong cooperation and low-carbon transition. The other key insight from the assessment of the system drivers and constraints undertaken below is that none of the factors or conditions by themselves is more or less important than the others. In addition to being deeply intertwined all the factors matter in different measures with each exacting more or less force depending on the prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context.

Urban areas account for most (45–87%) of the global carbon footprint (8.1) and the strong and positive correlation between urbanisation and incomes means higher consumption from urban lifestyles will continue driving direct and indirect GHG emissions. Cities provide a conduit to many of the services such as transportation, housing, water, food, medical care and recreation, and other services and urban carbon emissions are driven not only by population and income but also by the form and structure of urban areas (Sections 8.1 and 8.3–8.6).

They could potentially draw down atmospheric CO2 much faster than the Earth’s natural carbon cycle, and reduce reliance on biomass-based removal (Köberle 2019; Realmonte et al. 2019), but some present novel risks to the environment and DACCS is currently more expensive than most other forms of mitigation (Fuss et al. 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 12).

Climate change presents both risks and opportunities for the financial sector. The risks include physical risks related to the impacts of climate change itself; transition risks related to the exposure to policy, technology and behavioural changes in line with a low-carbon transition; and liability risks from litigation for climate-related damages (Box 15.2). These could potentially lead to stranded assets (the loss of economic value of existing assets before the end of their useful lifetimes (Bos and Gupta 2019) (Sections 6.7 and 15.6.3). Such risks continue to be underestimated by financial institutions (Section 15.6.1). The continuing expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and insufficient transparency on how these are valued raises concerns that systemic risk may be accumulating in the financial sector in relation to a potential low-carbon transition that may already be under way (Battiston et al. 2017) (Section 15.6.3). The Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD) recommendations on transparency aim to ensure that investors and companies consider climate change risks in their strategies and capital allocation (TCFD 2018). This is helping ‘investors to reassess core assumptions’ and may lead to ‘significant’ capital reallocation (Fink 2020). However, metrics and indicators of assets risk exposure are inadequate (Monasterolo 2017; Campiglio et al. 2018) and transparency alone is insufficient to drive the required asset reallocation in the absence of clear regulatory frameworks (Ameli et al. 2020; Chenet et al. 2021).

Future investment needs are greatest in emerging and developing economies (Section 15.5.2) which already face higher costs of capital, hindering capacity to finance a transition (Buhr et al. 2018; Ameli et al. 2020). Requisite North–South financial flows are impeded by both geographic and technological risk premiums (Iyer et al. 2015), and the COVID-19 pandemic has further compromised the ability of developing and emerging economies to finance development activities or attract additional climate finance from developed countries (Section 15.6.3, and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in this chapter). Climate-related investments in developing countries also suffer from structural barriers such as sovereign risk and exchange rate volatility (Farooquee and Shrimali 2016; Guzman et al. 2018) which affect not only climate-related investment but investment in general (Yamahaki et al. 2020) including in needed infrastructure development (Gray and Irwin 2003). A Green Climate Fund (GCF) report notes the paradox that USD14 trillion of negative-yielding debt in OECD countries might be expected to flow to much larger low-carbon, climate-resilient investment opportunities in developing countries, but ‘this is not happening’ (Hourcade et al. 2021b)."

Similarly, Steffen and Schmidt (2019) found that even within multilateral development banks, ‘public- and private-sector branches differ considerably’, with public-sector lending used mainly in non-renewable and hydropower projects.

Political economy approaches can be crudely divided into ‘economic approaches to politics’, and those used by other social scientists (Paterson and P‐Laberge 2018). The former shows how electoral concerns lead to weak treaties (Battaglini and Harstad 2016) and when policy negotiations cause status-quo biases and the use of inefficient policy instruments (Austen-Smith et al. 2019) or delays and excessive harmonisation (Harstad 2007). The latter emphasises the central role of structures of power and production, and a commitment to economic growth and capital accumulation in relation to climate action, given the historically central role of fossil fuels to economic development and the deep embedding of fossil energy in daily life (Newell and Paterson 2010; Huber 2012; Di Muzio 2015; Malm 2015)."

The effects of climate policy are key considerations in deciding the level of policy ambition and direction and strategies of states (Lo 2010; Alam et al. 2013; Ibikunle and Okereke 2014), regions (Goldthau and Sitter 2015), and business actors (Wittneben et al. 2012), and there is a widespread cultural assumption that continued fossil fuel use is central to this (Strambo and Espinosa 2020). Decarbonisation strategies are often centred around projects to develop new sources of economic activity: carbon markets creating new commodities (Newell and Paterson 2010); investment generated in new urban infrastructure (Whitehead 2013); and/or innovations in a range of new energy technologies (Fankhauser et al. 2013; Lachapelle et al. 2017; Meckling and Nahm 2018)."

Drawing upon wider networks (Brulle 2014), campaigns by oil and coal companies against climate action in the United States of America and Australia are perhaps the most well known and largely successful of these (Pearse 2017; Brulle et al. 2020; Mildenberger 2020; Stokes 2020), although similar dynamics have been demonstrated in Brazil and South Africa (Hochstetler 2020), Canada (Harrison 2018), and Norway and Germany (Fitzgerald et al. 2019), for example. In other contexts, resistance by incumbent companies is more subtle but nevertheless has weakened policy design on emissions trading systems (Rosembloom and Markard 2020), and limited the development of alternative-fuelled automobiles (Levy and Egan 2003; Wells and Nieuwenhuis 2012)."

These dynamics can arise from the vested interest of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (Wittneben et al. 2012; Polman 2015; Wright and Nyberg 2017), the alignment and coalitions of countries in climate negotiations (Gupta 2016; Okereke and Coventry 2016), and the patterns of opposition to or support for climate policy among citizens (Baker 2015; Swilling et al. 2016; Heffron and McCauley 2018; Ransan-Cooper et al. 2018; Turhan et al. 2019)."

Equity issues help explain why it has proved hard to reach more substantive global agreements, as it is hard to agree on a level of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation (or emissions) and how to distribute mitigation efforts among countries (Kverndokk 2018) for several reasons. First, an optimal trade-off between mitigation costs and damage costs of climate change depends on ethical considerations, and simulations from integrated assessment models using different ethical parameters producing different optimal mitigation paths (IPCC 2018b) (Section 3.6.1.2). Second, treaties that are considered unfair may be hard to implement (Klinsky et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017). Lessons from experimental economics show that people may not accept a distribution that is considered unfair, even if there is a cost of not accepting (Gampfer 2014). As equity issues are important for reaching deep decarbonisation, the transition towards sustainable development (Evans and Phelan 2016; Heffron and McCauley 2018; Okereke 2018) depends on taking equity seriously in climate policies and international negotiations (Okereke and Coventry 2016; Klinsky et al. 2017; Martinez et al. 2019)."

Low-income countries tend to be more dependent on primary industries (agriculture and fisheries, etc.) than richer countries, and their infrastructure may be less robust to tackle more severe weather conditions. Within a country, the burdens may not be equally distributed either, due to policy measures implemented and from differences in vulnerability and adaptive capacity following from e.g. income and wealth distribution, race and gender. For instance, unequal social structures can result in women being more vulnerable to the effects of climate change compared to men, especially in poor countries (Arora-Jonsson 2011; Jost et al. 2016; Rao et al. 2019). Costs of mitigation also differ across countries. Studies show there are large disparities of economic impacts of NDCs across regions, and also between relatively similar countries when it comes to the level of development, due to large differences in marginal abatement costs for the emission-reduction goal of NDCs (Fujimori et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2017; Akimoto et al. 2018; Evans & Gabbatiss 2019).

Policy plays a central role in in land-related systems (Chapter 7), urban development (Chapter 8), improving energy efficiency in buildings (Chapter 9) and transport/mobility (Chapter 10), and decarbonising industrial systems (Chapter 11)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p2,NO_TITLE,"Policy has been and will be central not only because GHG emissions are almost universally under-priced in market economies (Stern and Stiglitz 2017; World Bank 2019), and because of inadequate economic incentives to innovation (Jaffe et al. 2005), but also due to various delay mechanisms (Karlsson and Gilek 2020) and multiple sources of path-dependence and lock-in to existing systems (Section 1.8.2), including: ‘Infrastructure developments and long-lived products that lock societies into GHG-intensive emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change, reinforcing the importance of early action for ambitious mitigation (robust evidence,  high agreement ).’ (AR5 WGIII p.18)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p3,NO_TITLE,"Many hundreds of policies have been introduced explicitly to mitigate GHG emissions, improve energy efficiency or land use, or to foster low-carbon industries and innovation, with demonstrable impact. The role of policy to date has been most evident in energy efficiency (Sections 5.4 and 5.6) and electricity (Chapter 6). The IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy already found that: ‘Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies’ (IPCC 2011a, p. 24). Policy packages since then have driven rapid expansion in renewables capacity and cost reductions (e.g., through the German Energiewende), and emission reductions from electricity (most dramatically with the halving of CO2 emissions from the UK power sector, driven by multiple policy instruments and regulatory changes), as detailed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.7.5)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"Chapter 13 charts the international evolution of policies and many of the lessons drawn. Attributing the overall impact on emissions is complex, but an emerging literature of several hundred papers indicates impacts on multiple drivers of emissions. Collectively, policies are likely to have curtailed global emissions growth by several GtCO2-eq annually already by the mid-2010s (Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 14). This suggests initial evidence that policy has driven some decoupling (Figure 1.1d) and started to ‘bend the curve’ of global emissions, but more specific attribution to observed trends is not as yet possible. 6 "
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p5,NO_TITLE,"However, some policies (e.g., subsidies to fossil fuel production or consumption) increase emissions, whilst others (e.g., investment protection) may constrain efforts at mitigation. Also, wider economic and developmental policies have important direct and indirect impacts on emissions. Policy is thus both a driver and a constraint on mitigation."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p6,NO_TITLE,"Synergies and trade-offs arise partly because of the nexus of GHG emissions with other adverse impacts (e.g., local air pollution) and critical resources (e.g., water and food) (Conway et al. 2015; Andrews-Speed and Dalin 2017), which also imply interacting policy domains."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p7,NO_TITLE,"The literature shows increasing emphasis on policy packages, including those spanning the different levels of niche/behaviour; existing regimes governing markets and public actors; and strategic and landscape levels (Section 1.7.3). Chapters 13, 16 and 17 appraise policies for transformation in the context of sustainable development, indicating the importance of policy as a driver at multiple levels and across many actors, with potential for benefits as well as costs at many levels."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p8,NO_TITLE,"National-level legislation may be particularly important to the credibility and long-term stability of policy to reduce the risks, and hence cost, of finance (Chapters 13 and 15), and for encouraging private-sector innovation at scale (Chapter 16), for example, if it offers greater stability and mid-term predictability for carbon prices; Nash and Steurer (2019) find that seven national climate change acts in European countries all act as ‘living policy processes, though to varying extents’."
wg3_ch01_1.4.8_p9,NO_TITLE,"The importance of policy at multiple levels does not lessen the importance of international policy, for reasons including long-term stability, equity, and scope, but examples of effective implementation policy at international levels remain fewer and governance weaker (Chapter 14)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.9_p1,NO_TITLE,"Institutions are rules and norms held in common by social actors that guide, constrain and shape human interaction (IPCC 2018b). Institutions can be formal, such as laws and policies, or informal, such as norms and conventions. Institutions can both facilitate or constrain climate policymaking and implementation in multiple ways. Institutions set the economic incentives for action or inaction on climate change at national, regional and individual levels (Dorsch and Flachsland 2017; Sullivan 2017)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.9_p2,NO_TITLE,"Institutions entrench specific political decision-making processes, often empowering some interests over others, including powerful interest groups who have vested interests in maintaining the current high-carbon economic structures (Okereke and Russel 2010; Wilhite 2016; Engau et al. 2017); see also Section 1.4.6 and Chapter 13 on the sub-national and national governance challenges including coordination, mediating politics and strategy setting."
wg3_ch01_1.4.9_p3,NO_TITLE,"Some suggest that societal transformation towards a low-carbon future requires new politics that involves thinking in intergenerational time horizons, as well as new forms of partnerships between private and public actors (Westman and Broto 2018), and associated institutions and social innovations to increase involvement of non-state actors in climate governance (Fuhr et al. 2018). However literature is divided as to how much democratisation of climate politics, with greater emphasis on equity and community participation, would advance societal transformation in the face of climate change (Stehr 2005), or may actually hinder radical climate action in some circumstances (Povitkina 2018)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.9_p4,NO_TITLE,"Since 2016, the number of climate litigation cases has increased rapidly. The UN Environment Programme’s Global Climate Litigation Report: 2020 Status Review (UNEP 2020) noted that between March 2017 and 1 July 2020, the number of cases nearly doubled with at least 1550 climate cases filed in eight countries. Several important cases such as Urgenda Foundation vs The State of the Netherlands (‘Urgenda’) and Juliana et al. vs United States (‘Juliana’) have had ripple effects, inspiring other similar cases (Lin and Kysar 2020)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.9_p5,NO_TITLE,"Numerous international climate governance initiatives engage national and sub-national governments, NGOs and private corporations, constituting a ‘regime complex’ (Raustiala and Victor 2004; Keohane and Victor 2011 ). They may have longer-run and second-order effects if commitments are more precise and binding (Kahler 2017). However, without targets, incentives, defined baselines or monitoring, reporting, and verification, they are not likely to fill the ‘mitigation gap’ (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p1,NO_TITLE,"Tackling climate change is often mentioned as an important reason for strong international cooperation in the 21st century (Falkner 2016; Keohane and Victor 2016; Bodansky et al. 2017; Cramton et al. 2017b). Mitigation costs are borne by countries taking action, while the benefits of reduced climate change are not limited to them, being in economic terms ‘global and non-excludable’. Hence anthropogenic climate change is typically seen as a global commons problem (Falkner 2016; Wapner and Elver 2017). Moreover, the belief that mitigation will raise energy costs and may adversely affect competitiveness creates incentives for free riding, where states avoid taking their fair share of action (Barrett 2005; Keohane and Victor 2016). International cooperation has the potential to address these challenges through collective action (Tulkens 2019) and international institutions offer the opportunity for actors to engage in meaningful communication and exchange of ideas about potential solutions (Cole 2015). International cooperation is also vital for the creation and diffusion of norms and the framework for stabilising expectations among actors (Pettenger 2016)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p2,NO_TITLE,"Some key roles of the UNFCCC have been detailed by its former heads (Kinley et al. 2021). In addition to specific agreements (most recently the PA) it has enhanced transparency through reporting and data, and generated or reinforced several important norms for global climate action including the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, and the precautionary principles for maintaining global cooperation among states with unevenly distributed emissions sources, climate impacts, and varying mitigation costs across countries (Keohane and Victor, 2016). In addition to formal negotiations, the annual Conference of the Parties (COPs) have increased awareness, and motivated more ambitious actions, sometimes through the formation of ‘coalitions of the willing’, for example. It provides a structure for measuring and monitoring action towards a global goal (Milkoreit and Haapala 2019). International cooperation (including the UNFCCC) can also promote technology development and transfer and capacity building; mobilise finance for mitigation and adaptation; and help address concerns on climate justice (Okereke and Coventry 2016; Chan et al. 2018) (Chapters 14–16)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p3,NO_TITLE,"A common criticism of international institutions is their limited (if any) powers to enforce compliance (Zahar 2017). As a global legal institution, the PA has little enforcement mechanism (Sindico 2015), but enforcement is not a necessary condition for an instrument to be legally binding (Bodansky 2016; Rajamani 2016). In reality implementation of specific commitments tends to be high once countries have ratified and a treaty or an agreement is in force (Bodansky 2016; Rajamani 2016). Often, the problem is not so much of ‘power to enforce compliance or sanction non-compliance’, but the level of ambition (Chapter 14)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p4,NO_TITLE,"However, whilst in most respects a driver, international cooperation has also been characterised as ‘organised hypocrisy’ where proclamations are not matched with corresponding action (Egnell 2010). Various reasons for inadequate progress after 30 years of climate negotiations, have been identified (Stoddard et al. 2021). International cooperation can also seem to be a barrier to ambitious action when negotiation is trapped in ‘relative-gains’ calculus, in which countries seek to game the regime or gain leverage over one another (Purdon 2017), or where states lower ambition to the ‘least common dominator’ to accommodate participation of the least ambitious states (Falkner 2016). Geden (2016) and Dubash (2020) offer more nuanced assessments."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p5,NO_TITLE,"International collaboration works best if an agreement can be made self-reinforcing with incentives for mutual gains and joint action (Barrett 2016; Keohane and Victor 2016), but the structure of the climate challenge makes this hard to achieve. The evidence from the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances and from the Kyoto Protocol on GHGs, is that legally binding targets have been effective in that participating Parties complied with them (Shishlov et al. 2016; Albrecht and Parker 2019), and (for Kyoto) these account for most of the countries that have sustained emission reductions for at least the past 10 to 15 years (Sections 1.3.2 and 2.2). However, such binding commitments may deter participation if there are no clear incentives to sustain participation and especially if other growing emitters are omitted by design, as with the Kyoto Protocol. Consequently the USA refused to ratify (and Canada withdrew), particularly on the grounds that developing countries had no targets; with participation in Kyoto’s second period commitments declining further, the net result was limited global progress in emissions under Kyoto (Bodansky 2016; Okereke and Coventry 2016; Scavenius and Rayner 2018) despite full legal compliance in both commitment periods (Chapter 14)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p6,NO_TITLE,"The negotiation of the Paris Agreement was thus done in the context of serious questions about how best to structure international climate cooperation to achieve better results. This new agreement is designed to sidestep the fractious bargaining which characterised international climate cooperation (Marcu 2017). It contains a mix of hard, soft and non-obligations, the boundaries between which are blurred, but each of which plays a distinct and valuable role (Rajamani 2016). The provisions of the PA could encourage flexible responses to changing conditions, but limit assurances of ambitious national commitments and their fulfilment (Pickering et al. 2018). The extent to which this new arrangement will drive ambitious climate policy in the long run remains to be seen (Chapter 14)."
wg3_ch01_1.4.10_p7,NO_TITLE,"Whilst the PA abandoned common accounting systems and time frames, outside of the UNFCCC many other platforms and metrics for comparing mitigation efforts have emerged (Aldy 2015). Countries may assess others’ efforts in determining their actions through multiple platforms including the Climate Change Cooperation Index (C3-I), Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), Climate Laws, Institutions and Measures Index (CLIMI) (Bernauer and Böhmelt 2013) and Energy Transition Index (Singh et al. 2019). International cooperative initiatives between and among non-state (e.g., business, investors and civil society) and sub-national (e.g., city and state) actors have also been emerging, taking the forms of public-private partnerships, private-sector governance initiatives, NGO transnational initiatives, and sub-national transnational initiatives (Bulkeley and Schroeder 2012; Hsu et al. 2018). Literature is mostly positive about the role of these transnational initiatives in facilitating climate action across scales although criticism and caution about their accountability and effectiveness remain (Chan et al. 2016; Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017; Roger et al. 2017; Widerberg and Pattberg 2017) (Chapter 14)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Scenarios are a powerful tool for exploring an uncertain future world against the background of alternative choices and development. Scenarios can be constructed using both narrative and quantitative methods. When these two methods are combined they provide complementary information and insights. Quantitative and narrative models are frequently used to represent scenarios to explore choices and challenges. The IPCC has a long history of assessing scenarios (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; van Vuuren et al. 2011, 2014) (see also AR6 WGI Section 1.6 for a history of scenarios within the IPCC). This WGIII assessment employs a wide range of qualitative and quantitative scenarios including quantitative scenarios developed through a wide and heterogeneous set of tools ranging from spreadsheets to complex computational models (Annex III: Scenarios and Modelling Methods provides further discussion and examples of computational models)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"The concept of an illustrative pathway (IP)  was introduced in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (IPCC 2018b) to highlight a subset of the quantitative scenarios, drawn from a larger pool of published literature, with specific characteristics that would help represent some of the key findings emerging from the assessment in terms of different strategies, ambitions and options available to achieve the Paris goals."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Integrated assessment models (IAMs)  are the primary tools for quantitatively evaluating the technological and macroeconomic implications of decarbonisation, particularly for global long-term pathways. They broadly divide into ‘stylised aggregate benefit-cost models’, and more complex ‘detailed process’ IAMs (Weyant 2017), often mirroring the benefit-cost and cost-effective approaches outlined in Section 1.7.1, with more detailed classification in, for example, Nikas et al. (2019). IAMs embody a number of structural and socio-demographic assumptions and include multiple modelling approaches, ranging from economic optimising behaviour to simulation (see Annex III). Detailed process models can include energy system models used to analyse decarbonisation and ‘net zero’ scenarios by international agencies (e.g., IEA 2020a)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Calculating cost-effective trajectories towards given goals typically involves detailed process IAMs. Often these calculate the dynamic portfolio of technologies consistent with a given climate target. Some track records of technology forecasting in IAMs are outlined in Section 2.5.4, and Box 16.1. Climate targets may be imposed in models in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, constraints on emissions or cumulated emissions (carbon budgets), and the pricing of emissions. The time-path of mitigation costs calculated through these models may be translated into ‘shadow prices’ that (like the social cost of carbon; SCC) offer a benchmark to assess the cost-effectiveness of investments, as used by some governments and companies (Section 1.8.2)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Scenarios in the IPCC and AR6. For AR6, WGIII received submissions of more than 2500 model-based scenarios published in the scientific literature. Such scenarios, which explore different possible evolutions of future energy and land use (with or without climate policy) and associated emissions, are made available through an interactive AR6 scenario database. The main characteristics of pathways in relation to ‘net zero’ emissions and remaining ‘carbon budgets’ are summarised in Box 3.5 in Chapter 3. The warming contribution of CO2 is very closely related to cumulative CO2 emissions, but the remaining ‘carbon budget’ for a given warming depends strongly inter alia on emissions of other GHGs; for targets below 2°C this may affect the corresponding ‘carbon budget’ by about ±220 GtCO2, compared to central estimates of around 500 GtCO2 (for 1.5°C) and 1350 GtCO2 (for 2°C) (AR6 WGI, Table SPM.2) (Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"Pathways and ‘net zero’. The date at which the world needs aggregate emissions to reach net zero for Paris-consistent temperature goals depends both on progress in reducing non-CO2GHG emissions and near-term progress in reducing CO2 emissions. Faster progress in the near term extends the date at which net zero must be reached, while conversely, slower near-term progress brings the date even closer to the present. Some of the modelled 1.5°C pathways with limited overshoot cut global CO2 emissions in half until 2030, which allows for a more gradual decline thereafter, reaching net zero CO2 after 2050; also, net zero GHGs occurs later, with remaining emissions of some non-CO2GHGs compensated by ‘net negative’ CO2 (see Glossary and FAQ 1.3, and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Drawing from the scenarios database, five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs)  were defined for this report (Figure 3.5 and Table 1.1). These are introduced here, with a more complete description and discussion provided in Section 3.2.5. These IMPs were chosen to illustrate key themes with respect to mitigation strategies across the entire WGIII assessment. The IMPs embody both a storyline, which describes in narrative form the key socio-economic characteristics of that scenario, and a quantitative illustration providing numerical values that are internally consistent and comparable across chapters of this report. Quantitative IMPs can be associated directly with specific human activities and provide a quantitative point of reference that links activities in different parts of socio-economic systems. Some parts of the report draw on these quantitative scenarios, whilst others use only the narratives. No assessment of the likelihood of each IMP has been made (as they reflect both human choice and deep uncertainty)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"The IMPs are organised around two dimensions: the level of ambition consistent with meeting Paris goals,  and the scenario features (Figure 1.4). The IMPs explore different pathways potentially consistent with meeting the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. As detailed in Section 3.2.5 and in Chapter 4, a pathway of Gradual Strengthening of current policies (IMP-GS) to 2030, if followed by very fast reductions, may stay below 2°C. The IMP-NEG pathway, with somewhat deeper emission cutbacks to 2030, might enable 1.5°C to be reached but only after significant overshoot, through the subsequent extensive use of CDR in the energy and the industry sectors to achieve net negative global emissions, as discussed in Chapters 3, 6, 7, 10 and 12."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p10,NO_TITLE,"Three other IMPs illustrate different features of technology scenarios with more short-term rapid emission reductions, which could deliver outcomes compatible with the temperature range in the Paris Agreement without large overshoot. Based on the assessment in Section 5.3.3, one key mitigation strategy would be to rely on the opportunities for reducing demand (IMP-LD). Chapters 6 and 7–11 show how energy systems based on accelerated deep renewable energy penetration and electrification can also provide a pathway to deep mitigation (IMP-REN). Chapters 3, 4 and 17 provide insights into how shifting development pathways can lead to deep emission reductions and achieve sustainable development goals (IMP-SP)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p11,NO_TITLE,"These pathways can be implemented with different levels of ambition, that can be measured through the classes (C) of temperature levels from the scenarios database, see Chapter 3 (Table 3.2). In the IMP framework, Section 3.2.5 presents and explores quantitative scenarios that can limit warming to 1.5°C (with a probability of 50% or greater, i.e., C1 for the illustrated quantification of LD, SP and REN, and C2 for NEG scenario), along with other GS pathways which keep warming below 2°C with a probability of 67% or greater (C3). In addition to these primary IMPs, the full scenario database contains sensitivity cases that explore alternative warming levels."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p12,NO_TITLE,"In addition to the IMPs two additional scenarios were selected, which illustrate the consequences of current policies and pledges. Current Policies (CurPol) explores the consequences of continuing along the path of implemented climate policies in 2020 and only a Gradual Strengthening after that, drawing on numerous such scenarios in the literature. Moderate Action (ModAct ) explores the impact of implementing NDCs to 2030, but without further strengthening: both result in global mean temperature above 2°C. They provide benchmarks against which to compare the IMPs."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p13,NO_TITLE,Table 1.1 summarises the main storyline elements of the reference scenarios and each IMP.
wg3_ch01_1.5_p16,NO_TITLE,"What the IMPs do and don’t do. The IMPs are, as their name implies, a set of scenarios meant to illustrate some important themes that run through the entire WGIII assessment. They illustrate that the climate outcomes that individuals and society will face in the century ahead depend on individual and societal choices. In addition, they illustrate that there are multiple ways to successful achievement of Paris long-term temperature goals."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p17,NO_TITLE,"IMPs are not intended to be comprehensive. They are not intended to illustrate all possible themes in this report. They do not, for example, attempt to illustrate the range of alternative socio-economic pathways against which efforts to implement Paris goals may be set, or to reflect variations in potential regional development pathways. They do not explore issues around income distribution or environmental justice, but assume implicitly that  where and how action occurs can be separated from who pays, in ways to adequately address such issues. They are essentially pathways of technological evolution and demand shifts reflecting broad global trends in social choice. The IMPs do not directly assess issues of realisation linked to the ‘drivers and constraints’ summarised in our previous section, and the quantifications use, for the most part, models that are grounded mainly in the Aggregate Economics Frameworks (Section 7.1). As such they reflect primarily the geophysical, economic and technological Dimensions of Assessment, but can be assessed in relation to the full set of Feasibility criteria (Section 1.8.1)."
wg3_ch01_1.5_p18,NO_TITLE,"Together the IMPs provide illustrations of potential future developments that can be shaped by human choices, including: Where are current policies and pledges leading? What is needed to reach specific temperature goals under varying assumptions? What are the consequences of different strategies to meet climate targets (i.e., demand-side strategy, a renewable energy strategy or a strategy with a role for net negative emissions)? What are the consequences of delay? What are the implications for other SDGs of various climate mitigation pathways?"
wg3_ch01_1.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter now sets out approaches to understanding the mitigation challenge, working from its broad location in the context of wider aspirations for sustainable development, then identifying specific analytic approaches, before summarising the corresponding main dimensions used for the assessment of options and pathways in much of the report."
wg3_ch01_1.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change mitigation is one of many goals that societies pursue in the context of sustainable development, as evidenced by the wide range of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Climate change and sustainable development, as well as development more broadly, are interwoven along multiple and complex lines of relationship (Okereke et al. 2009; Fankhauser and McDermott 2016; Okereke and Massaquoi 2017; Gomez-Echeverri 2018a), as highlighted in several previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2007, 2011a, 2014a, 2018b, 2019a). With its significant negative impact on natural systems, food security and infrastructure, loss of lives and territories, species extinction, conflict health, among several other risks, climate change poses a serious threat to development and wellbeing in both rich and poor countries (IPCC 2007, 2011a, 2014a, 2018b, 2019b). Without serious efforts at mitigation and adaptation, climate change could push millions further into poverty and limit the opportunities for economic development (Chapters 4 and 17). It follows that ambitious climate mitigation is necessary to secure a safe climate within which development and well-being can be pursued and sustained."
wg3_ch01_1.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"At the same time, rapid and large-scale economic development (which has in the past driven climate change through land-use change and dependence on fossil fuels), is widely seen as needed to improve global well-being and lift millions especially in low- and middle-income countries out of poverty (Chen et al. 2017; Mugambiwa and Tirivangasi 2017; Lu et al. 2019; Baarsch et al. 2020) (Figure 1.6). This strand of literature emphasises the importance of economic growth including for tackling climate change itself, pointing to the relationship between economic development and climate resilience as well as the role of industry-powered technologies such as electric vehicles in reducing GHG levels and promoting well-being (Heinrichs et al. 2014; Kasztelan 2017). Yet, others argue that the character of social and economic development produced by the nature of capitalist society (Pelling and Manuel-Navarrete 2011; Koch 2012; Malm 2016) is ultimately unsustainable."
wg3_ch01_1.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"There are at least two major implications of the very close link between climate change and development as outlined above. The first is that the choice of development paths made by countries and regions have significant consequences for GHG emissions and efforts to combat climate change (Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 14). The second is that climate mitigation at local, national and global levels cannot be effectively achieved by a narrow focus on ‘climate-specific’ sectors, actors and policies, but rather through a much broader attention to the mix of development choices and the resulting development paths and trajectories (O’Neill et al. 2014) (Chapters 4, 6 and 10)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"As a key staple of IPCC reports and the global climate policy landscape (IPCC 2007, 2014b; van Vuuren et al. 2017; Gidden et al. 2019; Quilcaille et al. 2019) (Chapter 2), integrated assessment models and global scenarios (such as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways – SSPs) highlight the interaction between development paths, climate change and emission stabilisation (Section 3.6). The close links are also recognised in the PA (Section 1.3.1)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The impact of climate change in limiting well-being is most acutely felt by the world’s poorest people, communities, and nations, who have the smallest carbon footprint, constrained capacity to respond and limited voice in important decision-making circles (Okereke and Ehresman 2015; Tosam and Mbih 2015; Mugambiwa and Tirivangasi 2017). The wide variation in the contribution to, and impact of climate change within and across countries makes equity, inequality, justice, and poverty eradication, inescapable aspects of the relationship between sustainable development and climate change (Okereke and Coventry 2016; Klinsky et al. 2017; Reckien et al. 2017; Bos and Gupta 2019; Kayal et al. 2019; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019; Baarsch et al. 2020). This underpins the conclusion, as commonly expressed, that climate action needs to be pursued in the context of sustainable development, equity and poverty eradication (Smit et al. 2001; Tschakert and Olsson 2005; IPCC 2014a, IPCC 2018b; Klinsky and Winkler 2014)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"At one level, sustainable development can be seen as a meta framework for integrating climate action with other global sustainability goals (Casadio Tarabusi and Guarini 2013; Antal and Van Den Bergh 2016). Fundamentally, the concept of sustainable development underscores the interlinkages and interdependence of human and natural systems and the need to balance economic, social, and environmental (including climate pollution) aspects in development planning and processes (Nunan 2017; Gomez-Echeverri 2018b; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Despite the appeal of the concept, tensions remain over the interpretation and practical application, with acute disagreements regarding what the balancing entails in real life, how to measure well-being, which goals to set, and the means through which such goals might be pursued (Arrow et al. 2011; Dasgupta et al. 2015; Michelsen et al. 2016; Okereke and Massaquoi 2017; UNEP 2018b; Haberl et al. 2019; Shang et al. 2019; Sugiawan et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Moreover, countries differ enormously in their respective situation regarding their development path – a condition which affects their capability, goals, priorities and approach to the pursuit of sustainability (Shi et al. 2016; Ramos-Mejía et al. 2018; Okereke et al. 2019). Most of the literature recognises that despite its limitations, sustainable development with its emphasis on integrating social, economic and environmental goals, provides a more comprehensive approach to the pursuit of planetary health and human well-being. Sustainable development is then not a static objective but a dynamic framework for measuring human progress (Costanza et al. 2016; Fotis and Polemis 2018), relevant for all countries even if different groups of nations experience the challenge of sustainability in different ways."
wg3_ch01_1.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Much like sustainable development, concepts like low-carbon development (Mulugetta and Urban 2010; Yuan et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2019), climate-compatible development (CCD) (Mitchell and Maxwell 2010; Tompkins et al. 2013; Stringer et al. 2014; Bickersteth et al. 2017) and more recently climate-resilient development (CRD) (Fankhauser and McDermott 2016; Henly-Shepard et al. 2018; IPCC 2018b) have all emerged as ideas, tools and frameworks, intended to bring together the goals of climate mitigation and the SDGs, as well as development more broadly. Figure 1.5 suggests that the prospects for realising a climate-resilient and equitable world are enhanced by a process of transformation and development trajectories that seek to limit global warming while also achieving the SDGs. The SDGs represent medium-term goals, and long-term sustainability requires continued effort to keep the world along a climate-resilient development path. A key feature of development or transformation pathways that achieve a climate-resilient world is that they maximise the synergies and minimise the trade-offs between climate mitigation and other sustainable development goals (Klausbruckner et al. 2016; Thornton and Comberti 2017; Wüstemann et al. 2017; Dagnachew et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Mainali et al. 2018). Crucially, the nature of trade-offs and timing of related decisions will vary across countries depending on circumstances including the level of development, capability and access to resources (Cross-Chapter Box 5, Shifting Development Paths to Increase Sustainability, in Chapter 4)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Other concepts such as ‘Doughnut Economics’ (Raworth 2018), ecological modernisation, and mainstreaming are also used to convey ideals of development pathways that take sustainability, climate mitigation, and environmental limits seriously (Dale et al. 2015a). Mainstreaming focuses on incorporating climate change into national development activities, such as the building of infrastructure (Wamsler and Pauleit 2016; Runhaar et al. 2018). The ‘green economy’ and green growth – growth without undermining ecological systems, partly by gaining economic value from cleaner technologies and systems and is inclusive and equitable in its outcomes – has gained popularity in both developed and developing countries as an approach for harnessing economic growth to address environmental issues (Bina 2013; Georgeson et al. 2017; Capasso et al. 2019; Song et al. 2020; Hao et al. 2021). However, critics argue that green economy ultimately emphasises economic growth to the detriment of other important aspects of human welfare such as social justice (Death 2014; Adelman 2015; Kamuti 2015), and challenge the central idea that it is possible to decouple economic activity and growth (measured as GDP increment) from increasing use of biophysical resources (raw materials, energy) (Jackson and Victor 2019; Parrique et al. 2019; Haberl et al. 2020; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Vadén et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch01_1.6.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Literature on degrowth, post growth, and post development questions the sustainability and imperative of more growth especially in already industrialised countries and argues that prosperity and the ‘Good Life’ are not immutably tied to economic growth (Asara et al. 2015; Escobar 2015; Latouche 2018; Kallis 2019) (Section 5.2.1). The concept of Just Transition also stresses the need to integrate justice concerns so as to not impose hardship on already marginalised populations within and between countries (Evans and Phelan 2016; Goddard and Farrelly 2018; Heffron and McCauley 2018; Smith, Jackie and Patterson 2018; McCauley and Heffron 2018) (Section 1.7.2). The key insight is that pursuing climate goals in the context of sustainable development requires holistic thinking including on how to measure well-being, serious consideration of the notion of ecological limits, at least some level of decoupling and certainly choices and decision-making approaches that exploit and maximise the synergy and minimise the trade-off between climate mitigation and other sustainable development goals. It also requires consideration of equity and justice within and between countries. However, ideas of a synergistic relationship between development and climate mitigation can sometimes offer limited practical guidelines for reconciling the tensions that are often present in practical policymaking (Ferguson et al. 2014; Dale et al. 2015b; Kasztelan 2017; Kotzé 2018)."

The current positions of different regions are shown by bubbles, with sizes representing total GHG emissions. Figure 1.6 also shows the estimated position of the SDGs zone for the year 2030, and a ‘sustainable development corridor’ as countries reach towards higher HDI and lower emissions.

Beyond 2030, the sustainable development corridor allows for increasing levels of human development while lowering per-capita GHG emissions."

Indeed, there are regions with HIHD levels above 0.8 which have GHG per-capita emissions lower than several with HIHD levels of around 0.5. The mitigation challenge involves countries at many different stages of development seeking paths towards higher welfare with low emissions."
wg3_ch01_1.6.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"From Figure 1.6, there are two distinct dimensions to sustainable development pathways for fulfilling the SDGs. In terms of per-capita GHG emissions (the vertical), some regions have such low levels that they could increase and still be below the global average required in 2030 for the world to be on path to fulfil the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, other regions with high per-capita GHG emissions would require a rapid transformation in technologies and practices. It is against this background that Dubash (2019) emphasises placing the need for urgent action on climate change in the context of domestic political priorities and the institutions within which national frameworks are crystallised."

This literature emphasises the need for less developed countries to have sufficient room for development while addressing climate change (Winkler et al. 2013; Pan et al. 2014; Gajevic Sayegh 2017; Robinson and Shine 2018; Warlenius 2018). Meanwhile, many countries reliant on fossil fuels, related technologies and economic activities, are eager to ensure tax revenues are maintained, workers and industries have income and justice is embedded in the economic transformations required to limit GHG emissions (Cronin et al. 2021)."

Below some thresholds of absolute poverty, more consumption is necessary for development to lead to well-being (Section 5.2.1.1), which may not be the case at higher levels of consumption (Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Steinberger et al. 2020) (Section 1.7.2)."

It also requires a focus on equity considerations to avoid climate-induced harm, as well as unfairness that can result from urgent actions to cut emissions (Pan et al. 2014; Robiou du Pont et al. 2017; Kartha et al. 2018a). This is ever more important as the diminishing carbon budget has intensified debates on which countries should have the greatest claim to the ‘remaining space’ for emissions (Raupach et al. 2014) or production (McGlade and Ekins 2015), amplified by persistent concerns over the insufficiency of support for means of implementation, to support ambitious mitigation efforts (Pickering et al. 2015; Weikmans and Roberts 2019)."

Organised partly as reflected in the quotes above, these include aggregated (principally, economic) frameworks to evaluate system-level choices; ethical perspectives on values and equity including stages of development and distributional concerns; and transition frameworks which focus on the processes and actors involved in major technological and social transitions. These need to be complemented by a fourth set of approaches which shine more light on psychological/behavioural and political factors. All these frameworks are relevant, and together they point to the multiple perspectives and actions required if the positive drivers of emission reduction summarised in Section 4 are to outweigh the barriers and overcome the constraints."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1_p1,Cost-benefit Analysis and Cost-effectiveness Analysis ,"Some of the most established and influential approaches to understanding the aggregate causes and consequences of climate change and mitigation across societies, draw upon economic theories and modelling to generate global emission pathways in the absence of climate policies and to study alternative mitigation pathways (described in detail in Section 3.2.5, and Appendix 3). The underlying economic concepts aggregate wealth or other measures of welfare based on utilitarian ethical foundations, and in most applications, a number of additional assumptions detailed in AR5 (Chapters 2 and 3)."

One, as pioneered by Nordhaus (1992, 2008) attempts to monetise overall climate damages and mitigation costs so as to strike a ‘cost-benefit optimum’ pathway. More detailed and empirically-grounded ‘cost-effectiveness analysis’ explores pathways that would minimise mitigation costs (Ekholm 2014; IPCC 2014a Section 2.5; Weyant 2017) for given targets (e.g., as agreed in international negotiations, see Section 3.2 in Chapter 3). Bothapproaches recognise that resources are limited and climate change competes with other priorities in government policymaking, and are generally examined with some form of Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) (Section 1.5 and Appendix III). Depending on the regional disaggregation of the modelling tools used and on the scope of the analyses, these studies may or may not address distributional aspects within and across nations associated with climate policies (Bauer et al. 2020)."

The salience of risks has also been amplified by improved understanding of climate ‘tipping points’ (Lontzek et al. 2015; Lenton et al. 2019); valuations should reflect that cutting emissions reduces not only average expected damages, but also the risk of catastrophic events (IWG 2021)."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Discounting. The role of time discounting in weighting future climate change impacts against today’s costs of mitigating emissions has been long recognised (Weitzman 1994, 2001; Nordhaus 2007; Stern 2007; Dasgupta 2008). Its importance is underlined in analytical Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) (Golosov et al. 2014; van den Bijgaart et al. 2016; van der Ploeg and Rezai 2019) (Annex III). Economic literature suggests applying risk-free, public, and long-term interest rates when evaluating overall climate strategy (Weitzman 2001; Dasgupta 2008; Arrow et al. 2013; Groom and Hepburn 2017). Expert elicitations indicate values around 2% (majority) to 3% (Drupp et al. 2018). This is lower than in many of the studies reviewed in earlier IPCC assessments, and many IAM studies since, and by increasing the weight accorded to the future would increase current ‘optimal effort’. The US Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon used 3% as its central value (IAWG 2016; Li and Pizer 2018; Adler et al. 2017).

The economic damages from climate change at the nationally aggregated and sub-national level are very diverse (Moore et al. 2017; Ricke et al. 2018; Carleton et al. 2020). A ‘global damage function’ necessarily implies aggregating impacts across people and countries with different levels of income, and over generations, a process which obscures the strategic considerations that drive climate policymaking (Keohane and Oppenheimer 2016). Economics acknowledges there is no single, objectively defined ‘social welfare function’ (IPCC 1995, 2014a). This applies also to the distribution of responses: both underline the relevance of equity (next section) and global negotiations to determine national and collective objectives."

A new generation of cost-benefits analysis, based on projections of actual observed damages, results in stronger mitigation efforts as optimal (Glanemann et al. 2020; Hänsel et al. 2020). Overall, the combination of improved damage functions with the wider consensus on low discount rates (as well as lower mitigation costs due to innovation) has increasingly yielded ‘optimal’ results from benefit-cost studies in line with the range established in the Paris Agreement (Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3)."

wg3_ch01_1.7.1.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Cost-benefit IAMs utilise damage functions to derive a social cost of CO2 emissions’ (SCC – the additional cost to society of a pulse of CO2 emissions). One review considered that ‘the best estimate’ of the optimal (near-term) level ‘still ranges from a few tens to a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon’ (Tol 2018), with various recent studies in the hundreds, taking account of risks (Taconet et al. 2019), learning (Ekholm 2018) and distribution (Ricke et al. 2018). In addition to the importance of uncertainty/risk, aggregation, and realistic damage functions as noted, on which some progress has been made, some reviews additionally critique how IAMs represent abatement costs in terms of energy efficiency and innovation (e.g., Farmer et al. 2015; Rosen and Guenther 2015; Keen 2021) (Sections 1.7.3 and 1.7.4). IAMs may better reflect associated ‘rebound’ at system level (Saunders et al. 2021), and inefficient implementation would raise mitigation costs (Homma et al. 2019); conversely, co-benefits– most extensively estimated for air quality, valued at a few tens of USD per tCO2-eq across 16 studies (Karlsson et al. 2020) – complement global with additional local benefits (Table 1.2)."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Whereas many of these factors affect primarily cost-benefit evaluation, discounting also determines the cost-effective trajectory: Emmerling et al. (2019) find that, for a remaining budget of 1000 GtCO2, reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% would more than double current efforts, limit ‘overshoot’, greatly reduce a late rush to negative emissions, and improve intergenerational justice by more evenly distributing policy costs across the 21st century."

Optimising a path towards a given temperature goal by a fixed date (e.g., 2100) gives time-inconsistent results backloaded to large, last-minute investment in carbon dioxide removal (CDR). ‘Cost-effective’ optimisations generate less initial effort than equivalent  cost-benefit models (Dietz and Venmans 2019; Gollier 2021) as they do not incorporate benefits of reducing impacts earlier."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"‘Efficient pathways’ are affected by inertia and innovation. Inertia implies amplifying action on long-lived investments and infrastructure that could otherwise lock-in emissions for many decades (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018; Baldwin et al. 2020). Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) discusses interactions between near-, medium- and long-term actions in global pathways, particularly vis-à-vis  inertia. Also, to the extent that early action induces low-carbon innovation, it ‘multiplies’ the optimal effort (for given damage assumptions), because it facilitates subsequent cheaper abatement. For example, a ‘learning-by-doing’ analysis concludes that early deployment of expensive PV was of net global economic benefit, due to induced innovation (Newbery 2018)."

More recently developing have been formal economic theories of endogenous growth building on, for example, Romer (1986), and developments of Schumpeterian creative destruction (Aghion et al. 2021) and evolutionary economic theories which abandon any notion of full or stable resource utilisation even as a reference concept (Nelson and Winter 1982; Freeman and Perez 1988; Carlsson and Stankiewicz 1991; Freeman and Louçã 2001; Perez 2001)."

Such approaches have been variously applied in policy evaluation (Walton 2014; Moore et al. 2018), and specifically for global decarbonisation (e.g., Barker and Crawford-Brown 2014 ) using global simulation models. Because these have no natural reference ‘least lost’ trajectory, they illustrate varied and divergent pathways and tend to emphasise the diversity of possibilities and relevant policies, particularly linked to innovation and potentially ‘sensitive intervention points’ (Farmer et al. 2019) (Section 1.7.3).

One review considered that ‘the best estimate’ of the optimal (near-term) level ‘still ranges from a few tens to a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon’ (Tol 2018), with various recent studies in the hundreds, taking account of risks (Taconet et al. 2019), learning (Ekholm 2018) and distribution (Ricke et al. 2018). In addition to the importance of uncertainty/risk, aggregation, and realistic damage functions as noted, on which some progress has been made, some reviews additionally critique how IAMs represent abatement costs in terms of energy efficiency and innovation (e.g., Farmer et al. 2015; Rosen and Guenther 2015; Keen 2021) (Sections 1.7.3 and 1.7.4). IAMs may better reflect associated ‘rebound’ at system level (Saunders et al. 2021), and inefficient implementation would raise mitigation costs (Homma et al. 2019); conversely, co-benefits– most extensively estimated for air quality, valued at a few tens of USD per tCO2-eq across 16 studies (Karlsson et al. 2020) – complement global with additional local benefits (Table 1.2)."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Whereas many of these factors affect primarily cost-benefit evaluation, discounting also determines the cost-effective trajectory: Emmerling et al. (2019) find that, for a remaining budget of 1000 GtCO2, reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% would more than double current efforts, limit ‘overshoot’, greatly reduce a late rush to negative emissions, and improve intergenerational justice by more evenly distributing policy costs across the 21st century."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Care is required to clarify what is optimised (Dietz and Venmans 2019). Optimising a path towards a given temperature goal by a fixed date (e.g., 2100) gives time-inconsistent results backloaded to large, last-minute investment in carbon dioxide removal (CDR). ‘Cost-effective’ optimisations generate less initial effort than equivalent  cost-benefit models (Dietz and Venmans 2019; Gollier 2021) as they do not incorporate benefits of reducing impacts earlier."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"‘Efficient pathways’ are affected by inertia and innovation. Inertia implies amplifying action on long-lived investments and infrastructure that could otherwise lock-in emissions for many decades (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018; Baldwin et al. 2020). Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) discusses interactions between near-, medium- and long-term actions in global pathways, particularly vis-à-vis  inertia. Also, to the extent that early action induces low-carbon innovation, it ‘multiplies’ the optimal effort (for given damage assumptions), because it facilitates subsequent cheaper abatement. For example, a ‘learning-by-doing’ analysis concludes that early deployment of expensive PV was of net global economic benefit, due to induced innovation (Newbery 2018)."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Research thus increasingly emphasises the need to understand climate transformation in terms of dynamic, rather than static, efficiency (Gillingham and Stock 2018). This means taking account of inertia, learning and various additional sources of ‘path-dependence’. Including induced innovation in stylised IAMs can radically change the outlook (Acemoglu et al. 2012, 2016), albeit with limitations (Pottier et al. 2014); many more detailed-process IAMs now do include endogenous technical change (as reviewed in Yang et al. 2018 and Grubb et al. 2021b) (Annex III)."
wg3_ch01_1.7.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"These dynamic and uncertainty effects typically justify greater upfront effort (Kalkuhl et al. 2012; Bertram et al. 2015), including accelerated international diffusion (Schultes et al. 2018), and strengthen optimal initial effort in cost-benefit models (Baldwin et al. 2020; Grubb et al. 2021b). Approaches to risk premia common in finance would similarly amplify the initial mitigation effort, declining as uncertainties reduce (Daniel et al. 2019)."

These including long-standing theories from the 1930s (e.g., Schumpeter 1934; Keynes 1936) to understand situations of structurally underemployed resources, potential financial instabilities (Minsky 1986), and related economic approaches which emphasise time dimensions (e.g., recent reviews in Legrand and Hagemann 2017; Stern 2018). More recently developing have been formal economic theories of endogenous growth building on, for example, Romer (1986), and developments of Schumpeterian creative destruction (Aghion et al. 2021) and evolutionary economic theories which abandon any notion of full or stable resource utilisation even as a reference concept (Nelson and Winter 1982; Freeman and Perez 1988; Carlsson and Stankiewicz 1991; Freeman and Louçã 2001; Perez 2001)."

These take inherently dynamic views of economies as continually evolving systems with continuously unfolding and path-dependent properties, and emphasise uncertainty in contrast to any predictable or default optimality. Such approaches have been variously applied in policy evaluation (Walton 2014; Moore et al. 2018), and specifically for global decarbonisation (e.g., Barker and Crawford-Brown 2014 ) using global simulation models. Because these have no natural reference ‘least lost’ trajectory, they illustrate varied and divergent pathways and tend to emphasise the diversity of possibilities and relevant policies, particularly linked to innovation and potentially ‘sensitive intervention points’ (Farmer et al. 2019) (Section 1.7.3). They also illustrate that different representations of innovation and financial markets together can explain why estimated impacts of mitigation on GDP can differ very widely (potentially even in sign), between different model types (Chapter 15, Section 15.6.3 and Box 15.7)."

Its global dimension, in a world of sovereign states which have only fragmentary responsibility and control, makes it ‘difficult to generate the moral consideration and necessary political will’. Its impacts are intergenerational but future generations have no voice in contemporary affairs, the usual mechanism for addressing distributional injustices, amplified by the intrinsic inequity of wealthy big emitters impacting particularly poorer victims. He argues that these are exacerbated by a third, theoretical failure to acknowledge a central need for ‘moral sensitivity, compassion, transnational and transgenerational care, and other forms of ethical concern to rise to the surface’ to help guide effective climate action.

Typically, new technologies, ideas and associated systems initially grow slowly in absolute terms, but may then ‘take-off’ in a phase of exponential growth as they emerge from a position of niche into mainstream diffusion, as indicated by the ‘S-curve’ growth in Figure 1.7 (lower panel). These dynamics arise from interactions between innovation (in technologies, companies and other organisations), markets, infrastructure and institutions, at multiple levels (Geels et al. 2017; Kramer 2018). Consequently, interdisciplinary perspectives are needed (Turnheim et al. 2015; Geels et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2020).

Transitions often start with niche alternatives (Grin et al. 2010; Köhler et al. 2019), which may break through to wider diffusion (second stage in Figure 1.8), especially if external landscape developments ‘create pressures on the regime that lead to cracks, tensions and windows of opportunity’ (Rotmans et al. 2001; Geels 2010); an example is climate change putting sustained pressure on current regimes of energy production and consumption (Kuzemko et al. 2016).

Like MLP, these are related to different social and temporal scales, as applied also in studying the ‘adaptive finance’ in UK electricity transition (Hall et al. 2017).

wg3_ch01_1.7.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Sustainability may require purposeful actions at the different levels to foster the growth of sustainable technologies and practices, including support for niche alternatives (Grin et al. 2010). The middle level (established ‘socio-technical regime’) tends to resist major change, reforms generally involve pressures from the other two levels. Thus, transitions can be accelerated by policies appropriately targeting relevant actors at the different levels (Köhler et al. 2019), the foundations for ‘three pillars of policy’ (Grubb et al. 2014), which logically evolve in the course of transition (Figure 2.6a). Incumbent industries have to adapt if they are to thrive within the growth of new systems. Policy may need to balance existing socio-technical systems with strategic investment and institutional development of the emerging niches (e.g., the maintenance of energy provision and energy security with the development of renewables), and help manage declining industries (Koasidis et al. 2020)."

The Second World War demonstrated the extent to which crises can motivate (sometimes positive) change across complex social and technical systems, including industry, and agriculture which then doubled its productivity over 15 years (Roberts and Geels 2019b). In practice, climate change may involve a combination of (reactive) transformational adaptation, and (proactive) societal transformation (Feola 2015), the latter seen as reorientation (including values and norms) in a sustainable direction (Section 5.4), including, for example, ‘democratisation’ in energy systems (Sorman et al. 2020). Business change management principles could be relevant to support positive social change (Stephan et al. 2016). Overall, effective transitions rest on appropriate enabling conditions, which can also link socio-technical transitions to broader development pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16)."

However, a few distinct types of quantitative models of ‘socio-technical energy transition’ (Li et al. 2015) have emerged. For policy evaluation, transitions can be viewed as processes in which dynamic efficiency (Section 1.7.2) dominates over static allocative efficiency, with potential ‘positive intervention points’ (Farmer et al. 2019). Given inherent uncertainties, there are obvious risks (e.g., Alic and Sarewitz 2016). All this may make an evaluation framework of risks and opportunities more appropriate than traditional cost-benefit (Mercure et al. 2021), and (drawing on lessons from renewables and electric vehicles) create foundations for sector-based international ‘positive sum cooperation’ in climate mitigation (Sharpe and Lenton 2021)."
wg3_ch01_1.7.4_p1,Psychological and Behavioural Dimensions ,"The continued increase in global emissions to 2019, despite three decades of scientific warnings of ever-greater clarity and urgency, motivates growing attention in the literature to the psychological ‘faults of our rationality’ (Bryck and Ellis 2016), and the political nature of climate mitigation."

Many of these features of human reasoning create ‘psychological distance’ from climate change (Spence et al. 2012; Marshall 2014). These can impede adequate personal responses, in addition to the collective nature of the problem, where such problems can take the form of ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, neglected and so becoming ‘unknown knowns’ (Sarewitz 2020). These decision processes, and the perceptions that shape them, have been studied through different lenses from psychology (Weber 2016) to sociology (Guilbeault et al. 2018), and media studies (Boykoff 2011). Karlsson and Gilek (2020) identify science denialism and ‘decision thresholds’ as key mechanisms of delay."

Incorporating behavioural and social dynamics in models is required particularly to better represent the demand side (Nikas et al. 2020), for example, Safarzyńska (2018) demonstrates how behavioural factors change responses to carbon pricing relative to other instruments. A key perspective is to eschew ‘either/or’ between economic and behavioural frameworks, as the greatest effects often involve combining behavioural dimensions (e.g., norms, social influence networks, convenience and quality assurance) with financial incentives and information (Stern et al. 2010).

Many of these features of human reasoning create ‘psychological distance’ from climate change (Spence et al. 2012; Marshall 2014). These can impede adequate personal responses, in addition to the collective nature of the problem, where such problems can take the form of ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, neglected and so becoming ‘unknown knowns’ (Sarewitz 2020). These decision processes, and the perceptions that shape them, have been studied through different lenses from psychology (Weber 2016) to sociology (Guilbeault et al. 2018), and media studies (Boykoff 2011).

Incorporating behavioural and social dynamics in models is required particularly to better represent the demand side (Nikas et al. 2020), for example, Safarzyńska (2018) demonstrates how behavioural factors change responses to carbon pricing relative to other instruments. A key perspective is to eschew ‘either/or’ between economic and behavioural frameworks, as the greatest effects often involve combining behavioural dimensions (e.g., norms, social influence networks, convenience and quality assurance) with financial incentives and information (Stern et al. 2010).

wg3_ch01_1.8.1_p12,NO_TITLE,"Some fundamental criteria may span across several dimensions.

wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Along with the long lifetime of various physical assets detailed in AR5, AR6 underlines the exceptional degree of path-dependence in urban systems (Chapter 8) and associated buildings (Chapter 9) and transport (Chapter 10) sectors, but it is a feature across almost all the major emitting sectors. The (typically expected) operating lifetimes of existing carbon-emitting assets would involve anticipated emissions (often but inaccurately called ‘committed’ emissions in the literature), substantially exceeding the remaining carbon budgets associated with 1.5°C pathways (Chapter 2.7). Ongoing GHG-intensive investments, including those from basic industrialisation in poorer countries, are adding to this."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"The fact that investors anticipate a level of fossil fuel use that is not compatible with severe climate constraints creates a clear risk of ‘stranded assets’ facing these investors (Box 6.2), and others who depend on them, which itself raises issues of equity. A multi-dimensional/multi-framework assessment helps to explain why such investments have continued, even in rich countries, and the consequent risks, and the complexity of shifting such investments in all countries. It may also inform approaches that could exploit path-dependence in clean energy systems, if there is sufficient investment in building up the low-GHG industries, infrastructures and networks required."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Carbon pricing. Appraisal of policy instruments also requires such multi-dimensional assessment .  Stern’s (2007) reference to climate change as ‘the greatest market failure in history’ highlights that damages inflicted by climate change are not properly costed in most economic decision-making. Economic perspectives emphasise the value of removing fossil fuel subsidies, and pricing emissions to ‘internalise’ in economic decision-making the ‘external’ damages imposed by GHG emissions, and/or to meet agreed goals. Aggregate economic frameworks generally indicate carbon pricing (on principles which extend to other gases) as the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, notwithstanding various market failures which complicate this logic. 9 The High-Level Commission on carbon pricing (Stern and Stiglitz 2017) estimated an appropriate range as USD40–80 tCO2 in 2020, rising steadily thereafter. In practice the extent and level of carbon pricing implemented to date is far lower than this or than most economic analyses now recommend (Section 3.6.1), and nowhere is carbon pricing the only instrument deployed."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"A socio-cultural and equity perspective emphasises that the faith in and role of markets varies widely between countries – many energy systems do not in fact operate on a basis of competitive markets – and that because market-based carbon pricing involves large revenue transfers, it must also contend with major distributional effects and political viability (Prinn et al. 2017; Klenert et al. 2018), both domestic (Chapter 13) and international (Chapter 14). A major review (Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019) finds persistent distributional concerns (rich incumbents have also been vocal in using arguments about impacts on the poor (Rennkamp 2019)), but suggests these may be addressed by combining redistribution of revenues with support for low-carbon innovation. Measures could include redistributing the tax revenue to favour of low-income groups or differentiated carbon taxes (Metcalf 2009; Klenert and Mattauch 2016; Stiglitz 2019), including ‘dual track’ approaches (van den Bergh et al. 2020). To an extent though, all these depend on levels of trust, and institutional capacity."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"Technological and transitions perspectives in turn find carbon-pricing incentives may only stimulate incremental improvements, but other instruments may be much more effective for driving deeper innovation and transitions (Chapters 14, 15 and 16), whilst psychological and behavioural studies emphasise many factors beyond only pricing (Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2). In practice, a wide range of policy instruments are used (Chapter 13)."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Finally, in economic theory, negotiations on a common carbon price (or other common policies) may have large benefits (less subject to ‘free riding’) compared to a focus on negotiating national targets (Cramton et al. 2017a). The fact that this has never even been seriously considered (outside some efforts in the EU) may reflect the exceptional sovereignty sensitivities around taxation and cultural differences around the role of markets. However, carbon-pricing concepts can be important outside of the traditional market (‘tax or trading’) applications. A ’social cost of carbon’ can be used to evaluate government and regulatory decisions, to compensate for inadequate carbon prices in actual markets, and by companies to reflect the external damage of their emissions and strategic risks of future carbon controls (Zhou and Wen 2020). An agreed ‘social value of mitigation activities’ could form a basic index for underwriting risks in low-carbon investments internationally (Hourcade et al. 2021a)."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Thus, practical assessment of carbon pricing inherently needs multi-dimensional analysis. The realities of political economy and lobbying have to date severely limited the implementation of carbon pricing (Mildenberger 2020), leading some social scientists to ask ‘Can we price carbon?’ (Rabe 2018). Slowly growing adoption (World Bank 2019) suggests ‘yes’, but only through complex evolution of efforts: a study of 66 implemented carbon-pricing policies show important effects of regional clustering, international processes, and seizing political windows of opportunity (Skovgaard et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Just Transitions. Finally, whilst ‘transition’ frameworks may explain potential dynamics that could transform systems, a multi-dimensional/multi-framework assessment underlines the motivation for Just Transitions (Sections 1.6.2.3 and 4.5). This can be defined as a transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy which is considered sufficiently equitable for the affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Jasanoff 2018; Newell and Mulvaney 2013). As noted, sufficient equity is not only an ethical issue but an enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated mitigation (Klinsky and Winkler 2018; Urpelainen and Van de Graaf 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). Perception of fairness influences the effectiveness of cooperative action (Winkler et al. 2018), and this can apply to affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Jasanoff 2018)."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p13,NO_TITLE,"A Just Transitions framing can also enable coalitions which integrate low-carbon transformations with concerns for climate adaptation (Patterson et al. 2018). All this explains the emergence of ‘Just Transition Commissions’ in several of the more ambitious developed countries and complex social packages for coal phase-out in Europe (Sovacool et al. 2019; Green and Gambhir 2020) (Section 4.5), as well as reference to the concept in the PA and its emphasis in the Talanoa Dialogue and Silesia Declaration (Section 1.2.2)."
wg3_ch01_1.8.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"Whilst the broad concepts of Just Transitions have roots going back decades, its specific realisation in relation to climate change is of course complex: Section 4.5 identifies at least eight distinct elements proposed in the literature, even before considering the international dimensions."
wg3_ch01_1.9_p1,NO_TITLE,"Previous sections have highlighted the multiple factors that drive and constrain climate action, the complex interconnection between climate mitigation and other societal objectives, and the diversity of analytical frames for interpreting these connections. Despite the complexities, there are signs of progress including increased societal awareness, change in social attitudes, policy commitments by a broad range of actors and sustained emission reductions in some jurisdictions. Nevertheless, emission trends at the global level remains incompatible with the goals agreed in the Paris Agreement. Fundamentally, the challenge of how best to urgently scale up and speed up the climate-mitigation effort at all scales – from local to global – to the pace needed to address the climate challenge is that of governance understood as ‘modes and mechanisms to steer society’ (Jordan et al. 2015). The concept of governance encompasses the ability to plan and create the organisations needed to achieve a desired goal (Güney 2017) and the process of interaction among actors involved in a common problem for making and implementing decisions (Kooiman 2003; Hufty 2012)."
wg3_ch01_1.9_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change governance has been projected as conscious transformation at unprecedented scale and speed involving a contest of ideas and experimentation across scales of authority and jurisdiction (Hildén et al. 2017; Kivimaa et al. 2017; Laakso et al. 2017; Gordon 2018; van der Heijden 2018). Yet, there remains a sense that achieving the urgent transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable world requires significant innovation in governance (Hoffmann 2011; Stevenson and Dryzek 2013; Aykut 2016)."
wg3_ch01_1.9_p3,NO_TITLE,"Starting from an initial focus on multilateral agreements, climate change governance has long evolved into a complex polycentric structure that spans from the global to national and sub-national levels, with ‘multiple parallel initiatives involving a range of actors at different levels of governance’ (Okereke et al. 2009) and relying on both formal and informal networks and policy channels (Bulkeley et al. 2014; Jordan et al. 2015). At the international level, implementation of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC more broadly is proceeding in parallel with other activities in an increasingly diverse landscape of loosely coordinated institutions, constituting ‘regime complex’ (Keohane and Victor 2011 ), and new cooperative efforts demonstrate an evolution in the shifting authority given to actors at different levels of governance (Chan et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch01_1.9_p4,NO_TITLE,"Multi-level governance has been used to highlight the notion that the processes involved in making and implementing decisions on climate change are no longer the exclusive preserve of government actors but rather involve a range of non-nation state actors such as cities, businesses, and civil society organisations (IPCC 2014a; Bäckstrand et al. 2017; Jordan et al. 2018) (Chapter 13, and Sections 13.3.1 and 13.5.2). Increased multi-level participation of sub-national actors, along with a diversity of other transnational and non-state actors has helped to facilitate increased awareness, experimentation, innovation, learning and achieving benefits at multiple scales. Multi-level participation in governance systems can help to build coalitions to support climate change mitigation policies (Roberts et al. 2018) and fragmentation has the potential to take cooperative and even synergistic forms (Biermann et al. 2009)."
wg3_ch01_1.9_p5,NO_TITLE,"However, there is no guarantee that multi-level governance can successfully deal with complex human-ecological systems (York et al. 2005; Biermann et al. 2017; Di Gregorio et al. 2019). Multi-level governance can contribute to an extremely polarised discussion and policy blockage rather than enabling policy innovation (Fisher and Leifeld 2019). A fragmented governance landscape may lead to coordination and legitimacy gaps undermining the regime (Nasiritousi and Bäckstrand 2019). The realities of the ‘drivers and constraints’ detailed in Section 4, the ‘glocal’ nature of climate change, the divided authority in world politics, diverse preferences of public and private entities across the spectrum, and pervasive suspicions of free riding, imply the challenge as how to incrementally deepen cooperation in a polycentric global system, rather than seeking a single, integrated governance (Keohane and Victor 2016)."

However widespread and enduring cooperation can only be expected when the benefits outweigh the cost of cooperation and when the interests of key actors are sufficiently aligned (Barrett 1994; Finus and Rübbelke 2008; Victor 2011; Mainali et al. 2018; Tulkens 2019). Investigating the distribution and role of hard and soft power resources, capacities and power relations within and across different jurisdictional levels is therefore important to uncover hindrances to effective climate governance (Marquardt 2017). Institutions at international and national levels are also critical as they have the ability to mediate the power and interest of actors, and sustain cooperation based on equity and fair rules and outcomes. Governance, in fact, helps to align and moderate the interests of actors as well as to shift perceptions, including the negative, burden-sharing narratives that often accompany discussion about climate action, especially in international negotiations. It is also useful for engaging the wider public and international networks in imagining low-carbon societies (e.g., Levy and Spicer 2013; Milkoreit 2017; Nikoleris et al. 2017; Wapner and Elver 2017; Bengtsson Sonesson et al. 2019; Fatemi et al. 2020). Experimentation also represents an important source of governance innovation and capability formation, linked to global knowledge and technology flows, which could reshape emergent socio-technical regimes and so contribute to alternative development pathways (Berkhout et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2018; Turnheim et al. 2018; Lo and Castán Broto 2019)."
wg3_ch01_1.10_p1,NO_TITLE,"Global conditions have changed substantially since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report in 2014. The Paris Agreement and the SDGs provided a new international context, but global intergovernmental cooperation has been under intense stress. Growing direct impacts of climate change are unambiguous and movements of protest and activism – in countries and transnational organisations at many levels – have grown. Global emissions growth had slowed but not stopped up to 2018/19, albeit with more diverse national trends. Growing numbers of countries have adopted ‘net zero’ CO2 and/or GHG emission goals and decarbonisation or low-carbon growth strategies, but the current NDCs to 2030 collectively would barely reduce global emissions below present levels (Section 1.3.3). An unfolding technology revolution is making significant contributions in some countries, but as yet its global impact is limited. Global climate change can only be tackled within, and if integrated with, the wider context of sustainable development, and related social goals including equity concerns. Countries and their populations have many conflicting priorities. Developing countries in particular have multiple urgent needs associated with earlier stages of sustainable development as reflected in the non-climate SDGs. Developed countries are amongst the most unsustainable in terms of overall consumption, but also face social constraints particularly arising from distributional impacts of climate policies."
wg3_ch01_1.10_p2,NO_TITLE,"The assessment of the key drivers for, and barriers against mitigation undertaken in this chapter underscore the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of climate mitigation. Historically, much of the academic analysis of mitigating climate change, particularly global approaches, has focused on modelling costs and pathways, and discussion about ‘optimal’ policy instruments. Developments since AR5 have continued to highlight the role of a wide range of factors intersecting the political, economic, social and institutional domains. Yet despite such complexities, there are signs of progress emerging from years of policy effort in terms of technology, social attitudes, and emission reductions in some countries, with tentative signs of impact on the trajectory of global emissions. The challenge remains how best to urgently scale up and speed up the climate mitigation effort at all scales – from local to global – to achieve the level of mitigation needed to address the problem as indicated by climate science. A related challenge is how to ensure that mitigation effort and any associated benefits of action are distributed fairly within and between countries and aligned to the overarching objective of global sustainable development. Lastly, globally effective and efficient mitigation will require international cooperation especially in the realms of finance and technology."
wg3_ch01_1.10_p3,NO_TITLE,"Multiple frameworks of analytic assessment, adapted to the realities of climate change mitigation, are therefore required. We identified four main groups. Aggregate economic frameworks – including environmental costs or goals, and with due attention to implied behavioural, distributional and dynamic assumptions – can provide insights about trade-offs, cost-effectiveness and policies for delivering agreed goals. Ethical frameworks are equally essential to inform both international and domestic discourse and decisions, including the relationship with international (and intergenerational) responsibilities, related financial systems, and domestic policy design in all countries. Explicit frameworks for analysing transition and transformation across multiple sectors need to draw on both socio-technical transition literatures, and those on social transformation. Finally, literatures on psychology, behaviour and political sciences can illuminate obstacles that have impeded progress to date and suggest ways to overcome them."
wg3_ch01_1.10_p4,NO_TITLE,"No single analytical framework, or single discipline, on its own can offer a comprehensive assessment of climate change mitigation. Together they point to the relevance of growing literatures and discourses on Just Transitions, and the role of governance at multiple levels. Ultimately all these frameworks are needed to inform the decisions required to deepen and connect the scattered elements of progress to date, and hence accelerate progress towards agreed goals and multiple dimensions of climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable development."
wg3_ch01_1.11_p1,NO_TITLE,"Despite huge expansion in the literature (Callaghan et al. 2020), knowledge gaps remain. Modeling still struggles to bring together detailed physical and economic climate impacts and mitigation, with limited representation of financial and distributional dynamics. There are few interdisciplinary tools which apply theories of transition and transformation to questions of economic and social impacts, compounded by remaining uncertainties concerning the role of new technological sets, international instruments, policy and political evaluation."
wg3_ch01_1.11_p2,NO_TITLE,"One scan of future research needs suggests three priority areas (Roberts et al. 2020): (i) human welfare-focused development (e.g., reducing inequality); (ii) how the historic position of states within international power relations conditions their ability to respond to climate change; (iii) transition dynamics and the flexibility of institutions to drive towards low-carbon development pathways. There remain gaps in understanding how international dynamics and agreements filter down to affect constituencies and local implementation. Literature on the potential for supply-side agreements, in which producers agree to restrict the supply of fossil fuels (e.g., Asheim et al. 2019) is limited but gaining increasing academic attention."
wg3_ch01_1.11_p3,NO_TITLE,"Nature is under pressure both at land and at sea, as demonstrated by declining biodiversity (IPBES 2019). Climate policies could increase the pressure on land and oceans (IPCC 2019c,b), with insufficient attention to relationships between biodiversity and climate agreements and associated policies. IPBES aims to coordinate with the IPCC more directly, but literature will be required to support these reports."
wg3_ch01_1.11_p4,NO_TITLE,"Compounding these gaps is the fact that socially oriented, agriculture-related options, where human and non-human systems intersect most obviously, remain under-researched (e.g., Balasubramanya and Stifel 2020). Efforts to engage with policies here, especially framed around ecosystem services, have often neglected their ‘practical fitness’ in favour of focusing on their ‘institutional fitness’, which needs to be addressed in future research (Stevenson et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch01_1.11_p5,NO_TITLE,"The relative roles of short-term mitigation policies and long-term investments, including government and financial decision-making tools, remains inadequately explored. Strategic investments may include city planning, public transport, EV-charging networks, and CCU/CCS. Understanding how international treaties can increase incentives to make such investments is all the more salient in the aftermath of COVID-19, on which research is necessarily young but rapidly growing. Finally, the economic, institutional and political strategies to close the gap between NDCs, actual implementation, and mitigation goals – informed by the PA and the UNFCCC Global Stocktake – require much further research."
wg3_ch01_1.12_p1,NO_TITLE,"This Sixth Assessment Report covers mitigation in five main parts (Figure 1.9), namely: introduction and frameworks; emission trends, scenarios and pathways; sectors; institutional dimensions including national and international policy, financial and technological mitigation drivers; and conclusions."
wg3_ch01_1.12_p3,NO_TITLE,"Chapters 2 to 5 cover the big picture trends, drivers and projections at national and global levels. Chapter 2 analyses emission trends and drivers to date. Chapter 3 presents long-term global scenarios, including the projected economic and other characteristics of mitigation through to the balancing of sources and sinks through the second half of this century, and the implications for global temperature change and risks. Chapter 4 explores the shorter-term prospects including NDCs, and the possibilities for accelerating mitigation out to 2050 in the context of sustainable development at the national, regional and international scales. Chapter 5, a new chapter for IPCC Assessments, focuses upon the role of services and derived demand for energy and land use, and the social dimensions."
wg3_ch01_1.12_p4,NO_TITLE,"Chapters 6 to 12 examine sectoral contributions and possibilities for mitigation. Chapter 6 summarises characteristics and trends in the energy sector, specifically supply, including the remarkable changes in the cost of some key technologies since AR5. Chapter 7 examines the roles of AFOLU, drawing upon and updating the recent Special Report, including the potential tensions between the multiple uses of land. Chapter 8 presents a holistic view of the trends and pressures of urban systems, as both a challenge and an opportunity for mitigation. Chapters 9 and 10 then examine two sectors which entwine with, but go well beyond, urban systems: buildings (Chapter 9) including construction materials and zero-carbon buildings; and transport (Chapter 10), including shipping and aviation and a wider look at mobility as a general service. Chapter 11 explores the contribution of industry, including supply chain developments, resource efficiency/circular economy, and the cross-system implications of decarbonisation for industrial systems. Finally, Chapter 12 takes a cross-sectoral perspective and explores cross-cutting issues like the interactions of biomass energy, food and land, and carbon dioxide removal."
wg3_ch01_1.12_p5,NO_TITLE,"Four chapters then review thematic issues in implementation and governance of mitigation. Chapter 13 explores national and sub-national policies and institutions, bringing together lessons of policies examined in the sectoral chapters, as well as insights from service and demand-side perspectives (Chapter 5), along with governance approaches and capacity-building, and the role and relationships of sub-national actors. Chapter 14 then considers the roles and status of international cooperation, including the UNFCCC agreements and international institutions, sectoral agreements and multiple forms of international partnerships, and the ethics and governance challenges of solar radiation modification. Chapter 15 explores investment and finance, including current trends, the investment needs for deep decarbonisation, and the complementary roles of public and private finance. This includes climate-related investment opportunities and risks (e.g., ‘stranded assets’), linkages between finance and investments in adaptation and mitigation; and the impact of COVID-19. A new chapter on innovation (Chapter 16) looks at technology development, accelerated deployment and global diffusion as systemic issues that hold potential for transformative changes, and the challenges of managing such changes at multiple levels including the role of international cooperation."
wg3_ch01_1.12_p6,NO_TITLE,"Finally, Chapter 17 considers accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development, including practical pathways for joint responses to climate change and sustainable development challenges. This includes major regional perspectives, mitigation-adaptation interlinkages, and enabling conditions including the roles of technology, finance and cooperation for sustainable development."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.1 | 	What is climate change mitigation?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change mitigation refers to actions or activities that limit emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from entering the atmosphere and/or reduce their levels in the atmosphere. Mitigation includes reducing the GHGs emitted from energy production and use (e.g., that reduces use of fossil fuels), and land use, and methods to mitigate warming, for example, by carbon sinks which remove emissions from the atmosphere through land-use or other (including artificial) mechanisms (Sections 12.3 and 14.4.5; see AR6 WGI for physical science, and WGIII Chapter 7 for AFOLU mitigation)."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.1 | 	What is climate change mitigation?_p2,NO_TITLE,"The ultimate goal of mitigation is to preserve a biosphere which can sustain human civilisation and the complex of ecosystem services which surround and support it. This means reducing anthropogenic GHG emissions towards net zero to limit the warming, with global goals agreed in the Paris Agreement. Effective mitigation strategies require an understanding of mechanisms that underpin release of emissions, and the technical, policy and societal options for influencing these."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.2 | 	Which greenhouse gases (GHGs) are relevant to which sectors?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Anthropogenic GHGs such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases (e.g., hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride) are released from various sources. CO2 makes the largest contribution to global GHG emissions, but some have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes extending to tens of thousands of years, such as F-gases (Chapter 2)."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.2 | 	Which greenhouse gases (GHGs) are relevant to which sectors?_p2,NO_TITLE,"Different combinations of gases are emitted from different activities. The largest source of CO2 is combustion of fossil fuels in energy conversion systems like boilers in electric power plants, engines in aircraft and automobiles, and in cooking and heating within homes and businesses (approximately 64% of emissions, Figure SPM.2). Fossil fuels are also a major source of methane (CH4), the second biggest contributor to global warming. While most GHGs come from fossil fuel combustion, about one quarter comes from land-related activities like agriculture (mainly CH4 and N2O) and deforestation (mainly CO2), with additional emissions from industrial processes (mainly CO2, N2O and F-gases), and municipal waste and wastewater (mainly CH4) (Chapter 2). In addition to these emissions, black carbon – an aerosol that is, for example, emitted during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels – contributes to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, whilst some other short-lived pollutants temporarily cool the surface (IPCC AR6 WGI Section 6.5.4.3)."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.3 | 	What is the difference between ‘net zero emissions’ and ‘carbon neutrality’?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Annex I (Glossary) states that ‘carbon neutrality and net zero CO2 emissions are overlapping concepts’ which ‘can be applied at the global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national)’. At the global scale the terms are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero CO2 typically applies to emissions under direct control or territorial responsibility of the entity reporting them (e.g., a country, district or sector); while carbon neutrality is also applied to firms, commodities and activities (e.g., a service or an event) and generally includes emissions and removals beyond the entity’s direct control or territorial responsibility, termed ‘Scope 3’ or ‘value chain emissions’ (Bhatia et al. 2011)."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.3 | 	What is the difference between ‘net zero emissions’ and ‘carbon neutrality’?_p2,NO_TITLE,"This means the emissions and removals that should be included are wider for ‘neutrality’ than for net zero goals, but also that offset mechanisms could be employed to help achieve neutrality through abatement beyond what is possible under the direct control of the entity. Rules and environmental integrity criteria are intended to ensure additionality and avoid double counting of offsets consistent with ‘neutrality’ claims (see ‘carbon neutrality’ and ‘offset’ in Glossary, for detail and a list of criteria)."
wg3_ch01_FAQ 1.3 | 	What is the difference between ‘net zero emissions’ and ‘carbon neutrality’?_p3,NO_TITLE,"While the term ‘carbon’ neutrality in this report is defined as referring specifically to CO2 neutrality, use of this term in practice can be ambiguous, as some users apply it to neutrality of all GHG emissions. GHG neutrality means an entity’s gross emissions of all GHG must be balanced by the removal of an equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere. This requires the selection of a suitable metric that aggregates emissions from non-CO2 gases, such as the commonly used GWP100 metric (for a discussion of GHG metrics, see AR6 WGI Box 1.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2 of this report)."
