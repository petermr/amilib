wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p1,NO_TITLE,"Innovation in climate mitigation technologies has seen enormous activity and significant progress in recent years. Innovation has also led to, and exacerbated, trade-offs in relation to sustainable development (high confidence). Innovation can leverage action to mitigate climate change by reinforcing other interventions. In conjunction with other enabling conditions, innovation can support system transitions to limit warming and help shift development pathways. The currently widespread implementation of solar photovoltaic (solar PV) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), for instance, could not have happened without technological innovation ( high confidence). Technological innovation can also bring about new and improved ways of delivering services that are essential to human well-being. At the same time as delivering benefits, innovation can result in trade-offs that undermine both progress on mitigation and progress towards other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Trade-offs include negative externalities – for instance, greater environmental pollution and social inequalities – rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased dependency on foreign knowledge and providers ( high confidence). Effective governance and policy has the potential to avoid and minimise such misalignments (medium evidence,  high agreement ). {16.1, <span class=""•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-""></span>16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5.1, 16.6}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p2,NO_TITLE,"A systemic view of innovation to direct and organise the processes has grown over the last decade. This systemic view of innovation takes into account the role of actors, institutions and their interactions, and can inform how innovation systems that vary across technologies, sectors and countries, can be strengthened (high confidence)  . Where a  systemic view of innovation has been taken, it has enabled the development and implementation of indicators that are better able to provide insights into innovation processes. This, in turn, has enabled the analysis and strengthening of innovation systems. Traditional quantitative innovation indicators mainly include research and development (R&D) investments and patents. Systemic indicators of innovation, however, go well beyond these approaches. They include structural innovation system elements including actors and networks, as well as indicators for how innovation systems function, such as access to finance, employment in relevant sectors, and lobbying activities. For example, in Latin America, monitoring systemic innovation indicators for the effectiveness of agroecological mitigation approaches has provided insights on the appropriateness and social alignment of new technologies and practices. Climate-energy-economy models, including integrated assessment models, generally employ a stylised and necessarily incomplete view of innovation, and have yet to incorporate a systemic representation of innovation systems. {16.2, 16.2.4, 16.3, 16.3.4, 16.5, Table 16.7, Box 16.1, Box 16.3, Box 16.10}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p3,NO_TITLE,"A systemic perspective on technological change can provide insights to policymakers supporting their selection of effective innovation policy instruments (high confidence). A combination of scaled-up innovation investments with demand-pull interventions can achieve faster technology unit cost reductions and more rapid scale-up  than either approach in isolation ( high confidence). These innovation policy instruments would nonetheless have to be tailored to local development priorities, to the specific context of different countries, and to the technology being supported. The timing of interventions and any trade-offs with sustainable development also need to be addressed. Public R&D funding and support, as well as innovation procurement, have proven valuable for fostering innovation in small to medium cleantech firms. Innovation outcomes of policy instruments not necessarily aimed at innovation, such as feed-in tariffs, auctions, emissions trading schemes, taxes and renewable portfolio standards, vary from negligible to positive for climate change mitigation. Some specific designs of environmental taxation can also result in negative distributional outcomes. Most of the available literature and evidence on innovation systems come from industrialised countries and larger developing countries. However, there is a growing body of evidence from developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). {16.4, 16.4.4.3, 16.4.4.4, 16.5, 16.7}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p4,NO_TITLE,"Experience and analyses show that technological change is inhibited if technological innovation system functions are not adequately fulfilled. This inhibition occurs more often in developing countries (high confidence). Examples of such functions are knowledge development, resource mobilisation, and activities that shape the needs, requirements and expectations of actors within the innovation system (guidance of the search). Capabilities play a key role in these functions, the build-up of which can be enhanced by domestic measures, but also by international cooperation ( high confidence). For instance, innovation cooperation on wind energy has contributed to the accelerated global spread of this technology. As another example, the policy guidance by the Indian government, which also promoted development of data, testing capabilities and knowledge within the private sector, has been a key determinant of the success of an energy-efficiency programme for air conditioners and refrigerators in India. {16.3, <span class=""•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-""></span>16.5, 16.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter, Box 16.2}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p5,NO_TITLE,"Consistent with innovation system approaches, the sharing of knowledge and experiences between developed and developing countries can contribute to addressing global climate and SDGs. The effectiveness of such international cooperation arrangements, however, depends on the way they are developed and implemented (high confidence). The effectiveness and sustainable development benefits of technology sharing under market conditions appear to be determined primarily by the complexity of technologies, local capabilities and the policy regime. This suggests that the development of planning and innovation capabilities remains necessary, especially in least-developed countries and SIDS. International diffusion of low-emission technologies is also facilitated by knowledge spillovers from regions engaged in clean R&D (medium conf idence). {16.6}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p6,NO_TITLE,"The evidence on the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) in innovation is mixed. Some literature suggests that it is a barrier, while other sources suggest that it is an enabler to the diffusion of climate-related technologies (medium confidence)  . There is agreement that countries with well-developed institutional capacity may benefit from a strengthened IPR regime, but that countries with limited capabilities might face greater barriers to innovation as a consequence. This enhances the continued need for capacity building. Ideas to improve the alignment of the global IPR regime and address climate change include specific arrangements for least-developed countries, case-by-case decision-making and patent-pooling institutions. {16.2.3.3, 16.5, Box 16.9}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p7,NO_TITLE,"Although some initiativeshave mobilised investments in developing countries, gaps in innovation cooperation remain, including in the Paris Agreement instruments. These gaps could be filled by enhancing financial support for international technology cooperation, by strengthening cooperative approaches, and by helping build suitable capacity in developing countries across all technological innovation system functions (high confidence). The implementation of current arrangements of international cooperation for technology development and transfer, as well as capacity building, are insufficient to meet climate objectives and contribute to sustainable development. For example, despite building a large market for mitigation technologies in developing countries, the lack of a systemic perspective in the implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism, operational since the mid-2000s, has only led to some technology transfer, especially to larger developing countries, but limited capacity building and minimal technology development (medium confidence). In the current climate regime, a more systemic approach to innovation cooperation could be introduced by linking technology institutions, such as the Technology Mechanism, and financial actors, such as the financial mechanism. {16.5.3}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p8,NO_TITLE,"Countries are exposed to sustainable development challenges in parallel with the challenges that relate to climate change. Addressing both sets of challenges simultaneously presents multiple and recurrent obstacles that systemic approaches to technological change could help resolve, provided they are well managed (high confidence). Obstacles include both entrenched power relations dominated by vested interests that control and benefit from existing technologies, and governance structures that continue to reproduce unsustainable patterns of production and consumption (medium confidence). Studies also highlight the potential for cultural factors to strongly influence the pace and direction of technological change. Sustainable solutions require adoption and mainstreaming of locally novel technologies that can meet local needs, and simultaneously address the SDGs. Acknowledging the systemic nature of technological innovation, which involves many levels of actors, stages of innovation and scales, can lead to new opportunities to shift development pathways towards sustainability. {16.4, 16.5, 16.6}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p9,NO_TITLE,"An area where sustainable development, climate change mitigation and technological change interact is digitalisation. Digital technologies can promote large increases in energy efficiency through coordination and an economic shift to services, but they can also greatly increase energy demand because of the energy used in digital devices. System-level rebound effects may also occur (high confidence). Digital devices, including servers, increase pressure on the environment due to the demand for rare metals and end-of-life disposal. The absence of adequate governance in many countries can lead to harsh working conditions and unregulated disposal of electronic waste. Digitalisation also affects firms’ competitiveness, the demand for skills, and the distribution of, and access to, resources. The existing digital divide, especially in developing countries, and the lack of appropriate governance of the digital revolution can hamper the role that digitalisation could play in supporting the achievement of stringent mitigation targets. At present, the understanding of both the direct and indirect impacts of digitalisation on energy use, carbon emissions and potential mitigation, is limited (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter, 16.2}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p10,NO_TITLE,"Strategies for climate change mitigation can be most effective in accelerating transformative change when actions taken to strengthen one set of enabling conditions also reinforce and strengthen the effectiveness of other enabling conditions (medium confidence). Applying transition or system dynamics to decisions can help policymakers take advantage of such high-leverage intervention points, address the specific characteristics of technological stages, and respond to societal dynamics. Inspiration can be drawn from the global unit cost reductions of solar PV, which were accelerated by a combination of factors interacting in a mutually reinforcing way across a limited group of countries ( high confidence). {Box 16.4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter}"
wg3_ch16_executive-summary_p11,NO_TITLE,"Better and more comprehensive data on innovation indicators can provide timely insights for policymakers and policy design locally, nationally and internationally, especially for developing countries, where such insights are missing more often. Data needed include those that can show the strength of technological, sectoral and national innovation systems. It is also necessary to validate current results and generate insights from theoretical frameworks and empirical studies for developing countries contexts. Innovation studies on adaptation and mitigation other than energy and ex-post assessments of the effectiveness of various innovation-related policies and interventions, including R&D, would also provide benefits. Furthermore, methodological developments to improve the ability of integrated assessment models (IAMs) to capture energy innovation system dynamics, and the relevant institutions and policies (including design and implementation), would allow for more realistic assessment. {16.2, 16.3, 16.7}"
wg3_ch16_16.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technological change and innovation are considered key drivers of economic growth and social progress (Brandão Santana et al. 2015; Heeks and Stanforth 2015). Increased production and consumption of goods and services creates economic benefits through higher demands for improved technologies (Gossart 2015). Since the Industrial Revolution, however, and notwithstanding the benefits, this production and consumption trend and the technological changes associated with it have also come at the cost of long-term damage to the life support systems of our planet (Alarcón and Vos 2015; Steffen et al. 2015). The significance of such impacts depends on the technology, but also on the intrinsic characteristics of the country or region analysed (Brandão Santana et al. 2015)."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Other chapters in this volume have discussed technological change in various ways, including as a framing issue (Chapter 1), in the context of specific sectors (Chapters 6–11), for specific purposes (Chapter 12) and as a matter of policy, international cooperation and finance (Chapters 13–15). Chapter 2 discusses past trends in technological change and chapters 3 and 4 discuss it in the context of future modelling. In general, implicitly or explicitly, technological change is assigned an important role in climate change mitigation and achieving sustainable development (Thacker et al. 2019), as also discussed in past IPCC reports (IPCC 2014, 2018a). Chapter 16 describes how a well-established innovation system at a national level, guided by well-designed policies, can contribute to achieving mitigation and adaptation targets along with broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while avoiding undesired consequences of technological change."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The environmental impacts of social and economic activities, including emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), are greatly influenced by the rate and direction of technological changes (Jaffe et al. 2000). Technological changes usually designed and used to increase productivity and reduce the use of natural resources can lead to increased production and consumption of goods and services through different rebound effects that diminish the potential benefits of reducing the pressure on the environment (Kemp and Soete 1990; Grübler 1998; Sorrell 2007; Barker et al. 2009; Gossart 2015)."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Those environmental impacts depend not only on which technologies are used, but also on how they are used (Grübler et al. 1999a). Technological change is not exogenous to social and economic systems; technologies are not conceived, selected, and applied autonomously (Grubler et al. 2018). Underlying driving forces of the problem, such as more resource-intensive lifestyles and larger populations (Hertwich and Peters 2009; UNEP 2014), remain largely unchallenged. Comprehensive knowledge of the direct and indirect effects of technological changes on physical and social systems could improve decision-making, including in those cases where technological change mitigates environmental impacts."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"A sustainable global future for people and nature requires rapid and transformative societal change by integrating technical, governance (including participation), financial and societal aspects of the solutions to be implemented (Sachs et al. 2019; Pörtner et al. 2021). A growing body of interdisciplinary research from around the world can inform implementation of adaptive solutions that address the benefits and drawbacks of linkages in social-ecological complexity, including externalities and rebound effects from innovation and technological transformation (Balvanera et al. 2017; Pörtner et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p6,NO_TITLE,Technological change and transitional knowledge can reinforce each other. The value of traditional wisdom and its technological practices provide examples of sustainable and adaptive systems that could potentially adapt to and mitigate climate change (Kuoljok 2019; Singh et al. 2020). Peasants and traditional farmers have been able to respond well to climate changes through their wisdom and traditional practices (Nicholls and Alteri 2013). The integration of the traditional wisdom with new technologies can offer new and effective solutions (Galloway McLean 2010).
wg3_ch16_16.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Achieving climate change mitigation and other SDGs thus also requires rapid diffusion of knowledge and technological innovations. However, these are hampered by various barriers, some of which are illustrated in Table 16.1 (Markard et al. 2020)."

wg3_ch16_16.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"The literature has been growing rapidly over the past decades on how, in a systemic way, the barriers to sustainability transition can be overcome in various circumstances. A central element is that national systems of innovation can help achieve both climate change goals and SDGs, by integrating new ideas, devices, resources, new and traditional knowledge, and technological changes for more effective and adaptive solutions (Lundvall 1992). At the organisational level, innovation is seen as a process that can bring value by means of creating more effective products, services, processes, technologies, policies and business models that are applicable to commercial, business, financial and even societal or political organisations (Brooks 1980; Arthur 2009)."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"The literature refers to the terms ‘technology push‘, ‘market pull‘, ‘regulatory push-pull‘, and ‘firm specific factors‘ as drivers for innovation, mostly to inform policymakers (Zubeltzu-Jaka et al. 2018). There has also been growing interest in social drivers, motivated by the recognition of social issues, such as unemployment and public health, linked to the deployment of innovative low-carbon technologies (Altantsetseg et al. 2020). Policy and social factors and the diverse trajectories of innovation are influenced by regional and national conditions (Tariq et al. 2017), and such local needs and purposes need to be considered in crafting international policies aimed at fostering the global transition towards increased sustainability (Caravella and Crespi 2020). From this standpoint, a multidimensional, multi-actor, systemic innovation approach would be needed to enhance global innovation diffusion (de Jesus and Mendonça 2018), especially if this is to lead to overall sustainability improvements rather than result in new sustainability challenges."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p12,NO_TITLE,"Policies to mitigate climate change do not always take into account the effects of mitigation technologies on other environmental and social challenges (Arvesen et al. 2011). Policies also often disregard the strong linkages between technological innovation and social innovation; the latter is understood to be the use of soft technologies that brings about transformation through establishing new institutions, new practices, and new models to create a positive societal impact, characterised by collaboration that crosses traditional roles and boundaries, between citizens, civil society, the state, and the private sector (Reynolds et al. 2017). Market forces do not provide sufficient incentives for investment in development or diffusion of technologies, leaving a role for public policy to create the conditions to assure a systemic innovation approach (Popp 2010; Popp and Newell 2012). Moreover, public action is more than just addressing market failure, it is an unalienable element of an innovation system (Mazzucato 2013)."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p13,NO_TITLE,"Coupling technological innovation with sustainable development and the SDGs would need to address overall social, environmental, and economic consequences, given that public policy is intertwined with innovation, technological changes and other factors in a complex manner.

wg3_ch16_16.1_p14,NO_TITLE,"Section 16.2 discusses drivers of innovation process, including macro factors that can redirect technological change towards low-carbon options. Representations of these drivers in mathematical and statistical models allow for explaining the past and constructing projections of future technological change. They also integrate the analysis of drivers and consequences of technological change within economic-energy-economy (or integrated assessment) models (Chapter 3). The section also describes the different phases of innovation and metrics, such as the widely used but also criticised technology readiness levels (TRLs)."
wg3_ch16_16.1_p15,NO_TITLE,"Section 16.3 discusses innovation as a systemic process based on recent literature. While the innovation process is often stylised as a linear process, innovation is now predominantly seen as a systemic process in that it is a result of actions by, and interactions among, a large set of actors, whose activities are shaped by, and shape, the context in which they operate and the user group with which they are engaging."

The distinction between stages of the innovation process allows for assessment of technology readiness (Section 16.2.1). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the main elements underpinning innovation – research and development (R&D), learning by doing, and spillovers – allows for an explanation of past and projected future technological changes (Section 16.2.2). In addition, general purpose technologies can play a role in climate change mitigation."
wg3_ch16_16.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"In the context of mitigation pathways, the feasibility of any emission reduction targets depends on the ability to promote innovation in low- and zero-carbon technologies, as opposed to any other technology. For this reason, Section 16.2.3 reviews the literature of the levers influencing the direction of technological change in favour of low- and zero-carbon technologies. Moreover, representation of drivers in mathematical and statistical models from Section 16.2.2 allows integration of its analysis with economic and climate effects within integrated assessment models (IAMs), hence permitting more precise modelling of decarbonisation pathways (Section 16.2.4)."
wg3_ch16_16.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In addition to technological innovation, other innovation approaches are relevant in the context of climate mitigation and more broadly sustainable development (Section 16.6). Frugal innovations, that is, ‘good enough‘ innovations that fulfil the needs of non-affluent consumers mostly in developing countries (Hossain 2018), are characterised by low costs, concentration on core functionalities, and optimised performance level (Weyrauch and Herstatt 2016) and are hence often associated with (ecological and social) sustainability (Albert 2019). Grassroots innovations are products, services and processes developed to address specific local challenges and opportunities, and which can generate novel, bottom-up solutions responding to local situations, interests and values. (Pellicer-Sifres et al. 2018; Dana et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1_p1,Research and Development ,"The innovation cycle is commonly thought of as having three distinct innovation phases on the path between basic research and commercial application: Research and development (R&D); demonstration; and deployment and diffusion (IPCC 2007). Each of these phases differs with respect to the kind of activity carried out, the type of actors involved and their roles, financing needs, and the associated risks and uncertainties. All phases involve a process of trial and error, and failure is common; the share of innovation that successfully reaches the deployment phase is small. The path occurring between basic research and commercialisation is not linear (Section 16.3); it often requires a long time and is characterised by significant bottlenecks and roadblocks. Furthermore, technologies may regress in the innovation cycle, rather than move forward (Skea et al. 2019). Successfully passing from each stage to the next one in the innovation cycle requires overcoming ‘valleys of deaths’ (Auerswald and Branscomb 2003; UNFCCC 2017), most notably the demonstration phase (Frank et al. 1996; Weyant 2011; Nemet et al. 2018). Over time, new and improved technologies are discovered; this often makes the dominant technology obsolete, but this is not discussed in this report."

wg3_ch16_16.2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This phase of the innovation process focuses on generating knowledge or solving particular problems by creating a combination of artefacts to perform a particular function, or to achieve a specific goal. R&D activities comprise basic research, applied research and technology development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge, primarily directed towards a specific, practical aim or objective (OECD 2015a). Importantly, R&D activities can be incremental – that is, focused on addressing a specific need by marginally improving an existing technology – or radical, representing a paradigm shift, promoted by new opportunities arising with the accumulation of new knowledge (Mendonça et al. 2018). Technology development, often leading to prototyping, consists of generating a working model of the technology that is usable in the real world, proving the usability and customer desirability of the technology, and giving an idea of its design, features and function (OECD 2015a). These early stages of technological innovation are referred to as the ‘formative phase’, during which the conditions are shaped for a technology to emerge and become established in the market (Wilson and Grubler 2013) and the constitutive elements of the innovation system emerging around a particular technology are set up (Bento and Wilson 2016; Bento et al. 2018) (Section 16.3)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The outcomes of R&D are uncertain: the amount of knowledge that will result from any given research project or investment is unknown ex ante (Rosenberg 1998). This risk to funders (Goldstein and Kearney 2020) translates into underinvestment in R&D due to low appropriability (Weyant 2011; Sagar and Majumdar 2014). In the case of climate mitigation technologies, low innovation incentives for the private sector also result from a negative environmental externality (Jaffe et al. 2005). Furthermore, in the absence of stringent climate policies and targets, incumbent fossil-based energy technologies are characterised by lower financing risk, are heavily subsidised (Davis 2014; Kotchen 2021), and depreciate slowly (Arrow 1962a; Nanda et al. 2016; Semieniuk et al. 2021) (Section 16.2.3). In this context, public research funding plays a key role in supporting high-risk R&D, both in developed and developing economies: it can provide patient and steady funding not tied to short-term investment returns (Kammen and Nemet 2007; Anadon et al. 2014; Mazzucato 2015a; Chan and Diaz Anadon 2016; Anadón et al. 2017; Howell 2017; Zhang et al. 2019) (Section 16.4). Public policies also play a role in increasing private incentives in energy research and development funding (Nemet 2013). R&D statistics are an important indicator of innovation and are collected following the rules of the Frascati Manual (OECD 2015a) (Section 16.3.3, Box 16.3 and Table 16.7)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Demonstration is carried out through pilot projects or large-scale testing in the real world. Successfully demonstrating a technology shows its utility and that it is able to achieve its intended purpose and, consequently, that the risk of failure is reduced (i.e., that it has market potential) (Hellsmark et al. 2016). Demonstration projects are an important step to promote the deployment of low-carbon energy and industrial technologies in the context of the transition. Government funding often plays a large role in energy technology demonstration projects because scaling up hardware energy technologies is expensive and risky (Brown and Hendry 2009; Hellsmark et al. 2016). Governments’ engagement in low-carbon technology demonstration also signals support for businesses willing to take the investment risk (Mazzucato 2016). Venture capital, traditionally not tailored for energy investment, can also play an increasingly important role, thanks to the incentives (e.g., through de-risking) provided by public funding and policies (Gaddy et al. 2017; IEA 2017a)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Deployment entails producing a technology at large scale and scaling up its adoption and use across individual firms or households in a given market, and across different markets (Jaffe 2015). In the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies, the purposeful diffusion to developing countries, is referred to as ‘technology transfer’. Most recently, the term ‘innovation cooperation’ has been proposed to indicate that technologies needs to be co-developed and adapted to local contexts (Pandey et al. 2021). Innovation cooperation is an important component of stringent mitigation strategies as well as international agreements (Section 16.5)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Diffusion is often sluggish due to lock-in of dominant technologies (Liebowitz and Margolis 1995; Unruh 2000; Ivanova et al. 2018), as well as the time needed to diffuse information about the technologies, heterogeneity among adopters, the incentive to wait until costs fall even further, the presence of behavioural and institutional barriers, and the uncertainty surrounding mitigation policies and long-term commitments to climate targets (Gillingham and Sweeney 2012; Corey 2014; Jaffe 2015; Haelg et al. 2018). In addition, novel technology has been hindered by the actions of powerful incumbents who accrue economic and political advantages over time, as in the case of renewable energy generation (Unruh 2002; Supran and Oreskes 2017; Hoppmann et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Technologies have been shown to penetrate the market with a gradual non-linear process in a characteristic logistic (S-shaped) curve (Grübler 1996; Rogers 2003). The time needed to reach widespread adoption varies greatly across technologies relevant for adaptation and mitigation (Gross et al. 2018); in the case of energy technologies, the time needed for technologies to get from a 10–90% market share of saturation ranges between 5 to over 70 years (Wilson 2012). Investment in commercialisation of low-emission technology is largely provided by private financiers; however, governments play a key role in ensuring incentives through supportive policies, including R&D expenditures providing signals to private investors (Haelg et al. 2018), pricing carbon dioxide emissions, public procurement, technology standards, information diffusion and the regulation for end-lifecycle treatment of products ( Cross and Murray 2018) (Section 16.4)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technology readiness levels (TRLs) are a categorisation that enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. They were developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s (Mankins 1995, 2009) and originally used to describe the readiness of components forming part of a technological system. Over time, more classifications of TRLs have been introduced, notably the one used by the European Union (EU). Most recently, the International Energy Agency (IEA) extended previous classifications to include the later stages of the innovation process (IEA 2020b) and applied it to compare the market readiness of clean energy technologies and their components (OECD 2015a; IEA 2020b). TRLs are currently widely used by engineers, business people, research funders and investors, often to assess the readiness of whole technologies rather than single components. To determine a TRL for a given technology, a technology readiness assessment (TRA) is carried out to examine programme concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities. In the most recent version of the IEA (IEA 2020b), TRLs range from 1 to 11, with 11 indicating the most mature (Table 16.2)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"The purpose of TRLs is to support decision-making. They are applied to avoid the premature application of technologies, which would lead to increased costs and project schedule extensions (US Department of Energy 2011).

Many of these limitations can be eased by using TRLs in combination with other indicators such as system readiness levels and other economic indicators on, for example, investments and returns (IEA 2020b)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This phase of the innovation process focuses on generating knowledge or solving particular problems by creating a combination of artefacts to perform a particular function, or to achieve a specific goal. R&D activities comprise basic research, applied research and technology development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge, primarily directed towards a specific, practical aim or objective (OECD 2015a). Importantly, R&D activities can be incremental – that is, focused on addressing a specific need by marginally improving an existing technology – or radical, representing a paradigm shift, promoted by new opportunities arising with the accumulation of new knowledge (Mendonça et al. 2018). Technology development, often leading to prototyping, consists of generating a working model of the technology that is usable in the real world, proving the usability and customer desirability of the technology, and giving an idea of its design, features and function (OECD 2015a). These early stages of technological innovation are referred to as the ‘formative phase’, during which the conditions are shaped for a technology to emerge and become established in the market (Wilson and Grubler 2013) and the constitutive elements of the innovation system emerging around a particular technology are set up (Bento and Wilson 2016; Bento et al. 2018) (Section 16.3)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The outcomes of R&D are uncertain: the amount of knowledge that will result from any given research project or investment is unknown ex ante (Rosenberg 1998). This risk to funders (Goldstein and Kearney 2020) translates into underinvestment in R&D due to low appropriability (Weyant 2011; Sagar and Majumdar 2014). In the case of climate mitigation technologies, low innovation incentives for the private sector also result from a negative environmental externality (Jaffe et al. 2005). Furthermore, in the absence of stringent climate policies and targets, incumbent fossil-based energy technologies are characterised by lower financing risk, are heavily subsidised (Davis 2014; Kotchen 2021), and depreciate slowly (Arrow 1962a; Nanda et al. 2016; Semieniuk et al. 2021) (Section 16.2.3). In this context, public research funding plays a key role in supporting high-risk R&D, both in developed and developing economies: it can provide patient and steady funding not tied to short-term investment returns (Kammen and Nemet 2007; Anadon et al. 2014; Mazzucato 2015a; Chan and Diaz Anadon 2016; Anadón et al. 2017; Howell 2017; Zhang et al. 2019) (Section 16.4). Public policies also play a role in increasing private incentives in energy research and development funding (Nemet 2013). R&D statistics are an important indicator of innovation and are collected following the rules of the Frascati Manual (OECD 2015a) (Section 16.3.3, Box 16.3 and Table 16.7)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Demonstration is carried out through pilot projects or large-scale testing in the real world. Successfully demonstrating a technology shows its utility and that it is able to achieve its intended purpose and, consequently, that the risk of failure is reduced (i.e., that it has market potential) (Hellsmark et al. 2016). Demonstration projects are an important step to promote the deployment of low-carbon energy and industrial technologies in the context of the transition. Government funding often plays a large role in energy technology demonstration projects because scaling up hardware energy technologies is expensive and risky (Brown and Hendry 2009; Hellsmark et al. 2016). Governments’ engagement in low-carbon technology demonstration also signals support for businesses willing to take the investment risk (Mazzucato 2016). Venture capital, traditionally not tailored for energy investment, can also play an increasingly important role, thanks to the incentives (e.g., through de-risking) provided by public funding and policies (Gaddy et al. 2017; IEA 2017a)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Deployment entails producing a technology at large scale and scaling up its adoption and use across individual firms or households in a given market, and across different markets (Jaffe 2015). In the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies, the purposeful diffusion to developing countries, is referred to as ‘technology transfer’. Most recently, the term ‘innovation cooperation’ has been proposed to indicate that technologies needs to be co-developed and adapted to local contexts (Pandey et al. 2021). Innovation cooperation is an important component of stringent mitigation strategies as well as international agreements (Section 16.5)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Diffusion is often sluggish due to lock-in of dominant technologies (Liebowitz and Margolis 1995; Unruh 2000; Ivanova et al. 2018), as well as the time needed to diffuse information about the technologies, heterogeneity among adopters, the incentive to wait until costs fall even further, the presence of behavioural and institutional barriers, and the uncertainty surrounding mitigation policies and long-term commitments to climate targets (Gillingham and Sweeney 2012; Corey 2014; Jaffe 2015; Haelg et al. 2018). In addition, novel technology has been hindered by the actions of powerful incumbents who accrue economic and political advantages over time, as in the case of renewable energy generation (Unruh 2002; Supran and Oreskes 2017; Hoppmann et al. 2019)."

The time needed to reach widespread adoption varies greatly across technologies relevant for adaptation and mitigation (Gross et al. 2018); in the case of energy technologies, the time needed for technologies to get from a 10–90% market share of saturation ranges between 5 to over 70 years (Wilson 2012). Investment in commercialisation of low-emission technology is largely provided by private financiers; however, governments play a key role in ensuring incentives through supportive policies, including R&D expenditures providing signals to private investors (Haelg et al. 2018), pricing carbon dioxide emissions, public procurement, technology standards, information diffusion and the regulation for end-lifecycle treatment of products ( Cross and Murray 2018) (Section 16.4)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technology readiness levels (TRLs) are a categorisation that enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. They were developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s (Mankins 1995, 2009) and originally used to describe the readiness of components forming part of a technological system. Over time, more classifications of TRLs have been introduced, notably the one used by the European Union (EU). Most recently, the International Energy Agency (IEA) extended previous classifications to include the later stages of the innovation process (IEA 2020b) and applied it to compare the market readiness of clean energy technologies and their components (OECD 2015a; IEA 2020b). TRLs are currently widely used by engineers, business people, research funders and investors, often to assess the readiness of whole technologies rather than single components. To determine a TRL for a given technology, a technology readiness assessment (TRA) is carried out to examine programme concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities. In the most recent version of the IEA (IEA 2020b), TRLs range from 1 to 11, with 11 indicating the most mature (Table 16.2)."

Learning by doing is the interaction of workers with new machines or processes that allows more efficient use (Arrow 1962b). R&D effort is dedicated to looking for new solutions (e.g., blueprints) that could increase the efficiency of existing production methods or result in entirely new methods, products or services (Section 16.2.1.1)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Learning by doing and R&D are interdependent. Young (1993) postulates that learning by doing cannot continue forever without R&D because it is bounded by an upper physical productivity limit of an existing technology. R&D can shift this limit because it allows for replacing the existing technology with a new one. On the other hand, incentives to invest in R&D depend on the future cost of manufacturing, which in turn depends on the scale of learning by doing. The empirical evidence for virtuous circle between cost reduction, market growth and R&D were found in the case of the photovoltaic (PV) market (Watanabe et al. 2000) (Box 16.4), but could also lead to path dependency and lock-in (Erickson et al. 2015). Sections 16.4.4 and 13.7.3.1 discuss how simultaneous use of technology push and pull policies could amplify the effects of research and learning."
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The benefits of R&D and learning by doing are larger at the economy level than at the firm level (Arrow 1962b; Romer 1990;). As a result, when left to its own, the market tends to generate less investment than socially optimal. For instance, if the cost of a technology is too high before a large amount of learning by doing has occurred, there is a risk that it will not be adopted by the market, even if it is economically advantageous for the society. Indeed, initially new technologies are often expensive and cannot compete with the incumbent technologies (Cowan 1990). Large numbers of adopters could lower this cost via learning by doing to a level sufficient to beat the incumbent technology (Gruebler et al. 2012). However, firms could hesitate to be the first adopter and bear the high cost (Isoard and Soria 2001). If this disadvantage overwhelms the advantages of being a first mover 1  and if adopters are not able to coordinate, it will lead to situation of a lock-in (Gruebler et al. 2012)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,The failure of markets to deliver the size of R&D investment and learning by doing that would be socially optimal is one of the justifications of government intervention.

wg3_ch16_16.2.2.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"The size of the learning-by-doing effect is quantified in literature using learning rates, that is estimates of negative correlation between costs and size of deployment of technologies. The results from this literature include estimates for energy technologies (McDonald and Schrattenholzer 2001), electricity generation technologies (Rubin et al. 2015; Samadi 2018), for storage (Schmidt 2017), for end-of-pipe control (Kang et al. 2020) and for energy demand and energy supply technologies (Weiss et al. 2010). Meta-analyses find that learning rates vary across technologies, within technologies, and over time (Nemet 2009a; Rubin et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2017). Moreover, different components of one technology have different learning rates (Elshurafa et al. 2018). Central tendencies are around 20% cost reduction for each doubling of deployment (McDonald and Schrattenholzer 2001)."

Once those other factors are accounted for, some empirical studies find that the role of learning by doing in driving down the costs becomes minor (Nemet 2006; Kavlak et al. 2018). In addition, the relation could reflect reverse causality: increase in deployment could be an effect (and not a cause) of a drop in price (Nordhaus 2014; Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2015). Nevertheless, in some applications, learning curves can be a useful proxy and heuristic (Nagy et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"The negative relation between costs and experience is a reason to invest in a narrow set of technologies; the uncertainty regarding the parameters of this relation is the reason to invest in wider ranges of technologies (Fleming and Sorenson 2001; Way et al. 2019). Concentrating investment in narrow sets of technologies (specialisation) enables fast accumulation of experience for these technologies and large cost reductions. However, when the potency of technology is uncertain, one does not know which technology is truly optimal in the long run. The narrower the set, the higher the risk that the optimal technology will not be supported, and hence will not benefit from learning by doing. Widening the set of supported technologies would reduce this risk (Way et al. 2019). Uncertainty is present because noise in historical data hides the true value of learning rates, and due to unanticipated future shocks to technology costs (Lafond et al. 2018). Ignoring uncertainty in integrated assessment models implies that these model results are biased towards supporting a narrow set of technologies, neglecting the benefits of decreasing risk through diversification (Sawulski and Witajewski-Baltvilks 2020)."

The constant growth of knowledge stock through spillovers translates into constant growth of productivity and cost reduction."

Recombinant innovations speed up technological change by combining different technological solutions, and make things happen that would be impossible with only incremental innovations (van den Bergh 2008; Safarzyńska and van den Bergh 2010; Frenken et al. 2012). It has been shown that 77% of all patents granted between 1790 and 2010 in the USA are coded by a combination of at least two technology codes (Youn et al. 2015). Spillovers related to energy and low-carbon technologies have been documented by a number of empirical studies ( high confidence) (Popp 2002; Verdolini and Galeotti 2011; Aghion et al. 2016; Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2017; Conti et al. 2018).

Continuous technological change of carbon-intensive industry raises the bar for clean technologies: a larger drop in clean technologies’ cost is necessary to become competitive (Acemoglu et al. 2012; Aghion et al. 2016). The implication is that delaying climate policy increases the cost of that policy (Aghion 2019).
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"On the other hand, the spillover effect associated with innovation in low-emission technologies increases the potency of climate policy (Aghion 2019). For instance, a policy that encourages clean innovation leads to accumulation of knowledge in clean industry which, through spillover effects, encourages further innovation in clean industries. Once the stock of knowledge is sufficiently large, the value of clean industries will be so high that technology firms will invest there, even without policy incentives. Once this point is reached, the policy intervention can be discontinued (Acemoglu et al. 2012)."

For instance, in the presence of spillovers, a carbon tax that incentivises clean technological change increases the competitiveness of clean technologies not only locally, but also abroad. The size of this effect depends on the size of the spillovers. If they are sufficiently strong, the reduction of emissions abroad due to clean technological change could be larger than the increase of emissions due to carbon leakage (Gerlagh and Kuik 2014). Different types of carbon leakage are discussed in Chapter 13, Section 13.7.1, and other consequences of spillovers for the design of policy are discussed in Chapter 13, Section 13.7.3."

The implication is that delaying climate policy increases the cost of that policy (Aghion 2019).
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"On the other hand, the spillover effect associated with innovation in low-emission technologies increases the potency of climate policy (Aghion 2019). For instance, a policy that encourages clean innovation leads to accumulation of knowledge in clean industry which, through spillover effects, encourages further innovation in clean industries. Once the stock of knowledge is sufficiently large, the value of clean industries will be so high that technology firms will invest there, even without policy incentives. Once this point is reached, the policy intervention can be discontinued (Acemoglu et al. 2012)."

For instance, in the presence of spillovers, a carbon tax that incentivises clean technological change increases the competitiveness of clean technologies not only locally, but also abroad. The size of this effect depends on the size of the spillovers. If they are sufficiently strong, the reduction of emissions abroad due to clean technological change could be larger than the increase of emissions due to carbon leakage (Gerlagh and Kuik 2014). Different types of carbon leakage are discussed in Chapter 13, Section 13.7.1, and other consequences of spillovers for the design of policy are discussed in Chapter 13, Section 13.7.3."

Assessing the environmental, social and economic implications of such technologies, including increased emissions through energy use, is challenging (Section 5.3.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several GPTs relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation emerged as a result of digitalisation, namely the adoption or increase in the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by citizens, organisations, industries or countries, and the associated restructuring of several domains of social life and of the economy around digital technologies and infrastructures (Brennen and Kreiss 2016; IEA 2017b). The digital revolution is underpinned by innovation in key technologies, for example, ubiquitous connected consumer devices such as mobile phones (Grubler et al. 2018), rapid expansions of global internet infrastructure and access (World Bank 2014), and steep cost reductions and performance improvements in computing devices, sensors, and digital communication technologies (Verma et al. 2020).

In industrial sectors, robotisation, smart manufacturing (SM), internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and additive manufacturing (AM or 3D printing) have the potential to reduce material demand and promote energy management (Section 11.3.4.2). Smart mobility is changing transport demand and efficiency (Section 10.2.3). Smart devices in buildings, the deployment of smart grids and the provision of renewable energy increase the role of demand-side management (Serrenho and Bertoldi 2019) (Sections 9.4 and 9.5), and support the shift away from asset redundancy (Section 6.4.3). Digital solutions are equally important on the supply side, for example, by accelerating innovation with simulations and deep learning (Rolnick et al. 2021) or realising flexible and decentralised opportunities through energy-as-a-service concepts and particularly with pay-as-you-go (Section 15.6.8)."

Studies cutting across a wide range of industrial sectors (not just energy) have tried to relate cost reductions to different functional forms, including cost reductions as a function of time (Moore’s law) and cost reductions as a function of production or deployment (Wright’s law, also known as Henderson’s law), finding that those two forms perform better than alternatives combining different factors, with costs as a function of production (Wright’s law) performing marginally better (Nagy et al. 2013). A comparison of expert elicitation and model-based forecasts of the future cost of technologies for the energy transition indicates that model-based forecast medians were closer to the average realised values in 2019 (Meng et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Recent studies attempt to separate the influence of learning by doing (which is a basis of Wright’s law) versus other factors in explaining cost reductions, specifically in energy technologies. Some studies explain cost reductions with two factors: cumulative deployment (as proxy for experience); and R&D investment – see the ‘two factor’ learning curve (Klaassen et al. 2005). However, reliable information on public energy R&D investments for developing countries is not systematically collected. Available data for OECD countries cannot be precisely assigned to specific industrial sectors or sub-technologies (Verdolini et al. 2018). Some learning-curve studies take into account that historical variation in technology costs could be explained by variation in key materials and fuel costs – for example, steel costs for wind turbines (Qiu and Anadon 2012), silicon costs (Nemet 2006; Kavlak et al. 2018) as well as coal and coal plant construction costs (McNerney et al. 2011). Economies of scale played a significant role in the PV cost reductions since the early 2000s (Yu et al. 2011) (Box 16.4), which can also become the case in organic PV technologies (Gambhir et al. 2016; Kavlak et al. 2018)."

This view, however, ignores the potency of technological change to alter the otherwise fixed relation between economic growth and the use of resources."

Saving of fossils could be obtained with increasing efficiency of producing alternatives to fossils (Acemoglu et al. 2012, 2014). This is the case of oil consumption by combustion engine cars which could be substituted with electric cars (Aghion et al. 2016). If there is no close substitute for a ‘dirty resource’, then its intensity in production could still be reduced by increasing the efficiency of the dirty resource relative to the efficiency of other inputs (Hassler et al. 2012; André and Smulders 2014; Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2017).

The application of two-factor learning curves to model energy technology costs is often constrained by the lack of information on public and/or private energy R&D investments in many fast-developing and developing countries (Verdolini et al. 2018). The approach used to model energy technology cost reductions varies across technologies, even within the same model, depending on the availability of data and/or the level of maturity.

wg3_ch16_16.2.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Assumptions on energy technology cost developments is one of the factors that determine the speed and magnitude of the deployment in climate-energy-economy models. The modelling is informed by the empirical literature that estimates the rates of cost reduction for energy technologies. A first strand of literature relies on the extrapolation of historical data, assuming that costs decrease either as a power law of cumulative production, exponentially with time (Nagy et al. 2013) or as a function of technical performance metrics (Koh and Magee 2008). Another approach relies on expert estimates of how future costs will evolve, including expert elicitations (Verdolini et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch16_16.2.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"In these models, technology costs may evolve exogenously or endogenously (Mercure et al. 2016; Krey et al. 2019). In the first case, technology costs are assumed to vary over time at some predefined rate, generally extrapolated from past observed patterns or based on expert estimates. This formulation of cost dynamics generally underestimates future costs (Meng et al. 2021) as, among other things, it does not capture any policy-induced carbon-saving technological change or any spillover arising from the accumulation of national and international knowledge (Sections 16.2.2 and 16.2.3) or positive macroeconomic effects of a transition (Karkatsoulis et al. 2016). The influence of cost and diffusion assumptions may be evaluated through sensitivity analysis. In the second case, costs are a function of a choice variable within the model. For instance, technology costs decrease as a function of either cumulative installed capacity (learning by doing) (Seebregts et al. 1998; Kypreos and Bahn 2003) or R&D investments or spillovers from other sectors and countries."

The application of two-factor learning curves to model energy technology costs is often constrained by the lack of information on public and/or private energy R&D investments in many fast-developing and developing countries (Verdolini et al. 2018). The approach used to model energy technology cost reductions varies across technologies, even within the same model, depending on the availability of data and/or the level of maturity. Less mature technologies generally depend highly on learning by research, whereas learning by doing dominates in more mature technologies (Jamasb 2007)."

In other cases, the distribution of many innovation processes are highly internationalised and therefore outside specific territorial boundaries (Binz and Truffer 2017).

A key point of MLP is that new technologies need to establish themselves in a stable ‘socio-technical regime’ and are therefore generally at a disadvantage, not just because of their low technological maturity, but also because of an unwelcoming system. The MLP highlights that the uptake of technologies in society is an evolutionary process, which can be best understood as a combination of ‘variation, selection and retention’ as well as ‘unfolding and reconfiguration’ (Geels 2002). Thus, new technologies in their early stages need to be selected and supported at the micro-level by niche markets, possibly through a directed process that has been termed ‘strategic niche management’ (Kemp et al. 1998). As, at the landscape level, pressures on incumbent regimes mount, and those regimes destabilise, the niche technologies get a chance to get established in a new socio-technical regime. This allows these technologies to grow and stabilise, shaping a changed or sometimes radically renewed socio-technical regime. The MLP takes a systematic and comprehensive view about how to nurture and shape technological transitions by understanding them as evolutionary, multidirectional and cumulative socio-technical processes playing out at multiple levels over time, with a concomitant expansion in the scale and scope of the transition (Elzen et al. 2004; Geels 2005). There have been numerous studies that draw on the MLP to understand different aspects of climate technology innovation and diffusion (van Bree et al. 2010; Geels 2012; Geels et al. 2017)."

Also, a second main traditional perspective on innovation policy was focused on correcting for ‘market failures’ (Weber and Truffer 2017) (Section 16.2). The more recent understanding of, and shift of focus to, the systemic nature on the innovation and diffusion of technologies has implications for innovation policy, since innovation outcomes depend not just on inputs such as R&D, but much more on the functioning of the overall innovation system (see Sections 16.3.1 and 16.4). Policies can therefore be directed at innovation systems components and processes that need the greatest attention or support. This may include, for example, strengthening the capabilities of weak actors and improving interactions between actors (Jacobsson et al. 2017; Weber and Truffer 2017). At the same time, a systemic perspective also brings into sharp relief the notion of ‘system failures’ (Weber and Truffer 2017)."

Most of the literature that unpacks such failures and explores ways to overcome them is on energy-related innovation policy. For example, Table 16.6 summarises a meta-study (Negro et al. 2012) that examined cases of renewable energy technologies trying to disrupt incumbents across a range of countries to understand the roles, and relative importance, of the ‘systemic problems’ highlighted in Section 16.3.1."

An illustration of how such systemic failures have been addressed is given in Box 16.2, which shows how the Indian government designed its standards and labelling programme for energy-efficient air conditioners and refrigerators.

This is partly because of the successes of specialised R&D efforts (Freeman 1995), the predominant linear model of innovation, and because such measures can (relatively) easily be obtained and compared. In the realm of energy-related innovation, RD&D investments remain the single most-used indicator to measure inputs into the innovation process (Box 16.3). Patent counts are a widely used indicator of the outputs of the innovation process, especially because they are detailed enough to provide information on specific adaptation and mitigation technologies. Mitigation and adaptation technologies have their own classification (Y02) with the European Patent Office (EPO) (Veefkind et al. 2012; Angelucci et al. 2018), which can be complemented with keyword search and manual inspection (Persoon et al. 2020; Surana et al. 2020b). However, using energy-related patents as an indicator of innovative activities is complicated by several issues (de Rassenfosse et al. 2013; Haščič and Migotto 2015; Jaffe and de Rassenfosse 2017), including the fact that the scope of what are considered climate mitigation inventions is not always clear or straightforward."

Overall, evidence shows that some of the industrial sectors that are important for meeting climate goals (electricity, agriculture and forestry, mining, oil and gas, and other energy-intensive industrial sectors) are investing relatively small fractions of sales on R&D (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Jasmab and Pollitt 2005; Jamasb and Pollitt 2008; Sanyal and Cohen 2009; European Commission 2015; American Energy Innovation Council 2017; Gaddy et al. 2017; National Science Board 2018)."

The current VC model and other private finance do not sufficiently cover the need to demonstrate energy technologies at scale (Anadón 2012; Mazzucato 2013; Nemet et al. 2018). This greater difficulty in reaching the market compared to other sectors may have contributed to a reduction in private equity and venture capital finance for renewable energy technologies after the boom of the late 2000s (Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre/BNEF 2019)."

There remains a crucial need for more relevant and comprehensive approaches of assessing innovation (Freeman and Soete 2009; Dziallas and Blind 2019). In the context of climate mitigation, innovation is a means to an end; therefore, there is the need to consider the processes by which the output of innovation (e.g., patents) are translated into real-world outcomes (e.g., deployment of low-carbon technologies) (Freeman and Soete 1997; Sagar and Holdren 2002). Currently, there is no available set of quantitative metrics that, collectively, can help get a picture of innovation in a particular energy technology or set of energy technologies. Also we are still lacking an understanding of how to systematically use qualitative indicators to characterise the more intangible aspects of the energy innovation system and to improve front-end innovation decisions (Dziallas and Blind 2019)."
wg3_ch16_16.3.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Because of the multiple market, government, system, and other failures that are associated with the energy system, a range of policy interventions are usually required to enable the development and introduction of new technologies in the market (Jaffe et al. 2005; Bürer and Wüstenhagen 2009; Negro et al. 2012; Twomey 2012; Veugelers 2012; Weber and Rohracher 2012) used in what is termed as ‘policy mixes’ (Rogge and Reichardt 2016; Edmondson et al. 2019, 2020; Rogge et al. 2020). Empirical research shows that, in the energy and environment space, when new technologies were developed and introduced in the market, it was usually at least partly as a result of a range of policies that shaped the socio-technical system (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Bunn et al. 2014; Bergek et al. 2015; Rogge and Reichardt 2016; Nemet 2019). An example of this systemic and dynamic nature of policies is the 70-year innovation journey of solar photovoltaic (PV), covering multiple countries, which is reviewed in Box 16.4."
wg3_ch16_16.3.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are many definitions of policy mixes from various disciplines (Rogge et al. 2017), including environmental economics (Lehmann 2012), policy studies (Kern and Howlett 2009) and innovation studies. Generally speaking, a policy mix can be characterised by a combination of building blocks, namely elements, processes and characteristics, which can be specified using different dimensions (Rogge and Reichardt 2016). Elements include: (i) the policy strategy with its objectives and principal plans; (ii) the mix of policy instruments; and (iii) instrument design. The content of these elements is the result of policy processes. Both elements and processes can be described by their characteristics in terms of the consistency of the elements, the coherence of the processes, and the credibility and comprehensiveness of the policy mix in different policy, governance, geography and temporal context (Rogge and Reichardt 2016). Other aspects in the evaluation of policy mixes include framework conditions, the type of policy instrument and the lower level of policy granularity, namely design elements or design features (del Río 2014; del Río and Cerdá 2017). In addition, many have argued for the need to craft policies that affect different actors in the transition, some supporting and some ‘destabilising’ (Geels 2002; Kivimaa and Kern 2016)."
wg3_ch16_16.3.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Learning from the innovation systems literature, some of the recent policy focus is not only directed on innovation policies that can optimise the innovation system to improve economic competitiveness and growth, but also policies that can induce strategic directionality and guide processes of transformative changes towards desired societal objectives (Mitcham 2003; Steneck 2006). Therefore, the aim is to connect innovation policy with societal challenges and transformative changes through engagement with a variety of actors and ideas and incorporating equity, nowadays often referred to as a ‘just transition’ (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Swilling et al. 2016; Heffron and McCauley 2018; Jasanoff 2018) (Chapters 1 and 17).

Second, it explains why governments put in place policies to promote innovation in climate-related technologies. Third, it takes stock of the overall empirical and theoretical evidence regarding the relationship between policy instruments with a direct and an indirect impact on innovation outcomes (including intellectual property regimes) and also other outcomes (competitiveness and distributional outcomes).

Both technology push (e.g., scientific training, research and development (R&D)) and demand pull (e.g., economic and fiscal support and regulatory policy instruments), as well as instruments promoting knowledge flows and especially research-firm technology transfer, can be part of the mix (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Sections 16.2 and 16.3)."
wg3_ch16_16.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Public R&D investments in energy and climate-related technologies have a positive impact on innovation outcomes (medium evidence,  high agreement ).

The review of the literature in this section shows that market pull policy instruments had positive but also some negative impacts on outcomes in some instances on some aspects of competitiveness and distributional outcomes (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Peñasco et al. 2021). For several of them – such as carbon taxes or feed-in tariffs – the evidence of a positive impact on innovation is more consistent than the others.

Typically, technology push is especially important for early-stage technologies, characterised by higher uncertainty and lower appropriability (Section 16.2); demand-pull instruments become more relevant in the later stages of the innovation process (Mowery and Rosenberg 1979; Anadon and Holdren 2009; Nemet 2009b) (Section 16.2)."

As Table 16.8 shows, this section discusses the set of policy instruments on innovation outcomes, or a subset of the ‘Transformative Potential’ criterion presented in Chapter 13, and thus complements the more general discussion presented there. Table 16.8 specifically prioritises the impact of the subset of policy instruments on innovation outcomes for which evidence is available. This focus is complemented by a discussion of the impact of the same policy instruments on competitiveness (a subcomponent of the economic effectiveness evaluation criterion) and on distributional outcomes.

Co-benefits of policies shaping technological innovation in climate-related technologies, including competitiveness, health, and improved distributional impacts can be drivers of climate mitigation policy in the innovation sphere (Stokes and Warshaw 2017; Deng et al. 2018; Probst et al. 2020).

In the first phase of ‘niche market diffusion’, the politics of more sustained support for a technology or set of technologies become possible after a group of economic winners and ‘clean energy constituencies’ are created (Meckling et al. 2015). When technologies grow out of the niche (second phase), they pose a more serious competition to incumbents who may become more vocal opponents of additional support for innovation in the competing technologies (Geels 2014; Stokes 2016). In a third phase, path-dependence in policymaking and lock-in in institutions need to change to accommodate new infrastructure, the integration of technologies, the emergence of complementary technologies and of new regulatory regimes (Levin et al. 2012; Aklin and Urpelainen 2013)."

Given this and the current policy focus on green recovery and green industrial policy, we assess impacts on competitiveness and equity, although we primarily focus on innovation outcomes. Table 16.9 lists the selected set of indicators used to assess the impact of the policy instrument types covered in the right-hand column in Table 16.8.

Research in Japan on R&D funding in general (not for climate-related technologies) however, indicates that R&D funds allocated competitively result in higher novelty for ‘high status’ (the term used in the paper to refer to senior male researchers), while block funding was associated with research of higher novelty for ‘lower status’ researchers (e.g., junior female researchers) (Wang et al. 2018)."

Just as for R&D investments, research has indicated that effective demand pull needs to be credible, durable, and aligned with other policies (Nemet et al. 2017) and that the effectiveness of different demand-pull instruments depends on policy design (del Río and Kiefer 2021). Historical analyses of the relative importance of demand pull and technology push are clear: both are needed to provide robust incentives for investment in innovation. Interactions between them are central as their combination enables innovators to connect a technical opportunity with a market opportunity (Freeman 1995; Jacobsson et al. 2004; Grubler and Wilson 2013). It is important to note that these market pull policies are often put in place primarily to meet security and/or environmental goals, although innovation and competitiveness are sometimes also pursued explicitly."

(2021) review 20 evaluations: eight identified a positive impact (although in at least two cases, the paper indicated that the impact was small or negligible); 11 no impact; and one was associated with a negative impact on innovation indicators. The studies that found no impact and the studies that found some impact covered all three methods (quantitative ex post , qualitative and theoretical and ex ante analysis). Another review focused only on empirical studies (mainly quantitative but also qualitative), covered a slightly longer period and identified 19 studies (15 using quantitative methods) (Lilliestam et al. 2021). With a narrower set of indicators of innovation, they concluded that there was very little empirical evidence linking innovation with the emissions trading schemes studied to date (Lilliestam et al. 2021). This review focused mainly on papers evaluating the earlier stages of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which featured relatively low carbon dioxide prices, and covered a small set of firms, showing that carbon pricing policy design is an important determinant of innovation outcomes. Combining both reviews, there are a total of 27 individual studies, some of them providing mixed evidence of impact, and 23 of them suggest there was no impact or that (in a couple of cases) it was small. It is important to note that some researchers note that, for particular subsectors and actors, emissions trading schemes have had an impact on patenting trends (Calel and Dechezleprêtre 2016). Overall the expectation is that higher prices and coverage would result in higher impacts and that, over time, the impact on innovation would grow."

Most of the evaluations reporting negative impacts were theoretical assessments, and only three ex post  quantitative analysis (Peñasco et al. 2021). Twenty-four evaluations covered distributional impacts of carbon taxes and other environmental taxes, the majority (15) found the existence of some negative distributional impacts, six found positive impacts, and three found no distributional impacts. Differences in the assessment results stem from the design of the taxes (Peñasco et al. 2021).

While FITs have been generally associated with positive innovation outcomes, some of the differences found in the literature may arise from differences in the evaluation method (Peñasco et al. 2021) or differences in policy design (e.g., the level and the rate of decrease of the tariff) (Hoppmann et al. 2014), the policy mixes (Rogge et al. 2017), the technologies targeted and their stage of development (Huenteler et al. 2016b), and the geographical and temporal context of where the policy was put in place (Section 16.3). Research has also found that, particularly for less mature technologies, a higher technology specificity in the design of FITs is associated with more innovation (Del Río 2012). FITs yield better results if they account for the specificities of the country; or else, the technology and the policy could result in negative distributional and (to a lesser extent) competitiveness impacts. Meckling et al. (2017) indicate that an ‘enduring challenge’ of technology-specific industrial policy such as some FITs is to avoid locking in suboptimal clean technologies – a challenge which, among other options, could be overcome with targeted niche procurement for next-generation technologies. Other authors have cautioned that the move from renewable FITs to auctions may favour existing PVs (e.g., polysilicon) over more novel solar power technologies (Sivaram 2018b) such as thin-film PV, amorphous PV, and perovskites."

Prioritising low-cost energy generation in the design of FIT schemes can result in a lower focus of innovation efforts on more novel technologies and greater barriers to incumbents in less mature technologies (Hoppmann et al. 2013). Similarly, case study research from Mexico and South Africa indicates that focusing on low-cost renewable energy generation can only result in a greater reliance on existing foreign value chains and capital, and thus in lower or negative impacts on domestic competitiveness. In other words, some approaches can hinder the development of the local capabilities that could result in greater long-term benefits domestically (Matsuo and Schmidt 2019). Evidence for developing countries indicates that local and absorptive capacity also play an important role, in particular, on the ability of policies to contribute to competitiveness or industrial policy goals (Binz and Anadon 2018). Research comparing China’s and India’s policies and outcomes on wind energy also suggest that policy durability and systemic approaches can affect industrial outcomes (Surana and Anadon 2015)."

There is more evidence covering emerging economies analysing the impacts of auctions when compared to other policy instrument types. For example, there is work comparing the approaches to renewable energy auctions in South Africa and Denmark (Toke 2015) finding a positive impact on the latter stages of innovation (mainly deployment), and broader work on auctions covering OECD countries as well as Brazil, South Africa and China not finding a significant impact on innovation (Wigand et al. 2016). Work comparing renewable energy auctions in different countries in South America generally finds a positive impact on innovation outcomes (Mastropietro et al. 2014). The body of evidence on the impact of auctions on competitiveness is also limited (six evaluations) and indicates negative outcomes of renewable auctions of competitiveness (limited evidence, low agreement ).

Evidence comes from both observational studies that examine patenting, R&D or technological responses to regulatory interventions, and from surveys and qualitative case studies in which firms report regulatory compliance as a driving force for the introduction of environmentally-beneficial innovations (Grubb et al. 2021). While the literature examining the impact of environmental regulation on innovation is large, there have been fewer studies on the innovation effects of minimum energy or emissions performance regulations specifically relating to climate mitigation. We discuss in turn two types of efficiency regulations: on vehicles, and on appliances."

(2021). Detailed studies on the innovation effects of national pollutant (rather than energy) regulations on automotive innovation also indicate that introducing or tightening performance standards has driven technological change (Lee et al. 2010). Some studies in the USA that examine periods in which little regulatory change took place have found that the effects of performance standards on fuel economy have been small (Knittel 2011) or not significant relative to the innovation effects of prices (Crabb and Johnson 2010). This is at least in part because ongoing efficiency improvements during this period were offset by increases in other product attributes. For example, a study by Knittel (2011) observed that size and power increased without a corresponding increase in fuel consumption. It has also been observed that regulatory design may introduce distortions that affect automotive innovation choices: in particular, fuel economy standards based on weight classes have been observed to distort light-weighting strategies for fuel efficiency in both China (Hao et al. 2016) and Japan (Ito and Sallee 2018)."

In the years immediately after introduction of the policy, automotive firms reported that it was a significant stimulus to their R&D activity in electric vehicles (Brown et al. 1995). Quantitative evidence examining patents and prototypes has indicated that the stringency of the policy was a significant factor in stimulating innovation, though this was, in part, dependent on firm strategy (Sierzchula and Nemet 2015).

Other work links FDI with increased productivity across firms (not just those engaged in climate-related technologies) through spillovers (Newman et al. 2015). In addition, Brandão and Ehrl (2019) indicate that productivity of the electric power industry is more influenced by the transfer of embodied technology from other industries than by investments of the power industry.

wg3_ch16_16.4.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Patent systems aim to promote innovation and economic growth, by stimulating both the creation of new knowledge and diffusion of that knowledge ( high evidence,  high agreement ). National patent systems, as institutions, play a central role in theories on national innovation systems ( high evidence, strong agreement ). Patent systems are usually instituted to promote innovation and economic growth (Machlup and Penrose 1950; Nelson and Mazzoleni 1996; Encaoua et al. 2006). Some countries explicitly refer to this purpose in their law or legislation – for instance, the US Constitution states the purpose of the US IP rights system to ‘promote the progress of science and useful arts’. Patent systems aim to reach their goals by trying to strike a balance between the creation of new knowledge and diffusion of that knowledge (Scotchmer and Green 1990; Devlin 2010; Anadon et al. 2016b). They promote the creation of new knowledge (e.g., technological inventions) by providing a temporary, exclusive right to the holder of the patent, thus providing incentives to develop such new knowledge and helping parties to justify investments in R&D. They promote the diffusion of this new knowledge via the detailed disclosure of the invention in the patent publication, and by enabling a ‘market for knowledge’ via trading patents and issuing licences (Arora et al. 2004). Although IP protections provide incentives to invest in innovation, they can also restrict the use of new knowledge by raising prices or blocking follow-on innovation (Wallerstein et al. 1993; Stiglitz 2008). As institutions, national patent systems feature prominently in models and theories of national innovation systems (Edquist 1997; Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005)."
wg3_ch16_16.4.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"The degree to which patent systems actually promote innovation is subject to debate. Patent protection has been found to have a positive impact on R&D activities in patent-intensive industries, but this effect was found to be conditional on access to finance (Maskus et al. 2019). Patents are believed to be especially important to facilitate innovation in selected areas such as pharmaceuticals, where investments in developments and clinical trials are high, imitation costs are low, and there is often a one-to-one relationship between a patent and a product, referred to as a ‘discrete’ product industry (Cohen et al. 2000). At the same time, an increasing body of theoretical and empirical literature suggests that the proliferation of patents also discourages innovation (medium evidence, low agreement ). Theoretical contributions note that a appropriability regime that is too stringent may greatly limit the diffusion of advanced technological knowledge and eventually block the development of differentiated technological capabilities within an industry, in what is called an ‘appropriability trap’ (Edquist 1997; Klein Woolthuis et al. 2005). There has been a long-standing debate on the impact of patents and other IP rights on innovation and economic development (Machlup 1958; Hall and Helmers 2019). Jaffe and Lerner (2004) and Bessen and Meurer (2009) highlight how IP rights also hamper innovation in a variety of ways. Other contributions in the literature focus on more specific factors. For example, Shapiro (2001) discusses ‘patent thickets’, where overlapping sets of patent rights mean that those seeking to commercialise new technology need to obtain licences from multiple patentees. Heller and Eisenberg (1998) argue that a ‘tragedy of the anticommons’ is likely to emerge when too many parties obtain the right to exclude others from using fragmented and overlapping pieces of knowledge – ultimately leading to no one having the privilege of using the results of biomedical research. Reitzig et al. (2007) describe the damaging effects of extreme business strategies employing patents, such as ‘patent trolling’."
wg3_ch16_16.4.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"In general, IP protection and enforcement may have different impacts on economic growth in different types of countries (limited evidence,  high agreement ). There has been a significant degree of harmonisation and cooperation between national IP systems over time. The most recent milestone is the World Trade Organization (WTO) 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, entered into by all WTO members, which sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of IP as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations (WTO 1994). Developing countries successfully managed to include some flexibilities into TRIPS, both in terms of timing of legislative reform, and the content of the reforms. In an attempt to understand the effects of the introduction of TRIPS, Falvey et al. (2006) find that the effect of IP protection on growth is positively and significantly related to growth for low- and high-income countries, but not for middle-income countries. They argue that low-income countries benefit from increased technology flows, but middle-income countries may have offsetting losses from the reduced scope for imitation. Note that Falvey et al. (2006) do not break down their results in different technological areas, and they do not focus on innovation, but instead on growth. It has been argued that the increasingly globalised IP regime through initiatives such as the TRIPS agreement will diminish prospects for technology transfer and competition in developing countries, particularly for several important technology areas related to meeting sustainable development needs (Maskus and Reichman 2017)."
wg3_ch16_16.4.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"In principle, patent holders are not required to take their protected invention into use, and neither have the obligation to allow (i.e., license) others to use the inventions in question ( high evidence,  high agreement ). Studies have shown that the way patent holders use their patent differs considerably across industrial sectors: in pharmaceutics, patents are typically used to enable exclusive production of a certain good (and obtain monopoly rents), while in industries such as computers, semiconductors, and communications, patents are often used to strengthen positions in cross-licensing negotiations and to generate licensing income (Cohen et al. 2000; Foray 2004). There are also companies that predominantly obtain patents for defensive reasons: they seek freedom to design and manufacture, and by owning a patent portfolio themselves, they hope to prevent becoming the target of litigation by other patent holders (Hall and Ziedonis 2001). Patents are often used strategically to impede the development and diffusion of competing, alternative products, processes or services, by employing strategies known as ‘blanketing’ and ‘fencing’ (Grandstrand 2000), although the research is not specific to the climate space."
wg3_ch16_16.4.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"There are notable but specific exceptions to the general principle that patent holders are not obliged to license their patent to others. These exceptions include the compulsory licence, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) policies, and statement on licences of right ( high evidence,  high agreement ). While patent holders are, in principle, free to choose not to license their innovation, there are three important exceptions to this. First, most national patent laws have provisions for compulsory licensing, meaning that a government allows someone else to produce a patented product or process without the consent of the patent holder, or plans to use the patent-protected invention itself (WTO 2020). Compulsory licences may be issued in cases of public interest or events of abuse of the patent (WIPO 2008; Biadgleng 2009). Compulsory licensing is explicitly allowed in the WTO TRIPS agreement, and its use in context of medicine (for instance, to control diseases of public health importance, including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria) is further clarified in the ‘DOHA Declaration’ from 2001 (Reichman 2009; WHO 2020). Second, standard-setting organisations have policies to include patented inventions in their standards only if the patent holder is willing to commit FRAND licensing conditions for those patents (Contreras 2015). While a patent holder can choose not to make such a commitment, by doing so, its patent is no longer a candidate for inclusion in the standard. In the (many) fields where standards are of key importance, it is very unusual for patent holders not to be willing to enter into FRAND commitments (Bekkers 2017). Third, when a patent holder files at the patent office and opts for the ‘licence of right’ regime, in return for reduced patent fees, they enter into a contractual agreement that obliges them to license the patent to those who request it. While not all national patent systems feature this regime, it is a feature present in the new European Community patent (EPO 2017), and may therefore increase in importance."

wg3_ch16_16.4.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Research examining the impacts of sub-national policies on innovation and competitiveness is sporadic – regional variations have been quantitatively assessed in the USA or China, or with case studies in these and other countries. Research on wind energy in the USA, distributed PV balance of systems in China, and renewable energy technologies in Italy have found that policies that incentivised local demand were associated with inducing innovation, measured with patents (Corsatea 2016; Fu et al. 2018; Gao and Rai 2019). Different policies may have different impacts – for example, in the USA, state-level tax incentives and subsidies induced innovation within the state; but for renewable portfolio standards, policies in other states were associated with innovation because of impact on demand, but own-state policies were not (Fu et al. 2018). Research has also noted that the outcomes of policy and regulation on innovation are spatially heterogenous, because of differences in local planning authorities and capabilities (Corsatea 2016; Song et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch16_16.4.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Sub-national deployment policies have been associated with different impacts on competitiveness metrics (limited evidence, medium agreement ). Research on green jobs shows positive association between sub-national policies and green jobs or green firms at the metropolitan level as well as the state of provincial level, in both China and the USA (Yi 2013; Yi and Liu 2015; Lee 2017), while others find no impact of renewable portfolio standards on green job growth in the state (Bowen et al. 2013). Other examples of competitiveness are in the impact of regional green industrial policy in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul region in attracting auctioned contracts for wind energy (Adami et al. 2017) or in the changes in net positive state revenues associated with removing tax incentives for wind producers in Idaho in the USA (Black et al. 2014)."

The literature on the impacts of such policies on innovation and competitiveness is sparse. Some case studies and programme evaluation reports, primarily in the USA, have identified the impacts of sub-national policies on competitiveness — for example, job creation from direct R&D funding in North Carolina (Hall and Link 2015), perceptions for local industry development and support for follow-on financing for companies receiving state-funded grants in Colorado (Surana et al. 2020b), and return on investments for the state in research and innovation spending from the New York state’s energy agency (NYSERDA 2020). There is a general paucity of metrics on innovation and competitiveness for systematic assessments of such programmes in developed countries, and even more so in India and other developing countries where such programmes have been increasing (Gonsalves and Rogerson 2019; Surana et al. 2020a)."
wg3_ch16_16.4.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"Although states and local governments increasingly support clean energy deployment as well as directly support innovation, given its link with economic development goals, there is a lack of systematic research on the impacts of these policies at the subnational level.

Although the outcome studied was not innovation, but diffusion (technology effectiveness is in the set of criteria outlined in Chapter 13), it seems relevant to discuss overall findings. Research reviewing renewable energy policies in nine OECD countries concludes that, over time, a broad set of policies characterised by a ‘balance’ metric has been put in place. This research also identifies a significant negative association between the balance of policies in renewable energy and the diffusion of total renewable energy capacity, but no significant effect of the overall intensity (coded as the 46 weighted average of six indicators) on renewable capacity (Schmidt and Sewerin 2019). This indicates that a neutral conception of balance across all possible policies may not be desirable, and that policy mix intensity by itself does not explain technology diffusion."

wg3_ch16_16.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"With the submission of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement, most developing countries are now engaged in climate mitigation and adaptation. While technology is seen as one of the ‘means of implementation’ of climate action, developing countries often have relatively limited technology innovation capabilities, which requires them to access technologies developed in higher-income countries with stronger innovation systems (Popp 2011; Binz et al. 2012; Urban 2018). In many cases, these technologies require adaptation for the local context and needs (Sagar 2009; Anadon et al. 2016b), and innovation capabilities are required to suitably adapt these technologies for local use and also to create new markets and business models that are required for successful deployment (Sagar 2009; Ockwell et al. 2015; Ockwell and Byrne 2016). This can lead to dependencies on foreign knowledge and providers (Ockwell and Byrne 2016), negative impacts in terms of higher costs (Huenteler et al. 2016a), balance of payments constraints, and vulnerability to external shocks (Ebeling 2020)."
wg3_ch16_16.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The climate technology transition can also yield other development benefits, for instance better health, increased energy access, poverty alleviation and economic competitiveness (Deng et al. 2018), including industrial development, job creation and economic growth (Porter and Van der Linde 1995; Altenburg and Rodrik 2017; Lema et al. 2020; Pegels and Altenburg 2020) (Section 16.6). The growing complexity of technologies and global competition have made technology development a globalised process involving the flow of knowledge and products across borders (Lehoux et al. 2014; Koengkan et al. 2020). For instance, in electronics production, Asian economies have captured co-location synergies and dominate production and assembly of product components, whereas American firms have adopted ‘design-only’ strategies (Tassey 2014). In the context of renewable energy technologies, ‘green global division of labour’ has been observed, with countries specialising in investments in research and development (R&D), manufacturing or deployment of renewables (Lachapelle et al. 2017). In the case of solar photovoltaic (PV), for example, while many technical innovations emerged from the USA, Japan and China emphasised the manufacture of physical modules (Deutch and Steinfeld 2013) (Box 16.4)."
wg3_ch16_16.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Such globalisation of production and supply chains opens up economic development opportunities for developing countries (Lema et al. 2020). At the same time, not all countries benefit from the globalisation of innovation – barriers remain related to finance, environmental performance, human capabilities and cost (Weiss and Bonvillian 2013; Egli et al. 2018), with developing countries being particularly disadvantaged at leveraging these opportunities. The gap in low-carbon technology innovation between countries appears to have reduced only among OECD countries (Yan et al. 2017; Du and Li 2019; Du et al. 2019) and the lower-income countries are not able to benefit as much from low-carbon technologies. For instance, in the case of agriculture, Fuglie (2018) notes that international R&D spillovers seem to have benefitted developed countries more than developing countries. Gross et al. (2018) also argue that the development timescales for new energy technologies can extend up to 70 years, even within one country. They recommend that innovation efforts be balanced between early-stage R&D spending, and commercialising already low-emission technologies in the demonstration phase and diffusing them globally."
wg3_ch16_16.5.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Thus international cooperation on technology development and transfer can enable developing countries to achieve their climate goals more effectively, while also addressing other SDGs – taking advantage, where possible, of the globalisation of innovation and production (Lema et al. 2020). Earlier assessments in AR5 and SR1.5 have made it clear that international technology transfer and cooperation could play a role in climate policy at both the international and the domestic policy level (Somanathan et al. 2014; Stavins et al. 2014; IPCC 2018b) and for low-carbon development at the regional level (Agrawala et al. 2014). The Paris Agreement also reflects this view by noting that countries shall strengthen cooperative action on technology development and transfer regarding two main aspects: (i) promoting collaborative approaches to R&D; and (ii) facilitating access to technology to developing country Parties (UNFCCC 2015). Furthermore, both in literature and in UNFCCC deliberations, South-South technology transfer is highlighted (Khosla et al. 2017) as a complement to the transfer of technology and know-how from the North to the South."
wg3_ch16_16.5.1_p5,NO_TITLE,This is consistent with literature that suggests that greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in developing countries can be enhanced by: (i) technology development and transfer collaboration and a ‘needs-driven’ approach; (ii) development of the specific types of capacity required across the entire innovation chain; and (iii) strengthening of the coordination and agendas across and between governance levels (including domestic and international levels) (Khosla et al. 2017; Zhou 2019; Upadhyaya et al. 2020).
wg3_ch16_16.5.2_p1,Enhancing Low-emission Technology Uptake in Developing Countries ,"International efforts involving technology transfer can have different objectives and roles. These include access to knowledge and financial resources as well as promotion of new industries in both the developed and recipient country (Huh and Kim 2018). Based on an econometric analysis of international technology transfer factors and characteristics of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects, Gandenberger et al. (2016) find that complexity and novelty of technologies explain whether a CDM project includes hardware technology transfer, and that factors like project size and absorptive capacity of the host country do not seem to be drivers. Halleck Vega and Mandel (2018) argue that ‘long-term economic relations’, for instance being part of a customs union, affect technological diffusion between countries in the case of wind energy, and indicate that this has resulted in low-income countries being largely overlooked."
wg3_ch16_16.5.2_p2,Enhancing Low-emission Technology Uptake in Developing Countries ,"There is some literature studying whether technology cooperation could complement or replace international cooperation based on emission reductions, such as in the Kyoto Protocol, and whether that would have positive impacts on climate change mitigation and compliance. A handful of papers conducted game-theoretic analysis on technology cooperation, sometimes as an alternative for cooperation on emission reductions, and found partially positive effects (Bosetti et al. 2017; Narita and Wagner 2017; Rubio 2017; Verdolini and Bosetti 2017). However, Sarr and Swanson (2017) model that, due to the rebound effect, technology development and transfer of resource-saving technologies may not lead to envisioned emission reductions."
wg3_ch16_16.5.2_p3,Enhancing Low-emission Technology Uptake in Developing Countries ,"While technology cooperation can be aimed at emission reduction through mitigation projects, as indicated above, not all cooperative actions directly result in mitigation outcomes. Overall, technology transfer broadly has focused on: (i) enhanced climate technology absorption and deployment in developing countries; and (ii) enhanced research, development and demonstration (RD&D) through cooperation and knowledge spillovers."
wg3_ch16_16.5.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Real-world outcomes in terms of low-emission technology deployment in developing countries may vary significantly, depending on the nature of the international engagement and the domestic context. While there has been some success in the enhancement of technology deployment through technology transfer in some developing countries (de la Tour et al. 2011; Zhang and Gallagher 2016), many others, and particularly least-developed countries, are lagging behind (Glachant and Dechezleprêtre 2017). Glachant and Dechezleprêtre (2017) indicate that this is due to the lack of participation in economic globalisation and that climate negotiations could facilitate technology transfer to those countries through the creation of global demand for low-emission technologies through stronger mitigation targets that will result in lowering of costs and therefore enhanced technology diffusion. A broader perspective presents a host of other factors that govern technology diffusion and commercialisation in developing countries, including: investment; social, cultural and behavioural, marketing and market building; macroeconomics; and support policy (Bakhtiar et al. 2020). Ramos Mejía et al.

Furthermore, existing interests, such as fossil fuel production, may also impede the deployment of low-emission technologies, as highlighted in case studies of Vietnam and Indonesia (Dorband et al. 2020; Ordonez et al. 2021). It is for such reasons that both domestic efforts and international engagement are seen as necessary to facilitate technology transfer as well as deployment in developing countries (Boyd 2012). The same has been seen as true in the case of agriculture, where the very successful international research efforts of the CGIAR – with remarkably favourable benefit-cost ratios (Alston et al. 2021) – were complemented by the national agricultural research systems for effective uptake of high-yielding varieties of crops (Evenson and Gollin 2003)."

wg3_ch16_16.5.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technology development and transfer have been a part of UNFCCC discussions and developments in the context of the international climate negotiations ever since its agreement in 1992, as assessed in AR5 (Stavins et al. 2014). Support on ‘Technology Needs Assessment’ to developing countries was the first major action undertaken by the UNFCCC, and this has undergone different cycles of learning (Nygaard and Hansen 2015; Hofman and van der Gaast 2019). Since 2009, the UNFCCC discussions on technology development and transfer have focused on the Technology Mechanism under the Cancun Agreements of 2010, which can be seen as the global climate governance answer to redistributive claims by developing countries (McGee and Wenta 2014). The Technology Mechanism consists of the TEC and the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN). An independent review of CTCN, evaluated it on five dimensions – relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impacts and sustainability – and indicated that the organisation is achieving its mandate in all these dimensions, although there are some possible areas of improvement. The review also specifically noted that ‘the lack of predictability and security over financial resources significantly affected the CTCN’s ability to deliver services at the expected level, as did the CTCN’s lack of human and organizational resources and the capacity of NDEs [National Designated Entities].’ (TEC 2017). The CTCN has overcome some of the limitations imposed by resource constraints by acting as a matchmaker from an open-innovation perspective (Lee and Mwebaza 2020). The CTCN’s lack of financial sustainability has been a recurring issue, which may potentially be resolved by deepening the linkage between the CTCN and Green Climate Fund (Oh 2020). In the meanwhile, the Green Climate Fund is planning to establish the Climate Innovation Facility to support and accelerate early-stage innovations and climate technologies through the establishment of regional innovation hubs and climate accelerators as well as a climate growth fund (Green Climate Fund 2020)."

Since 2009, the UNFCCC discussions on technology development and transfer have focused on the Technology Mechanism under the Cancun Agreements of 2010, which can be seen as the global climate governance answer to redistributive claims by developing countries (McGee and Wenta 2014). The Technology Mechanism consists of the TEC and the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN). An independent review of CTCN, evaluated it on five dimensions – relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impacts and sustainability – and indicated that the organisation is achieving its mandate in all these dimensions, although there are some possible areas of improvement. The review also specifically noted that ‘the lack of predictability and security over financial resources significantly affected the CTCN’s ability to deliver services at the expected level, as did the CTCN’s lack of human and organizational resources and the capacity of NDEs [National Designated Entities].’ (TEC 2017). The CTCN has overcome some of the limitations imposed by resource constraints by acting as a matchmaker from an open-innovation perspective (Lee and Mwebaza 2020). The CTCN’s lack of financial sustainability has been a recurring issue, which may potentially be resolved by deepening the linkage between the CTCN and Green Climate Fund (Oh 2020). In the meanwhile, the Green Climate Fund is planning to establish the Climate Innovation Facility to support and accelerate early-stage innovations and climate technologies through the establishment of regional innovation hubs and climate accelerators as well as a climate growth fund (Green Climate Fund 2020)."

Others have suggested a shift to international innovation cooperation rather than technology transfer, which implies a donor-recipient relationship. The notion of innovation cooperation also makes more explicit the focus on innovation processes and systems (Pandey et al. 2021). A broad transformative agenda therefore proposes that contemporary societal challenges are complex and multivariegated in scope and will require the actions of a diverse set of actors to formulate and address the policy, implying that social, institutional and behavioural changes next to technological innovations are the possible solutions (Geels 2004) (see also Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter)."

Technology has been critical for increasing productivity as the dominant driving force for economic growth. Also, the concentration of technology in few hands has boosted consumption of goods and services which are not necessarily aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Walsh et al. 2020). It has been suggested that, in order to address sustainable development challenges, science and technology actors would have to change their relation to policymakers (Ravetz and Funtowicz 1999) as well as the public (Jasanoff 2003). This has been further elaborated for the SDGs. The scale and ambition of the SDGs call for a change in development patterns that require a fundamental shift in: current best practices; guidelines for technological and investment decisions; and the wider socio-institutional systems (UNCTAD 2019; Pegels and Altenburg 2020). This is needed as not all innovation will lead to sustainable development patterns (Altenburg and Pegels 2012; Lema et al. 2015)."

These relationships have been approached by focusing primarily on synergies and trade-offs while lacking the holistic perspective necessary to achieve all the goals (Nilsson et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2018)."

From a science, technology and innovation perspective, Fu et al. (2019) distinguish three categories of SDGs. The first category comprises those SDGs representing essential human needs for which inputs that put pressure on sustainable development would need to be minimised. These include Zero hunger (SDG 2), Clear water and sanitation (SDG 6) and Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) resources, which continue to rely on production technologies and practices that are eroding ecosystem services, potentially hampering the realisation of SDGs 15 (Life on land) and 14 (Life below water) (Díaz et al. 2019). The second category includes those related to governance and which compete with each other for scarce resources, such as Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9) and Climate action (SDG 13), which require an interdisciplinary perspective. The third category are those that require maximum realisation, include No poverty (SDG 1), Quality education (SDG 4) and Gender equality (SDG 5) (Fu et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Resolving tensions between the SDGs requires adoption and mainstreaming of novel technologies that can meet needs while reducing resource waste and improving resource-use efficiency, and acknowledging the systemic nature of technological innovation, which involves many levels of actors, stages of innovation and scales (Anadon et al. 2016b). Changes in production technology have been found effective to overcome trade-offs between food and water goals (Gao and Bryan 2017). Innovative technologies at the food, water and energy nexus are transforming production processes in industrialised and developing countries, such as developments in agrivoltaics, which is co-development of land for agriculture and solar with water conservation benefits (Barron-Gafford et al. 2019; Lytle et al. 2020; Schindele et al. 2020), and other renewably powered low- to zero-carbon food, water and energy systems (He et al. 2019). Silvestre and Ţîrcă (2019) indicate that maximising both social and environmental aims is not possible, but that sustainable innovations include satisfactory solutions for social, environmental and economic pillars (Figure 16.4)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"There is evidence that technological changes can catalyse implementation of the reforms needed to the manner in which goods and services are distributed among people (Fu et al. 2019). A recently developed theoretical framework based on a capability approach (CA) has been used to evaluate the quality of human life and the process of development (Haenssgen and Ariana 2018). Variations of the CA have been applied to exploratory studies of the link between technological change, human development, and economic growth (Mayer 2001; Mormina 2019). This suggests that the transformative potential of technology as an enabling condition is not intrinsic, but is assigned to it by people within a given technological context. A failure to recognise and account for this property of technology is a root cause of many failed attempts at techno-fixing sustainable development projects (Stilgoe et al. 2013; Fazey et al. 2020)."

Such an environment poses high demands on governance and policy to coordinate with actors and provide a direction for innovation and technological change. Cross-Chapter Box 12 illustrates how the dynamics of socio-technical transitions and shifting development pathways towards sustainable development offer options for policymakers and other actors to accelerate the system transitions needed for both climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Governance interventions to implement the SDGs will need to be operationalised at sub-national, national and global levels and support integration of resource concerns in policy, planning and implementation (UNEP 2015; Williams et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Policies that shift innovation in climate compatible directions can promote other development benefits, for instance, better health, increased energy access, poverty alleviation and economic competitiveness (Deng et al. 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 12). Economic competitiveness co-benefits can emerge as climate mitigation policies trigger innovation that can be leveraged for promoting industrial development, job creation and economic growth, both in terms of localising low-emission energy technologies value chains as well as increased energy efficiency and avoided carbon lock-ins (Section 16.4). However, without adequate capabilities, co-benefits at the local level would be minimal, and they would probably materialise far from where activities take place (Ockwell and Byrne 2016; Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021). Innovation and technological change can also empower citizens. Grass-roots innovation promotes the participation of grass-roots actors, such as social movements and networks of academics, activists and practitioners, and facilitate experimenting with alternative forms of knowledge creation (Seyfang and Smith 2007; UNCTAD 2019). Examples of ordinary people and entrepreneurs adopting and adapting technologies to local needs to address locally defined needs have been documented in the development literature (van Welie and Romijn 2018) (Box 16.10). Digital technologies can empower citizens and communities in decentralised energy systems, contributing not only to a more sustainable but also to a more democratic and fairer energy system (Van Summeren et al. 2021) (Section 5.4 in Chapter 5, and Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter)."

Striving for synergies between innovation and technological change for climate change mitigation with other SDGs can help to secure effective long-term climate mitigation, as development benefits can create feedback effects that sustain public and political support for subsequent climate mitigation policies (Geels 2014; Meckling et al. 2015; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter). However, innovation is not always geared to sustainable development – for instance, firms tend to know how to innovate when value chains are left intact (Hall and Martin 2005), which is usually not the case in systemic transitions."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"A comprehensive study of these effects distinguishes among ‘… anticipated-intended, anticipated-unintended, and unanticipated-unintended consequences’ (Tonn and Stiefel 2019). Theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that unintended consequences are typical of complex adaptive systems, and while a few are predictable, a much larger number are not (Sadras 2020). Even when unintended consequences are unanticipated, they can be prevented through actor responses, for instance, rebound effects following the introduction of energy-efficient technologies. Other examples of unintended consequences include worse-than-expected physical damage to infrastructure and resistance from communities in the rapidly growing ocean renewable energy sector (Quirapas and Taeihagh 2020), and gaps between expected and actual performance of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology (Boyd and Schweber 2018; Gram-Hanssen and Georg 2018). In the agricultural sector, new technologies and associated practices that target the fitness of crop pests have been found to favour resistant variants. Unintended consequences of digitalisation are reported as well (Lynch et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Innovation and climate mitigation policies can also have negative socio-economic impacts, and not all countries, actors and regions around the world benefit equally from rapid technological change (Deng et al. 2018; McCauley and Heffron 2018; Eisenberg 2019; UNCTAD 2019; Henry et al. 2020). In fact, socio-technical transitions often create winners and losers (Roberts et al. 2018). Technological change can reinforce existing divides between women and men, rural and urban populations, and rich and poor communities: older workers displaced by technological change will not qualify for jobs if they were unable to acquire new skills; weak educational systems may not prepare young people for emerging employment opportunities; and disadvantaged social groups, including women in many countries, often have fewer opportunities for formal education (McCauley and Heffron 2018; UNCTAD 2019). That is a risk regarding technological change for climate change mitigation, as emerging evidence suggests that the energy transition can create jobs and productivity opportunities in the renewable energy sector, but will also lead to job losses in fossil fuel and exposed sectors (Le Treut et al. 2021). At the same time, these new jobs may use more intensively high-level cognitive and interpersonal skills compared to regular, traditional jobs, requiring higher levels of human capital dimensions such as formal education, work experience and on-the-job training (Consoli et al. 2016). Despite the empowerment potentials of decentralised energy systems, not all societal groups are equally positioned to benefit from energy community policies, with issues of energy justice taking place within initiatives, between initiatives and related actors, as well as beyond initiatives (Calzadilla and Mauger 2018; van Bommel and Höffken 2021)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The opportunities and challenges of technological change can also differ within country regions and between countries (Garcia-Casals et al. 2019). Within countries, Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto (2021) show that, in the absence of policies and capacity-building activities which promote local recruiting, a significant part of total benefits of wind projects, especially high-income jobs and high value-added activities, is captured by already higher-income regions. Between countries, developing countries usually have lower innovation capabilities, which means they need to import low-emission technology from abroad and are also less able to adapt these technologies to local conditions and create new markets and business models. This can lead to external dependencies and limit opportunities to leverage economic benefits from technology transfer (Section 16.5.1)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"This means that, in countries below the technological frontier, the contribution of technological change to climate change mitigation can happen primarily through the adoption and less through the development of new technologies, which can reduce potential economic and welfare benefits from rapid technological change (UNCTAD 2019). The adoption of consumer information and communication technology (ICT) (Baller et al. 2016) or renewable energy technology (Lema et al. 2021) cannot bring least-developed economies close to the technological frontier without appropriate technological capabilities in other sectors, and an enabling innovation system (Ockwell and Mallett 2012; Sagar and Majumdar 2014; Ockwell et al. 2018; UNCTAD 2019; Malhotra et al. 2021; Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021). It has been argued widely that both hard and soft infrastructure, as well as appropriate policy frameworks and capability building, would facilitate developing countries’ engagement in long-term technological innovation and sustainable industrial development, and eventually in achieving the SDGs (Ockwell and Byrne 2016; Altenburg and Rodrik 2017; UNCTAD 2019)."

Technological change, as an inherently complex process (Funtowicz 2020), poses governance challenges (Bukkens et al. 2020) requiring social innovation (Repo and Matschoss 2019) (Section 5.6 and Chapter 13)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Prospects for effectively governing SDG-oriented technological transformations require, at a minimum, balanced views and new tools for securing the scientific legitimacy and credibility to connect public policy and technological change in society (Jasanoff 2018; Sadras 2020). Many frameworks of governance have been proposed, such as reflexive governance (Voss et al. 2006), polycentric governance (Ostrom 2010), collaborative governance (Bodin 2017), adaptive governance (Munene et al. 2018) and transformative governance (Rijke et al. 2013; Westley et al. 2013) (Chapters 13 and 14)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"A particular class of barriers to the development and adoption of new technologies comprises entrenched power relations dominated by vested interests that control and benefit from existing technologies (Chaffin et al. 2016; Dorband et al. 2020). Such interests can generate balancing feedbacks within multilevel social-technological regimes that are related to technological lock-in, including allocations of investment between fossil and renewable energy technologies (Unruh 2002; Sagar et al. 2009; Seto et al. 2016)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Weaker coordination and implementation capacity in some developing countries can undermine the ability to avoid trade-offs with other development objectives – such as reinforced inequalities or excessive indebtedness and increased external dependency – and can limit the potential of leveraging economic benefits from technologies transferred from abroad (Section 16.5 and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter). Van Welie and Romijn (2018) show that, in a low-income setting, the exclusion of some local stakeholders from the decision-making process may undermine sustainability transitions efforts. Countries with high levels of inequality can be more prone to elite capture, non-transparent political decision-making processes, relations based on clientelism and patronage, and no independent judiciary (Jasanoff 2018), although in particular contexts, non-elites manage to exert influence (Moldalieva and Heathershaw 2020). The dominance of incumbents, however, implies that sustainable technological transitions could be achieved without yielding any social and democratic benefits (Hansen et al. 2018). In the cultural domain, a recurrent policy challenge that has been observed in most countries is the limited public support for development and deployment of low-carbon technologies (Bernauer and McGrath 2016). The conventional approach to mobilising such support has been to portray technological change as a means of minimising climate change. Empirical studies show that simply reframing climate policy is highly unlikely to build and sustain public support (Bernauer and McGrath 2016)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Finally, there is a link between social and technological innovation; any innovation is grounded in complex socio-economic arrangements, to which governance arrangements would need to respond (Sections 5.5 and 5.6, Chapter 13, and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in this chapter). Social innovation can contribute to maximising synergies and minimising trade-offs in relation to technological and other innovative practices, but for this to materialise, national, regional and local circumstances need to be taken into account and, if needed, changed. Even in circumstances of high capabilities, the extent that social innovation might help to promote synergies and avoid trade-offs is not easy to evaluate (Grimm et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technological innovation may bring significant synergy in pursuing SDGs, but it may also create challenges to the economy, human well-being, and the environment (Schillo and Robinson 2017; Thacker et al. 2019; Walsh et al. 2020). The degree of potential synergies and trade-offs among SDGs differs from country to country and over time (Section 16.6.1.1). These potentials will depend on available resources, geographical conditions, development stage and policy measures. Even though synergies and trade-offs related to technological innovation have received the least attention from researchers (Deng et al. 2018), literature show that higher synergy was found where countries’ policies take into account the linkages between sectors (Mainali et al. 2018). For technology innovation to be effective in enhancing synergies and reducing trade-offs, its role and nature in production and consumption patterns, as well as in value chains and in the wider economy, requires clarification. Technology ownership and control together with its current orientation and focus towards productivity, needs to be revised if a meaningful contribution to the implementation of the SDGs is to be achieved in a transformative way (Walsh et al. 2020). Responsible innovation, combining anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness, has been suggested as a framework for conducting innovation (Stilgoe et al. 2013). Also inclusive innovation (Hoffecker 2021) could make sure that unheard voices and interests are included in decision-making, and that methods for this have been implemented in practice (Douthwaite and Hoffecker 2017)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are several examples of how to maximise synergies and avoid or minimise trade-offs when bringing technological innovation to the ground. When implementing off-grid solar energy in Rwanda, synergies were found between 80 of the 169 SDG targets, demonstrating how mainstreaming off-grid policies and prioritising investment in the off-grid sector can realise human development and well-being, build physical and social infrastructures, and achieve sustainable management of environmental resources (Bisaga et al. 2021). Another example is related to wind power in Northeast of Brazil where the creation of direct and indirect jobs has been demonstrated in areas where capabilities are high, as well as associated improvements in wholesale and retail trade and real estate activities, though this also emphasises the need for capacity development along with international collaboration projects (Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021). Other examples include studies raising awareness on solar energy and women’s empowerment (Winther et al. 2018) and recycling and waste ( Cross and Murray 2018)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Other actions with the potential to maximise synergies are those related to community or grassroots technological innovation. The importance of the link between technological innovation and community action and its contribution to sustainable development is usually underestimated. Further research is needed on this and, most importantly, its inclusion in the political agenda on sustainable development (Seyfang and Smith 2007). On the other hand, when technological innovation occurs far from where is implemented and participation in the production, and hence training activities of local actors is minimal, co-benefits and synergies among SDGs are limited and usually far below expectations (Bhamidipati and Hansen 2021; Vasconcellos and Caiado Couto 2021). Actions by policymakers that safeguard environmental and social aspects can boost synergies and maximise those co-benefits (Lema et al. 2021). Given that technological change impacts countries, regions and social groups differently, transition policies can be designed to ensure that all regions and communities are able to take advantage of the energy and other transitions (McCauley and Heffron 2018; Henry et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.3_p4,NO_TITLE,Box 16.10 provides insights on how a systemic approach to technological innovation can contribute to reconcile synergies and trade-offs to achieve sustainable development and mitigation goals.
wg3_ch16_16.6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"This section gives a synthesis of this chapter on innovation and technology development and transfer, connecting it to sustainable development."
wg3_ch16_16.6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"In conjunction with other enabling conditions, technological innovation can support system transitions to limit warming, help shift development pathways, and bring about new and improved ways of delivering goods and services that are essential to human well-being ( high confidence). At the same time, however, innovation can result in trade-offs that undermine progress on mitigation and towards other SDGs. Trade-offs include negative externalities, such as environmental impacts and social inequalities, rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased dependency on foreign knowledge and providers ( high confidence). Digitalisation, for example, holds both opportunity for emission reduction and emission-saving behaviour change, but at the same time causes significant environmental, social and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts (high confidence)."
wg3_ch16_16.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"A systemic view of innovation that takes into account the roles of actors, institutions, and their interactions, can contribute to enhanced understanding of processes and outcomes of technological innovation, and to interventions and arrangements that can help innovation. It can also play a role in clarifying the synergies and trade-offs between technological innovation and the SDGs. Effective governance and policy, implemented in an inclusive, responsible and holistic way, could make innovation policy more effective, and avoid and minimise misalignments between climate change mitigation, technological innovation, and other societal goals (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch16_16.6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"A special feature is the dynamics of transitions. Like other enabling conditions, technological innovation plays a balancing role – by inhibiting change as innovation strengthens incumbent technologies and practices – and a reinforcing role, by allowing new technologies and practices to disrupt the existing socio-technical regimes ( high confidence). Appropriate innovation policies can help to better organise innovation systems, while other policies (technology push and demand pull) can provide suitable resources and incentives to support and guide these innovation systems towards societally-desirable outcomes, ensure the innovations are deployed at scale, and direct these dynamics towards system transitions for climate change mitigation, and also towards addressing other SDGs. This means taking into account the full lifecycle or value chain as well as analysis of synergies and trade-offs."
wg3_ch16_16.6.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Against this backdrop, international cooperation on technological innovation is one of the enablers of climate action in developing countries on both mitigation and adaptation ( high confidence). Experiences with international cooperation on technology development and deployment suggest that such activities are most effective when they: are approached as ‘innovation cooperation’ that engenders a holistic, systemic view of innovation requirements; are an equitable partnership between donors and recipients; and develop local innovation capabilities (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch16_16.6.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Chapter 17, in particular Section 17.4, connects technological innovation with other enabling conditions, such as behaviour, institutional capacity and multilevel governance, to clarify the actions that could be taken, holistically and in conjunction, to strengthen and accelerate the system transitions required to limit warming to be in line with the Paris Agreement and to place countries in sustainable development pathways."
wg3_ch16_16.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Filling gaps in literature availability, data collection, modelling, application of frameworks and further analysis in several sectors will improve knowledge on innovation and technology development and transfer, including research and development (R&D) to support policymaking in climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. These policies and related interventions need to benefit from data and methodologies for the ex post  evaluation of their effectiveness."
wg3_ch16_16.7_p2,NO_TITLE,This section addresses identified knowledge gaps related to: what extent developing countries are represented in studies on innovation and technology development and transfer; national contexts and local innovation capacity; potential and actual contributions of businesses; literature emphasis on mitigation; indicators to assess innovation systems; non-technical barriers for the feasibility of decarbonisation pathways; the role of domestic intellectual property rights (IPR) policy; digitalisation in low-emissions pathways; and Paris Agreement compliance regarding technology and capacity building.
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.1 | 	Will innovation and technological changes be enough to meet the Paris Agreement objectives?_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Paris Agreement stressed the importance of development and transfer of technologies to improve resilience to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, innovation and even fast technological change will not be enough to achieve Paris Agreement mitigation objectives. Other changes are necessary across the production and consumption system and the society in general, including behavioural changes."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.1 | 	Will innovation and technological changes be enough to meet the Paris Agreement objectives?_p2,NO_TITLE,"Technological changes never happen in a vacuum; they are always accompanied by, for instance, people changing habits, companies changing value chains, or banks changing risk profiles. Therefore, technological changes driven by holistic approaches can contribute to accelerate and spread those changes towards the achievement of climate and sustainable development goals."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.1 | 	Will innovation and technological changes be enough to meet the Paris Agreement objectives?_p3,NO_TITLE,"In innovation studies, such systemic approaches are said to strengthen the functions of technological or national innovation systems, so that climate-friendly technologies can flourish. Innovation policies can help respond to local priorities and prevent unintended and undesirable consequences of technological change, such as unequal access to new technologies across countries and between income groups, environmental degradation and negative effects on employment."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.2 | 	What can be done to promote innovation for climate change and the widespread diffusion of low-emission and climate-resilient technology?_p1,NO_TITLE,"The speed and success of innovation processes could be enhanced with the involvement of a wider range of actors from the industry, research and financial communities working in partnerships at national, regional and international levels. Public policies play a critical role to bring together these different actors and create the necessary enabling conditions, including financial support, through different instruments as well as institutional and human capacities."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.2 | 	What can be done to promote innovation for climate change and the widespread diffusion of low-emission and climate-resilient technology?_p2,NO_TITLE,"The increasing complexity of technologies requires cooperation if their widespread diffusion is to be achieved. Cooperation includes the necessary knowledge flow within and between countries and regions. This knowledge flow can take the form of exchanging experiences, ideas, skills, and practices, among others."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.3 | 	What is the role of international technology cooperation in addressing climate change?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technologies that are currently known but not yet widely used need to be spread around the world, and adapted to local preferences and conditions. Innovation capabilities are required not only to adapt new technologies for local use, but also to create new markets and business models. International technology cooperation can serve that purpose."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.3 | 	What is the role of international technology cooperation in addressing climate change?_p2,NO_TITLE,"In fact, evidence shows that international cooperation on technology development and transfer can help developing countries to achieve their climate goals more effectively and, if this is done properly, can also help to addressing other sustainable development goals. Many initiatives exist both regionally and globally to help countries in achieving technology development and transfer through partnerships and research collaboration that include developed and developing countries, with a key role for technological institutions and universities. Enhancing current activities would help an effective, long-term global response to climate change, while promoting sustainable development."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.3 | 	What is the role of international technology cooperation in addressing climate change?_p3,NO_TITLE,"Globalisation of production and supply of goods and services, including innovation and new technologies, may open up opportunities for developing countries to advance technology diffusion; however, so far not all countries have benefitted from the globalisation of innovation due to different barriers, such as access to finance and technical capabilities. These asymmetries between countries in the globalisation process can also lead to dependencies on foreign knowledge and providers."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.3 | 	What is the role of international technology cooperation in addressing climate change?_p4,NO_TITLE,"Not all technology cooperation directly results in mitigation outcomes. Overall, technology transfer broadly has focused on enhancing climate technology absorption and deployment in developing countries as well as research, development and demonstration, and knowledge spillovers."
wg3_ch16_FAQ 16.3 | 	What is the role of international technology cooperation in addressing climate change?_p5,NO_TITLE,The Paris Agreement also reflects this view by noting that countries shall strengthen cooperative action on technology development and transfer regarding two main aspects: (i) promoting collaborative approaches to research and development; and (ii) facilitating access to technology to developing country Parties.
