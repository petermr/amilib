New and emerging cities will have significant infrastructure development needs to achieve high quality of life, which can be met through energy-efficient infrastructures and services, and people-centred urban design ( high confidence). The long lifespan of urban infrastructures locks in behaviour and committed emissions. Urban infrastructures and urban form can enable socio-cultural and lifestyle changes that can significantly reduce carbon footprints. Rapidly growing cities can avoid higher future emissions through urban planning to co-locate jobs and housing to achieve compact urban form, and by leapfrogging to low-carbon technologies. Established cities will achieve the largest GHG emissions savings by replacing, repurposing, or retrofitting the building stock, targeted infilling and densifying, as well as through modal shift and the electrification of the urban energy system. New and emerging cities have unparalleled potential to become low or net-zero GHG emissions while achieving high quality of life by creating compact, co-located, and walkable urban areas with mixed land use and transit-oriented design, that also preserve existing green and blue assets. {8.2, 8.4, 8.6}"

wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p1,City Climate Action ,The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was the first IPCC report that had a standalone chapter on urban mitigation of climate change. The starting point for that chapter was how the spatial organisation of urban settlements affects greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how urban form and infrastructure could facilitate mitigation of climate change. A main finding in AR5 was that urban form shapes urban energy consumption and GHG emissions.
wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p2,City Climate Action ,"Since AR5, there has been growing scientific literature and policy foci on urban strategies for climate change mitigation. There are three possible reasons for this. First, according to AR5 Working Group III (WGIII) Chapter 12 on Human Settlements, Infrastructure, and Spatial Planning, urban areas generate between 71% and 76% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from global final energy use and between 67% and 76% of global energy (Seto et al. 2014). Thus, focusing on ‘urban systems’ (see Annex I: Glossary and Figure 8.15) addresses one of the key drivers of emissions. Second, more than half of the world population lives in urban areas, and by mid-century 7 out of 10 people on the planet will live in a town or a city (UN DESA 2019). Thus, coming up with mitigation strategies that are relevant to urban settlements is critical for successful mitigation of climate change. Third, beyond climate change, there is growing attention on cities as major catalysts of change and to help achieve the objectives outlined in multiple international frameworks and assessments."
wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p4,City Climate Action ,"Cities are also gaining traction within the work of the IPCC. The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5 Chapter 4) identified four systems that urgently need to change in fundamental and transformative ways: urban infrastructure, land use and ecosystems, industry, and energy. Urban infrastructure was singled out but urban systems form a pivotal part of the other three systems requiring change (IPCC 2018a) (see ‘infrastructure’ in Glossary). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) identified cities not only as spatial units for land-based mitigation options but also places for managing demand for natural resources including food, fibre, and water (IPCC 2019)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p5,City Climate Action ,"Other international frameworks are highlighting the importance of cities. For example, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report on nature’s contribution to people is clear: cities straddle the biodiversity sphere in the sense that they present spatial units of ecosystem fragmentation and degradation while at the same time contain spatial units where the concentration of biodiversity compares favourably with some landscapes (IPBES 2019a). Cities are also featured as a key element in the transformational governance to tackle both climate change and biodiversity and ecosystem challenges in the first-ever IPCC-IPBES co-sponsored workshop report (Pörtner et al. 2021) (Section 8.5 and see ‘governance’ in Glossary)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p6,City Climate Action ,"The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) further underscore the importance of cities in the international arena with the inclusion of SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities for ‘inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ cities and human settlements (United Nations 2015; Queiroz et al. 2017; United Nations 2019). Additionally, UN-Habitat’s New Urban Agenda (NUA) calls for various measures, including integrated spatial planning at the city-regional scale, to address the systemic challenges included in greening cities, among which is emissions reduction and avoidance (United Nations 2017)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p7,City Climate Action ,"Since AR5, there has also been an increase in scientific literature on urban mitigation of climate change, including more diversity of mitigation strategies than were covered during AR5 (Lamb et al. 2018), as well as a growing focus on how strategies at the urban scale can have compounding or additive effects beyond urban areas (e.g., in rural areas, land-use planning, and the energy sector)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.1_p8,City Climate Action ,"There is more literature on using a systems approach to understand the interlinkages between mitigation and adaptation, and situating GHG emissions reduction targets within broader social, economic, and human well-being contexts and goals (Bai et al. 2018; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2021). In particular, the nexus approach, such as the water and energy nexus and the water-energy-food nexus, is increasingly being used to understand potential emissions and energy savings from cross-sectoral linkages that occur in cities (Wang and Chen 2016; Engström et al. 2017; Valek et al. 2017). There is also a growing literature that aims to quantify transboundary urban GHG emissions and carbon footprint beyond urban and national administrative boundaries (Chen et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2016). Such a scope provides a more complete understanding of how local urban emissions or local mitigation strategies can have effects on regions’ carbon footprint or GHG emissions."

wg3_ch08_8.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter takes an urban systems approach and covers the full range of urban settlements, including towns, cities, and metropolitan areas. By ‘urban system’ (Figure 8.15), this chapter refers to two related concepts. First, an urban systems approach recognises that cities do not function in isolation. Rather, cities exhibit strong interdependencies across scales, whether it is within a region, a country, a continent, or worldwide. Cities are embedded in broader ecological, economic, technical, institutional, legal, and governance structures that often constrain their systemic function, which cannot be separated from wider power relations (Bai et al. 2016)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"The notion of a system of cities has been around for nearly 100 years and recognises that cities are interdependent, in that significant changes in one city, such as economic activities, income, or population, will affect other cities in the system (Christaller 1933; Berry 1964; Marshall 1989). This perspective of an urban system emphasises the connections between a city and other cities, as well as between a city and its hinterlands (Hall and Hay 1980; Ramaswami et al. 2017b; Xu et al. 2018c). An important point is that growth in one city affects growth in other cities in the global, national or regional system of cities (Gabaix 1999; Scholvin et al. 2019; Knoll 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Moreover, there is a hierarchy of cities (Taylor 1997; Liu et al. 2014), with very large cities at the top of the hierarchy concentrating political power and financial resources, but of which there are very few. Rather, the urban system is dominated by small and medium-sized cities and towns. With globalisation and increased interconnectedness of financial flows, labour, and supply chains, cities across the world today have long-distance relationships on multiple dimensions but are also connected to their hinterlands for resources."
wg3_ch08_8.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The second key component of the urban systems lens identifies the activities and sectors within a city as being inter-connected – that cities are ecosystems (Rees 1997; Grimm et al. 2000; Newman and Jennings 2008; Acuto et al. 2019; Abdullah and Garcia-Chueca 2020; Acuto and Leffel 2021). This urban systems perspective emphasises linkages and interrelations within cities. The most evident example of this is urban form and infrastructure, which refer to the patterns and spatial arrangements of land use, transportation systems, and urban design. Changes in urban form and infrastructure can simultaneously affect multiple sectors, such as buildings, energy, and transport."
wg3_ch08_8.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"This chapter assesses urban systems beyond simply jurisdictional boundaries. Using an urban systems lens has the potential to accelerate mitigation beyond a single sector or purely jurisdictional approach (Section 8.4). An urban systems perspective presents both challenges and opportunities for urban mitigation strategies. It shows that any mitigation option potentially has positive or negative consequences in other sectors, other settlements, cities, or other parts of the world, and requires more careful and comprehensive considerations on the broader impacts, including equity and social justice (see Glossary for a comprehensive definition of ‘equity’ in the context of mitigation and adaptation). This chapter focuses on cities, city regions, metropolitan regions, megalopolitans, mega-urban regions, towns, and other types of urban configurations because they are the primary sources of urban GHG emissions and tend to be where mitigation action can be most impactful."
wg3_ch08_8.1.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"There is no internationally agreed upon definition of ‘urban’, ‘urban population’, or ‘urban area’. Countries develop their own definitions of urban, often based on a combination of population size or density, and other criteria including the percentage of population not employed in agriculture, the availability of electricity, piped water, or other infrastructures, and characteristics of the built environment, such as dwellings and built structures. This chapter assesses urban systems, which includes cities and towns. It uses a similar framework to Chapter 6 of AR6 WGII, referring to cities and urban settlements as ‘concentrated human habitation centres that exist along a continuum’ (Dodman et al. 2022) (for further definitions of ‘urban’, ‘cities’, ‘settlements’ and related terms, see Glossary, and WGII Chapter 6)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The 21st century will be the urban century, defined by a massive increase in global urban populations and a significant building up of new urban infrastructure stock to accommodate the growing urban population. Six trends in urbanisation are especially important in the context of climate change mitigation. 4 "
wg3_ch08_8.1.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"First, the size and relative proportion of the urban population is unprecedented and continues to increase. As of 2018, approximately 55% of the global population lives in urban areas (about 4.3 billion people) (UN DESA 2019). It is predicted that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. This will mean adding 2.5 billion people to urban areas between 2018 and 2050, with 90% of this increase taking place in Africa and Asia. There is a strong correlation between the level of urbanisation and the level of national income, with considerable variation and complexity in the relationship between the two (UN DESA 2019). In general, countries with levels of urbanisation of 75% or greater all have high national incomes, whereas countries with low levels of urbanisation under 35% have low national incomes (UN DESA 2019). In general, there is a clear positive correlation between the level of urbanisation and income levels (Figure 8.1 and Box 8.1)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Second, the geographic concentration of the world’s current urban population is in emerging economies, and the majority of future urban population growth will take place in developing countries and least-developed countries (LDCs). About half of the world’s urban population in 2018 lived in just seven countries, and about half of the increase in urban population through 2050 is projected to be concentrated in eight countries (UN DESA 2019) (Figure 8.2). Of these eight, seven are emerging economies where there will be a need for significant financing to construct housing, roads, and other urban infrastructure to accommodate the growth of the urban population. How these new cities of tomorrow will be designed and constructed will lock-in patterns of urban energy behaviour for decades if not generations (Sections 8.3.4 and 8.4). Thus, it is essential that urban climate change mitigation strategies include solutions appropriate for cities of varying sizes and typologies (Section 8.6 and Figure 8.21)."

In 2018, more than half (58%) of the urban population lived in cities and towns with fewer than 1 million inhabitants and almost half of the world’s urban population (48%) lived in settlements with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants (Figure 8.3). Although megacities receive a lot of attention, only about 13% of the urban population worldwide lived in a megacity – an urban area with at least 10 million inhabitants (UN DESA 2019). Thus, there is a need for a wide range of strategies for urban mitigation of climate change that are appropriate for cities of varying levels of development and size, especially smaller cities which often have lower levels of financial capacities than large cities."
wg3_ch08_8.1.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Fourth, another trend is the rise of megacities and extended metropolitan regions. The largest cities around the world are becoming even larger, and there is a growing divergence in economic power between megacities and other large cities (Kourtit et al. 2015; Hoornweg and Pope 2017; Zhao et al. 2017b). Moreover, there is evidence that the largest city in each country has an increasing share of the national population and economy."
wg3_ch08_8.1.4_p8,NO_TITLE,"Fifth, population declines have been observed for cities and towns across the world, including in Poland, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Germany, and Ukraine. The majority of cities that have experienced population declines are concentrated in Europe. Multiple factors contribute to the decline in cities, including declining industries and the economy, declining fertility, and outmigration to larger cities. Shrinking urban populations could offer retrofitting opportunities (UNEP 2019) and increasing greenspaces (Jarzebski et al. 2021), but the challenges for these cities differ in scope and magnitude from rapidly expanding cities."
wg3_ch08_8.1.4_p9,NO_TITLE,"Sixth, urbanisation in many emerging economies is characterised by informality and an informal economy (Brown and McGranahan 2016). The urban informal economy includes a wide array of activities, including but not limited to street vending, home-based enterprises, unreported income from self-employment, informal commerce, domestic service, waste-picking, and urban agriculture. The urban informal economy is large and growing. Globally, about 44% of the urban economy is informal, although there is much variation between countries and regions (ILO 2018). Emerging and developing economies have the highest percentage of the urban informal economy, with Africa (76%) and the Arab States (64%) with the largest proportion (ILO 2018). Urban informality also extends to planning, governance and institutions (Roy 2009; EU 2016; Lamson-Hall et al. 2019). Given its prevalence, it is important for urban climate change mitigation strategies to account for informality, especially in emerging and developing countries (Section 8.3.2)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urbanisation in the 21st century will be dominated by population and infrastructure growth in developing countries, and as such it is important to highlight three aspects that are unique and especially relevant for climate change mitigation. First, urbanisation will increase in speed and magnitude. Given their significant impact on emissions, mitigation action in Asian cities, especially the large and rapidly growing cities, will have significant implications on global ambitions (Section 8.3.4)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Second, a number of cities in developing countries lack institutional, financial and technical capacities to enable local climate change action (Sharifi et al. 2017; Fuhr et al. 2018). While these capacities differ across contexts (Hickmann et al. 2017), several governance challenges are similar across cities (Gouldson et al. 2015). These factors also influence the ability of cities to innovate and effectively implement mitigation action (Nagendra et al. 2018) (Chapter 17)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Third, there are sizable economic benefits in developing country cities that can provide an opportunity to enhance political momentum and institutions (Colenbrander et al. 2016). The co-benefits approach (Section 8.2), which frames climate objectives alongside other development benefits, is increasingly seen as an important concept justifying and driving climate change action in developing countries (Sethi and Puppim de Oliveira 2018)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Large-scale system transformations are also deeply influenced by factors outside governance and institutions, such as private interests and power dynamics (Jaglin 2014; Tyfield 2014). In some cases, these private interests are tied up with international flows of capital. In India, adaptation plans involving networks of private actors and related mitigation actions have resulted in the dominance of private interests. This has led to trade-offs and adverse impacts on the poor (Chu 2016; Mehta et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"When planning and implementing low-carbon transitions, it is important to consider the socio-economic context. An inclusive approach emphasises the need to engage non-state actors, including businesses, research organisations, non-profit organisations and citizens (Lee and Painter 2015; Hale et al. 2020). For example, engaging people in defining locally relevant mitigation targets and actions has enabled successful transformations in China (Engels 2018), Africa (Göpfert et al. 2019) and Malaysia (Ho et al. 2015). An active research and government collaboration through multiple stakeholder interactions in a large economic corridor in Malaysia led to the development and implementation of a low-carbon blueprint for the region (Ho et al. 2013). Many cities in LDCs and developing countries lack adequate urban infrastructure and housing. An equitable transformation in these cities entails prioritising energy access and basic services, including safe drinking water and sanitation, to meet basic needs of their populations."
wg3_ch08_8.1.6_p1,Urban Carbon Cycle ,"Urban areas concentrate GHG fluxes because of the size of the urban population, the size and nature of the urban economy, the energy and GHGs embodied in the infrastructure (see ‘embodied emissions’ in Glossary), and the goods and services imported and exported to and from cities (USGCRP 2018)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In cities, carbon cycles through natural (e.g., vegetation and soils) and managed (e.g., reservoirs and anthropogenic – buildings, transportation) pools. The accumulation of carbon in urban pools, such as buildings or landfills, results from the local or global transfer of carbon-containing energy and raw materials used in the city (Churkina 2008; Pichler et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2020b). Quantitative understanding of these transfers and the resulting emissions and uptake within an urban area is essential for accurate urban carbon accounting (USGCRP 2018). Currently, urban areas are a net source of carbon because they emit more carbon than they uptake. Thus, urban mitigation strategies require a twofold strategy: reducing urban emissions of carbon into the atmosphere, and enhancing uptake of carbon in urban pools (Churkina 2012) (for a broader definition of ‘carbon cycle’ and related terms such as ‘carbon sink,’ ‘carbon stock,’ ‘carbon neutrality,’ ‘GHG neutrality,’ and others, see Glossary)."
wg3_ch08_8.1.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Burning fossil fuels to generate energy for buildings, transportation, industry, and other sectors is a major source of urban GHG emissions (Gurney et al. 2015). At the same time, most cities do not generate within their boundaries all of the resources they use, such as electricity, gasoline, cement, water, and food needed for local homes and businesses to function (Jacobs 1969), requiring consideration of GHG emissions embodied in supply chains serving cities. Furthermore, urban vegetation, soils, and aquatic systems can both emit or remove carbon from the urban atmosphere and are often heavily managed. For example, urban parks, forests, and street trees actively remove carbon from the atmosphere through growing season photosynthesis. They can become a net source of carbon most often during the dormant season or heat waves. Some of the sequestered carbon can be stored in the biomass of urban trees, soils, and aquatic systems. Urban infrastructures containing cement also uptake carbon through the process of carbonation. The uptake of carbon by urban trees is at least two orders of magnitude faster than by cement-containing infrastructures (Churkina 2012) (Section 8.4.4 and Figures 8.17 and 8.18)."

Furthermore, accounting frameworks are reflected in multiple protocols used by urban practitioners (BSI 2013; Fong et al. 2014; ICLEI 2019b). Synthesis of these reviews and protocols, as well as the many individual methodological studies available, point to four general frameworks of urban GHG accounting: (i) territorial accounting (TA); (ii) community-wide infrastructure supply chain footprinting (CIF); and (iii and iv) consumption-based carbon footprint accounting (CBCF; Wiedmann and Minx 2008). The last, CBCF, can be further divided into accounting with a focus on household or personal consumption (iii: the personal carbon footprint, or PCF); and an approach in which one includes final consumption in an area by all consumers (iv: the areal carbon footprint, or ACF) (Heinonen et al. 2020). A number of small variations to these general categories are found in the literature (Lin et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2020a), but these four general frameworks capture the important distinctive (i.e., policy-relevant) features of urban GHG accounting."

wg3_ch08_8.1.6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"A key advance since AR5 lies in understanding the different GHG accounting frameworks in terms of what they imply for responsibility – shared or otherwise – and what they imply for the depth and breadth of GHG emission reductions. TA focuses on in-city direct emission of GHGs to the atmosphere (e.g., combustion, net ecosystem exchange, methane (CH4) leakage) within a chosen geographic area (Sovacool and Brown 2010; Gurney et al. 2019). CIF connects essential infrastructure use and demand activities in cities with their production, by combining TA emissions with the transboundary supply chain emissions associated with imported electricity, fuels, food, water, building materials, and waste management services used in cities (Ramaswami et al. 2008; Kennedy et al. 2009; Chavez and Ramaswami 2013)."

The distinction between the PCF and ACF variants of the CBCF is primarily associated with whether the agents responsible for the final demand are confined to only city residents (PCF) or all consumers in a city (ACF), which can include government consumers, capital formation, and other final demand categories (Heinonen et al. 2020)."

The CIF framework enables individual cities to connect community-wide demand for infrastructure and food with their transboundary production, strategically aligning their net-zero emissions plans with larger-scale net-zero efforts (Ramaswami and Chavez 2013; Ramaswami et al. 2021; Seto et al. 2021)."

Urban mitigation with a view of the SDGs can support shifting pathways of urbanisation towards greater sustainability. The feasibility of urban mitigation options is also malleable and can increase with more ‘enabling conditions’ (see Glossary), provided, perhaps, through institutional (i.e., financial or governmental) support (Section 8.5). Strengthened institutional capacity that supports the coordination of mitigation options can increase linkages with the SDGs and their synergies. For example, urban land use and spatial planning for walkable and co-located densities, together with electrification of the urban energy system, can hold more benefits for the SDGs than any one of the mitigation options alone (Sections 8.4.2.3, 8.4.3.1 and 8.6)."

Some measures, especially those related to land-use planning and transportation, have also increased opportunities for physical activity for improved health (Diallo et al. 2016). In developing countries, the co-benefits approach has been effective in justifying climate change mitigation actions at the local level (Puppim de Oliveira and Doll 2016). Mixed-use compact development with sufficient land-use diversity can have a positive influence on urban productivity (Section 8.4.2). Conversely, urban spatial structures that increase walking distances and produce car dependency have negative impacts on urban productivity considering congestion as well as energy costs (Salat et al. 2017)."

Measures such as renewable energy-based electrification of the energy system not only reduce outdoor air pollution, but also enhance indoor air quality by promoting smoke-free heating and cooking in buildings (Kjellstrom and McMichael 2013). The environmental and ecological benefits of electrification of the urban energy system include improved air quality based on a shift to non-polluting energy sources (Jacobson et al. 2018; Ajanovic and Haas 2019; Bagheri et al. 2019; Gai et al. 2020). Across 74 metropolitan areas around the world, an estimated 408,270 lives per year are saved due to air quality improvements that stem from a move to 100% renewable energy (Jacobson et al. 2020). Other studies indicate that there is potential to reduce premature mortality by up to 7000 people in 53 towns and cities, to create 93,000 new jobs, and to lower global climate costs and personal energy costs, through renewable energy transformations (Jacobson et al. 2018)."

Better air quality further reinforces the health co-benefits of climate mitigation measures based on walking and bicycling since evidence suggests that increased physical activity in urban outdoor settings with low levels of black carbon improves lung function (Laeremans et al. 2018). Physical activity can also be fostered through urban design measures and policies that promote the development of ample and well-connected parks and open spaces, and can lead to physical and mental health benefits (Kabisch et al. 2016) (Section 8.4.4 and Figure 8.18)."

Compact city policies and interventions that support a modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public transport delivers significant public health benefits (Creutzig 2016; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). Trade-offs associated with compact development include the marginal health costs of transport air pollution (Lohrey and Creutzig 2016) and stress from traffic noise (Gruebner et al. 2017) (Section 8.4.2.3)."

As a case-in-point, data from cities such as Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Manila, Beijing, Mexico City, Dakar, and Buenos Aires indicate that economic costs of congestion account for a considerable share of their gross domestic product (GDP), ranging from 0.7% to 15.0% (Dulal 2017) (Section 8.4.2)."

Anti-sprawl policies that aim to increase density, or the introduction of large green areas in cities could increase property prices, resulting in trade-offs with affordable housing and pushing urban poor further away from cities (Reckien et al. 2017; Alves et al. 2019). Deliberate strategies can improve access of low-income populations to jobs, and gender-responsive transport systems that can enhance women’s mobility and financial independence (Viguié and Hallegatte 2012; Lecompte and Juan Pablo 2017; Reckien et al. 2017; Priya Uteng and Turner 2019)."

Sustainable and low-carbon urban development that integrates issues of equity, inclusivity, and affordability while safeguarding urban livelihoods, providing access to basic services, lowering energy bills, addressing energy poverty, and improving public health, can also improve the distributional effects of existing and future urbanisation (Friend et al. 2016; Claude et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2018; Mrówczyńska et al. 2018; Pukšec et al. 2018; Wiktorowicz et al. 2018; Ramaswami 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Depending on the context, green and blue infrastructure can also offer considerable economic co-benefits. For example, green roofs and facades and other urban greening efforts such as urban agriculture and greening streets can improve microclimatic conditions and enhance thermal comfort, thereby reducing utility and health care costs. The presence of green and blue infrastructure may also increase the economic values of nearby properties (Votsis 2017; Alves et al. 2019) (Section 8.4.4 and Figure 8.18)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Studies in the UK show that beneficiaries are willing to pay (WTP) an additional fee (up to 2% more in monthly rent) for proximity to green and blue infrastructure, with the WTP varying depending on the size and nature of the green space (Mell et al. 2013, 2016). Urban agriculture can not only reduce household food expenditure, but also provide additional sources of revenue for the city (Ayerakwa 2017; Alves et al. 2019). Based on the assessed literature, there is  high agreement  on the economic co-benefits of green and blue infrastructure, but supporting evidence is still limited (Section 8.7)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Implementing waste management and wastewater recycling measures can provide additional sources of income for citizens and local authorities. Wastewater recycling can minimise the costs associated with the renewal of centralised wastewater treatment plants (Bernstad Saraiva Schott and Cánovas 2015; Gharfalkar et al. 2015; Gonzalez-Valencia et al. 2016; Herrero and Vilella 2018; Matsuda et al. 2018; Nisbet et al. 2019). Waste management and wastewater recycling is also a pathway for inclusion of the informal sector into the urban economy with  high agreement  and medium evidence (Sharifi 2021). Additionally, authorities can sell energy generated from wastewater recycling to compensate for the wastewater management costs (Colenbrander et al. 2017; Gondhalekar and Ramsauer 2017). Another measure that contributes to reducing household costs is the promotion of behavioural measures such as dietary changes that can decrease the demand for costly food sources and reduce health care costs through promoting healthy diets (Hoppe et al. 2016) (Sections 8.4.5 and 8.4.6)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"In addition to cost savings, various measures such as stormwater management and urban greening can enhance social equity and environmental justice. For example, the thermal comfort benefits provided by green and blue infrastructure and passive design measures can address issues related to energy poverty and unaffordability of expensive air conditioning systems for some social groups (Sharma et al. 2018; He et al. 2019). To achieve such benefits, however, the costs of integrating green and blue infrastructure and passive design measures into building design would need to be minimised. Another example is the flood mitigation benefits of stormwater management measures that can reduce impacts on urban poor who often reside in flood-prone and low-lying areas of cities (Adegun 2017; He et al. 2019). Generally, the urban poor are expected to be disproportionately affected by climate change impacts. Carefully designed measures that reduce such disproportionate impacts by involving experts, authorities and citizens would enhance social equity (Pandey et al. 2018; He et al. 2019; Mulligan et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"There are numerous synergies that come from coupling urban adaptation and mitigation. A number of studies have developed methods to assess the synergies between mitigation and adaptation strategies, as well as their co-benefits (Solecki et al. 2015; Buonocore et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2017; Helgenberger and Jänicke 2017). Co-benefits occur when implementing mitigation (or adaptation) measures that have positive effects on adaptation (or mitigation) (Sharifi 2021). In contrast, the trade-offs emerge when measures aimed at improving mitigation (adaptation) undermine the ability to pursue adaptation (mitigation) targets (Sharifi 2020). The magnitude of such co-benefits and trade-offs may vary depending on various factors. A systematic review of over 50 climate change articles provides evidence that mitigation can contribute to resilience – especially to temperature changes and flooding – with varying magnitudes, depending on factors such as the type of mitigation measure and the scale of implementation (Sharifi 2019)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Measures from different sectors that can provide both mitigation and adaptation benefits involve urban planning (Section 8.4.2), buildings (Sections 8.4.3.2 and 8.4.4), energy (Section 8.4.3), green and blue infrastructure (Section 8.4.4), transportation (Section 8.4.2), socio-behavioural aspects (Section 8.4.5), urban governance (Section 8.5), waste (Section 8.4.5.2), and water (Section 8.4.6). In addition to their energy-saving and carbon-sequestration benefits, many measures can also enhance adaptation to climate threats, such as extreme heat, energy shocks, floods, and droughts (Sharifi 2021). Existing evidence is mainly related to urban green infrastructure, urban planning, transportation, and buildings. There has been more emphasis on the potential co-benefits of measures, such as proper levels of density, building energy efficiency, distributed and decentralised energy infrastructure, green roofs and facades, and public/active transport modes. Renewable-based distributed and decentralised energy systems improve resilience to energy shocks and can enhance adaptation to water stress considering the water-energy nexus. By further investment on these measures, planners and decision makers can ensure enhancing achievement of mitigation/adaptation co-benefits at the urban level (Sharifi 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"As for trade-offs, some mitigation efforts may increase exposure to stressors such as flooding and the urban heat island (UHI) effect (see Glossary), thereby reducing the adaptive capacity of citizens. For instance, in some contexts, high-density areas that lack adequate provision of green and open spaces may intensify the UHI effect (Pierer and Creutzig 2019; Xu et al. 2019). There are also concerns that some mitigation efforts may diminish adaptive capacity of urban poor and marginalised groups through increasing costs of urban services and/or eroding livelihood options. Environmental policies designed to meet mitigation targets through phasing out old vehicles may erode livelihood options of poor households, thereby decreasing their adaptive capacity (Colenbrander et al. 2017). Ambitious mitigation and adaptation plans could benefit private corporate interests resulting in adverse effects on the urban poor (Chu et al. 2018; Mehta et al. 2019)."

Between 2000 and 2015, the global population in locations that were affected by floods grew by 58–86 million (Tellman et al. 2021). The direct economic costs of all extreme events reached USD210–268 billion in 2020 (Aon 2021; Munich RE 2021; WMO 2021) or about USD0.7 billion per day; this figure does not include knock-on costs in supply chains (Kii 2020) or lost days of work, implying that the actual economic costs could be far higher. Depending on RCP, between half (RCP2.6) and three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Mora et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2019) (see WGII Section 6.2.2.1, WGII Figure 6.3, and WGIII Sections 8.2 and 8.3.4)."

Particularly in larger cities, this climate feedback is exacerbated by local choices in urban design, land use, building design, and human behaviour (Viguié et al. 2020) that shape local environmental conditions. Both the local and global combine to increase hazardousness.

Retrofitting, disaster reconstruction, and urban regeneration programmes offer scope for strategic direction changes to low-carbon and high-resilience urban form and function, so long as they are inclusive in design and implementation. Rapid urban growth means new investment, new buildings and infrastructure, new demands for energy and transport and new questions about what a healthy and fulfilling urban life can be. The USD90 trillion expected to be invested in new urban development by 2030 (NCE 2018) is a global opportunity to place adaptation and mitigation directly into urban infrastructure and planning, as well as to consider social policy including education, health care, and environmental management (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018).

Sharing expertise can build on existing regional and global networks, many of which have already placed knowledge, learning, and capacity building at the centre of their agendas.

Local actors are providers of infrastructure and services, regulators of zoning, and can be conveners and champions of an integrated approach for mitigation and adaptation at multiple levels (limited evidence,  high confidence). New opportunities in governance and finance can enable cities to pool resources together and aggregate interventions to innovate ways of mobilising urban climate finance at scale (Colenbrander et al. 2019; Simpson et al. 2019; White and Wahba 2019). However, research increasingly points towards the difficulties faced during the implementation of climate financing in situ, such as the fragmentation of structures of governance capable of managing large investments effectively (Mohammed et al. 2019) (see WGIII Section 8.5 and WGIII Chapter 13)."
wg3_ch08_cross-working-group-box-2:-cities-and-climate-change_p28,NO_TITLE,"Scaling up transformative place-based action for both adaptation and mitigation requires enabling conditions, including land-based financing, intermediaries, and local partnerships (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Chu et al. 2019; Chaudhuri, 2020) supported by a new generation of big data approaches. Governance structures that combine actors working at different levels with a different mix of tools are effective in addressing challenges related to implementation of integrated action while cross-sectoral coordination is necessary (Singh et al. 2020). Joint institutionalisation of mitigation and adaptation in local governance structures can also enable integrated action (Göpfert et al. 2020; Hurlimann et al. 2021). However, the proportion of international finance that reaches local recipients remains low, despite the repeated focus of climate policy on place-based adaptation and mitigation (Manuamorn et al. 2020). Green financing instruments that enable local climate action without exacerbating current forms of inequality can jointly address mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development. Climate finance that also reaches beyond larger non-state enterprises (e.g., small and medium-sized enterprises, local communities, or non-governmental organisations (NGOs)), and is inclusive in responding to the needs of all urban inhabitants (e.g., disabled individuals, or citizens of different races or ethnicities) is essential for inclusive and resilient urban development (Colenbrander et al. 2019; Gabaldón-Estevan et al. 2019; Frenova 2021).

New constellations of responsible actors are required to manage hybrid local-city or cross-city risk management and decarbonisation initiatives (limited evidence, medium agreement ).

Urban land expansion to accommodate a growing urban population has resulted in the conversion of agricultural land (Pandey et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019), deforestation (van Vliet 2019), habitat fragmentation (Liu et al. 2016b), biodiversity loss (McDonald et al. 2018, 2020), and the modification of urban temperatures and regional precipitation patterns (Li et al. 2017; Krayenhoff et al. 2018; Liu and Niyogi 2019; Zhang et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Urban land use and the associated built environment and infrastructure shape urban GHG emissions through the demand for materials and the ensuing energy-consuming behaviours. In particular, the structure of the built environment (i.e., its density, form, and extent) have long-lasting influence on urban GHG emissions, especially those from transport and building energy use, as well as the embodied emissions of the urban infrastructure (Butler et al. 2014; Salat et al. 2014; Ramaswami et al. 2016; Seto et al. 2016; d’Amour et al. 2017). Thus, understanding trends in urban land use is essential for assessing energy behaviour in cities as well as long-term mitigation potential (Sections 8.4 and 8.6, and Figure 8.21)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"This section draws on the literature to discuss three key trends in urban land expansion, and how those relate to GHG emissions."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"First, urban land areas are growing rapidly all around the world. From 1975 to 2015, urban settlements expanded in size approximately 2.5 times, accounting for 7.6% of the global land area (Pesaresi et al. 2016). Nearly 70% of the total urban expansion between 1992 and 2015 occurred in Asia and North America (Liu et al. 2020a). By 2015, the extent of urban and built-up lands was between 0.5% and 0.6% of the total 130 Mkm 2 global ice-free land use, taking up other uses such as fertile cropland and natural ecosystems."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Second, as Figure 8.5 shows, urban population densities are declining, with significant implications for GHG emissions. From 1970 to 2010, while the global urban settlement extent doubled in size (Pesaresi et al. 2016), most regions (grouped by the AR6 WGIII 10-region aggregation) exhibited a trend of decreasing urban population densities, suggesting expansive urban growth patterns. Urban population densities have consistently declined in Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and Europe, North America, and Southern Asia regions, across all city sizes. North America consistently had the lowest urban population densities. Notably, the Middle East region appears to be the only region exhibiting an overall increasing trend across all city-size groups, while Latin America and Caribbean appears to be relatively stable for all city sizes. While the larger cities in Africa and South-East Asia and Pacific exhibit slightly stable urban population densities, the small and medium-sized cities in those regions trend toward lower urban population densities. In large urban centres of Eastern Asia and North America, rapid decreases in earlier decades seem to have tapered. Compared to larger cities, small-medium urban areas with populations of less than 2 million have more declines in urban population densities and higher rates of urban land expansion (Güneralp et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"This decline in urban densities is paralleled by an increase in ‘sprawl’, or ‘outward’ urban development. Urban expansion occurs in either one of three dimensions: (i) outward in a horizontal manner; (ii) upward, by way of vertical growth; or (iii) infill development, where unused, abandoned, or underutilised lands within existing urban areas are developed or rehabilitated (Figure 8.20). Outward expansion results in more urban land area and occurs at the expense of other land uses (i.e., the conversion and loss of cropland or forests). Vertical expansion results in more multi-storey buildings and taller buildings, more floor space per area, and an increase in urban built-up density. Every city has some combination of outward and upward growth in varying degrees (Mahtta et al. 2019) (Figure 8.6). That each city is comprised of different and multiple urban growth typologies suggests the need for differentiated mitigation strategies for different parts of a single city (Section 8.6 and Figure 8.21). Recent research shows that the relative combination of outward versus upward growth is a reflection of its economic and urban development (Lall et al. 2021). That is, how a city grows – whether upward or outward – is a function of its economic development level. Upward growth, or more tall buildings, is a reflection of higher land prices (Ahlfeldt and McMillen 2018; Ahlfeldt and Barr 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"An analysis of 478 cities with populations of more than 1 million people found that the predominant urban growth pattern worldwide is outward expansion, suggesting that cities are becoming more expansive than dense (Mahtta et al. 2019) (Figure 8.6). The study also found that cities within a geographic region exhibit remarkably similar patterns of urban growth. Some studies have found a mix of urban forms emerging around the world; an analysis of 194 cities identified an overall trend (from 1990 to 2015) toward urban forms that are a mixture of fragmented and compact (Lemoine-Rodriguez et al. 2020). The exception to this trend is a group of large cities in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States that are still predominantly fragmented. The same study also identified small to medium-sized cities as the most dynamic in terms of their expansion and change in their forms."
wg3_ch08_8.3.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"A third trend in is urban land growth taking place on agricultural land, carbon stocks, and other land uses (see ‘carbon stock’ and ‘AFOLU’ – agriculture, forestry, and other land uses – in Glossary). As Figure 8.7 shows, over 60% of the reported urban expansion (nearly 40,000 km 2) from 1970 to 2010 was formerly agricultural land (Güneralp et al. 2020). This percentage increased to about 70% for global urban expansion that occurred between 1992 and 2015, followed by grasslands (about 12%) and forests (about 9%) (Liu et al. 2020a). In terms of percent of total urban land expansion, the largest conversion of agricultural lands to urban land uses from 1970 to 2010 took place in the Eastern Asia, and South-East Asia and Pacific regions; the largest proportional losses of natural land cover were reported for the North America and Australia, Japan and New Zealand regions (Güneralp et al. 2020). At a sub-regional level, agricultural land constituted the largest proportion of land converted to urban areas in China, India, Europe, Southeast Asian countries and the central United States between 1995 and 2015; in the eastern United States, most new urban land was converted from forests (Liu et al. 2020a). Urban expansion through 2040 may lead to the loss of almost 65 Mt of crop production – a scenario that underscores the ongoing relationship between urbanisation and AFOLU (van Vliet et al. 2017) (Chapter 7)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"About 880 million people currently live in informal settlements – defined as unplanned areas operating outside of legal and regulatory systems, where residents have no legal claim over their property and have inadequate basic services and infrastructure (United Nations 2018). Furthermore, upgrading informal settlements and inadequate housing is essential for improving resilience to climate change and well-being. Given the ubiquity of informal settlements in developing countries and LDCs, there is potential to harness informality to accelerate transitions to low-carbon urban development. There are several key reasons for their potential to mitigate GHG emissions. First, informal urban areas may not require large investments in retrofitting as they have developed with minimal investment in large-scale infrastructure. Second, these areas exhibit flexibility of development and can potentially be transformed into an urban form that supports low- or carbon-neutral infrastructure for transportation, energy use in residential buildings, and other sectors (Baurzhan and Jenkins 2016; Henneman et al. 2016; Byrne et al. 2017; Oyewo et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Informal urban areas can avoid the conventional trajectory of urban development by utilising large-scale strategies, such as micro-scale technologies, modal shifts towards compact, walkable urban form, as well as decentralised or meso-scale utilities of water, sanitation, and service centres – thereby mitigating emissions associated with transport and treating wastes (Tongwane et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2018). Some specific mitigation options include spatial adjustments for walkability of neighbourhoods, low-energy-intensive mobility, low-energy-intensive residential areas, low-carbon energy sources at city scale, off-grid utilities, and electrification and enhancement of the urban ecology – all of which have multiple potential benefits (Colenbrander et al. 2017; Fang et al. 2017; Laramee et al. 2018; van der Zwaan et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2018; Silveti and Andersson 2019). Some of the co-benefits of the various mitigation options include more job opportunities and business start-ups, increased incomes, air quality improvement, and enhanced health and well-being (Gebreegziabher et al. 2014; Dagnachew et al. 2018; Keramidas et al. 2018; Adams et al. 2019; Ambole et al. 2019; Boltz et al. 2019; Moncada et al. 2019; Weimann and Oni 2019; Manga et al. 2020) (Section 8.2)."

These technologies can be applied in the short term as responses with long-term influence on emissions reduction. The cumulative impact of the disruptive technologies can reduce emissions by 15–25% through enhanced emissions sinks in small and medium-sized cities (Tongwane et al. 2015; du Toit et al. 2018; Nero et al. 2018, 2019; Frantzeskaki et al. 2019; Mantey and Sakyi 2019; Singh and G. 2019)."

This innovation provides, for the first time, a temporal dimension to urban footprints considering different climate scenarios with implications for urban mitigation. The new analysis presents a comparison of ways urban emissions can evolve given different scenario contexts (Section 8.3.4.2). Additionally, new research has quantified trends in urban CO2 emissions and their key drivers across 91 global cities from 2000 to 2018 (Luqman et al. 2021)."

This estimate includes all CO2 and CH4 emissions except aviation, shipping, and biogenic sources (i.e., land-use change, forestry, and agriculture). About 100 of the highest-emitting urban areas account for approximately 18% of the global carbon footprint (Moran et al. 2018). Globally, the urban share of national CO2-eq emissions increased 6 percentage points, from 56% in 2000 to 62% in 2015."
wg3_ch08_8.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Second, while urban CO2 emissions were increasing in all urban areas, the dominant drivers were dependent upon development level. Emissions growth in urban areas other than in Developed Countries was driven by increases in area and per capita emissions. Across all cities, higher population densities are correlated with lower per capita GHG emissions (Luqman et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Third, the urban share of regional GHG emissions increased between 2000 and 2015, with much inter-region variation in the magnitude of the increase ( high confidence) (Figure 8.9).

Urban per capita CO2-eq and national per capita CO2-eq also increased in all regions except for the urban per capita CO2-eq value in the Developed Countries region, which declined slightly."
wg3_ch08_8.3.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Fourth, the global average per capita urban GHG emissions increased between 2000 and 2015, with cities in the Developed Countries region producing nearly seven times more per capita than the lowest emitting region (medium confidence). From 2000 to 2015, the global urban GHG emissions per capita increased from 5.5 to 6.2 tCO2-eq per person (an increase of 11.8%), with increases across five of the six regions: Africa increased from 1.3 to 1.5 tCO2-eq per person (22.6%); Asia and Pacific increased from 3.0 to 5.1 tCO2-eq per person (71.7%); Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia increased from 6.9 to 9.8 tCO2-eq per person (40.9%); Latin America and Caribbean increased from 2.7 to 3.7 tCO2-eq per person (40.4%); and the Middle East increased from 7.4 to 9.6 tCO2-eq per person (30.1%).

wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,Four overarching findings can be gleaned from these studies.
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"First, urban land areas will expand significantly by 2050 – by as much as 211% (see SSP5 forecast in Huang et al. 2019), but likely within a large potential range of about 43–106% over the 2015 extent by 2050 – to accommodate the growing urban population (Table 8.1). Globally, there are large uncertainties and variations among the studies – and between the SSPs – about the rates and extent of future urban expansion, owing to uncertainties about economic development and population growth (ranges of estimates are provided in Table 8.1). Overall, the largest urban extents are forecasted under SSP5 (fossil fuel-intensive development) for both 2050 and 2100, whereas the smallest forecasted urban extents are under SSP3 (‘regional rivalry’). Forecasted global urban extents could reach between 1 and 2.2 million km 2 (median of 1.4 million km 2, a 106% increase) in 2050 under SSP5, and between 0.85 and 1.5 million km 2 (median of 1 million km 2, a 43% increase) in 2050 under SSP3. Under SSP1, which is characterised by a focus on sustainability with more compact, low-emissions development, urban extents could reach 1 million km 2 (range of 0.9 to 2 million km 2, a 49% increase) in 2050. By 2100, the forecasted urban extents reach between 1.4 and 3.6 million km 2 (median 2.5 million km 2) under SSP5 and between 1 and 1.5 million km 2 (median 1.3 million km 2) under SSP3. Across the studies, substantially larger amounts of urban land expansion are expected after 2050 under SSP5 compared to other SSPs."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Second, there is a wide variation in estimates of urban land expansion across regions (using the AR6 WGIII 6-region aggregation). Across all four sets of forecasts, current urban land (circa 2015) is the largest in Developed Countries and in the Asia and Pacific region, with approximately two-thirds of the current urban extent occurring in those two regions (Table 8.1 and Figure 8.10). The largest increases in urban land by 2050 are expected in the Asia and Pacific and Developed Countries regions, across all the SSPs. However, the rate of increase in urban land in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, and the Middle East is significant and urban land could more than double by 2050. One-third of the studies conclude that the United States, China, and India will experience continued urban land expansion at least until 2050 (Huang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019b). However, Li et al. (2019) report that, after 2050, China could experience a decrease in the rate of urban land expansion, while growth will continue for India. This is not surprising since India’s urban demographic transition will only get underway after the middle of the century, when the urban population is expected to exceed the rural population. In contrast, China’s urban demographic transition could be nearly complete by 2050."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Third, in spite of these general trends, there are differences in forecasted urban expansion in each region across the SSPs and studies, with Huang et al. (2019) forecasting the most future urban land expansion between 2015 and 2050. The range across studies is significant. Under SSP1, urban land areas could increase by between 69,000 and 459,000 km 2 in Developed Countries, 77,000–417,000 km 2 in Asia and Pacific, and 28,000–216,000 km 2 in Africa. Under SSP3, where urban land expansion is forecasted to be the lowest, urban land areas could increase by between 23,000 and 291,000 km 2 in Developed Countries, 57,000–168,000 km 2 in Asia and Pacific, and 16,000–149,000 km 2 in Africa. Under SSP5, where urban land expansion is forecasted to be the highest, urban land area could increase by between 129,000 and 573,000 km 2 in Developed Countries, 83,000–472,000 km 2 in Asia and Pacific, and 40,000–222,000 km 2 in Africa (Huang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019b; Chen et al. 2020a; Gao and O’Neill 2020). By 2100, however, the Developed Countries region is expected to have the most urban expansion only in SSP5. In SSP2 and SSP4, the Developed Countries and Asia and Pacific regions have about equal amounts of new urban land; in SSP3, Asia and Pacific has more new urban land forecasted."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Fourth, both the range of estimates and their implications on land-use competition and urban life point to an opportunity for urban areas to consider their urban form when developing. Under the current urbanisation trajectory, 50–63% of newly expanded urban areas are expected to occur on current croplands (Chen et al. 2020a). However, there is significant regional variation; between 2000 and 2040, 12.5% of cropland in China and 7.5% of cropland in the Middle East and North Africa could potentially be displaced due to urban expansion, compared to the world average of 3.7% (van Vliet et al. 2017). As urban clusters increase in size and greenspace is converted, future urban land expansion is expected to intensify UHIs and exacerbate night-time extreme temperatures. An urban footprint increase of 78–171% by 2050 over the urban footprint in 2015 is expected to result in average summer daytime and night-time warming in air temperature of 0.5°C–0.7°C, even up to about 3°C in certain locations (Huang et al. 2019). Furthermore, this urban expansion-induced warming is on average about half – and in certain locations nearly twice – as strong as warming that will be caused by GHG emissions based on the multi-model ensemble average forecasts in RCP4.5. In short, future urban expansion will amplify the background warming caused by GHG emissions, with extreme warming most pronounced during night-time (very high confidence) (Huang et al. 2019). These findings corroborate those in the Technical Summary of AR6 WGI (Arias et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"The forecasted amounts and patterns of urban expansion presented here bear significant uncertainty due to underlying factors beyond mere methodological differences between the studies. These factors include potential changes in the social, economic, and institutional dynamics that drive urban land development across the world (Güneralp and Seto 2013). Some of these changes may come in the form of sudden shocks such as another global economic crisis or pandemic. The forecasts presented here do not take such factors into account."

This dearth of research rests on limited urban emissions data that are consistent and comparable across the globe, making review and synthesis challenging (Creutzig et al. 2016b). Some research has presented urban emissions forecasts and related projections, including estimated urban energy use in 2050 (Creutzig et al. 2015), energy savings for low-carbon development (Creutzig et al. 2016b), emission savings from existing and new infrastructure (Creutzig et al. 2016a) (Figure 8.12), and urban emissions from buildings, transport, industry, and agriculture (IEA 2016a)."

Starting in 2015 with a global urban emissions total of almost 14 GtCO2-eq, the study projects an increase to 17.3 GtCO2-eq by 2050 – but this reduces to 1.8 GtCO2-eq by 2050 with the inclusion of mitigation wedges: 58% from buildings, 21% from transport, 15% materials efficiency, and 5% waste, with decarbonisation of electricity supply as a cross-cutting strategy across the wedges."

Different scopes of analysis between sectors, as well as limited knowledge of the impact of existing and new urban infrastructure, limit the possibility of direct comparisons in emissions. Still, the shares of urban mitigation potential ranges between 77.7% and 78.9% for combined strategies that involve decarbonised buildings and transport in urban infrastructure, and the wedges approach the remaining emissions reductions also considering construction materials and waste.

By 2050, with moderate to low urban mitigation efforts, urban emissions are projected to rise to 34.0 GtCO2-eq (SSP2-RCP4.5) or 40.2 GtCO2-eq (SSP3-RCP7.0) – driven by growing urban population, infrastructure, and service demands. However, scenarios that involve rapid urbanisation can have different outcomes as seen in SSP1-RCP1.9 based on green growth, versus SSP5-RCP8.5 with the strongest carbon lock-in lacking any decarbonisation. Other scenarios involve mixed and/or low urbanisation, along with other differences, including the implementation of electrification, energy, and material efficiency, technology development and innovation, renewable energy preferences, and behavioural, lifestyle, and dietary responses (Table 8.2). With aggressive and immediate mitigation efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, urban GHG emissions could approach net-zero and reach a maximum of 3.3 GtCO2-eq in 2050 (SSP1-RCP1.9).

Pathways that are compliant with the Paris Agreement include such urban implications as a reversal of decreasing land-use efficiency in urban areas to lower energy demand based on spatial planning for compact urban form (Section 8.4.2), changes in urban infrastructure for supporting demand flexibility to handle variable energy supply (Section 8.4.3), as well as policies and governance that are conducive to innovation in urban areas (Section 8.5). Spatial planning for compact urban form can enable reduced energy demand and changes in service provisioning, including through walkable neighbourhoods and mixed land use, providing venues for socio-behavioural change towards active transport (Section 8.4.5).

wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,Four overarching findings can be gleaned from these studies.
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"First, urban land areas will expand significantly by 2050 – by as much as 211% (see SSP5 forecast in Huang et al. 2019), but likely within a large potential range of about 43–106% over the 2015 extent by 2050 – to accommodate the growing urban population (Table 8.1). Globally, there are large uncertainties and variations among the studies – and between the SSPs – about the rates and extent of future urban expansion, owing to uncertainties about economic development and population growth (ranges of estimates are provided in Table 8.1). Overall, the largest urban extents are forecasted under SSP5 (fossil fuel-intensive development) for both 2050 and 2100, whereas the smallest forecasted urban extents are under SSP3 (‘regional rivalry’). Forecasted global urban extents could reach between 1 and 2.2 million km 2 (median of 1.4 million km 2, a 106% increase) in 2050 under SSP5, and between 0.85 and 1.5 million km 2 (median of 1 million km 2, a 43% increase) in 2050 under SSP3. Under SSP1, which is characterised by a focus on sustainability with more compact, low-emissions development, urban extents could reach 1 million km 2 (range of 0.9 to 2 million km 2, a 49% increase) in 2050. By 2100, the forecasted urban extents reach between 1.4 and 3.6 million km 2 (median 2.5 million km 2) under SSP5 and between 1 and 1.5 million km 2 (median 1.3 million km 2) under SSP3. Across the studies, substantially larger amounts of urban land expansion are expected after 2050 under SSP5 compared to other SSPs."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Second, there is a wide variation in estimates of urban land expansion across regions (using the AR6 WGIII 6-region aggregation). Across all four sets of forecasts, current urban land (circa 2015) is the largest in Developed Countries and in the Asia and Pacific region, with approximately two-thirds of the current urban extent occurring in those two regions (Table 8.1 and Figure 8.10). The largest increases in urban land by 2050 are expected in the Asia and Pacific and Developed Countries regions, across all the SSPs. However, the rate of increase in urban land in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, and the Middle East is significant and urban land could more than double by 2050. One-third of the studies conclude that the United States, China, and India will experience continued urban land expansion at least until 2050 (Huang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019b). However, Li et al. (2019) report that, after 2050, China could experience a decrease in the rate of urban land expansion, while growth will continue for India. This is not surprising since India’s urban demographic transition will only get underway after the middle of the century, when the urban population is expected to exceed the rural population. In contrast, China’s urban demographic transition could be nearly complete by 2050."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Third, in spite of these general trends, there are differences in forecasted urban expansion in each region across the SSPs and studies, with Huang et al. (2019) forecasting the most future urban land expansion between 2015 and 2050. The range across studies is significant. Under SSP1, urban land areas could increase by between 69,000 and 459,000 km 2 in Developed Countries, 77,000–417,000 km 2 in Asia and Pacific, and 28,000–216,000 km 2 in Africa. Under SSP3, where urban land expansion is forecasted to be the lowest, urban land areas could increase by between 23,000 and 291,000 km 2 in Developed Countries, 57,000–168,000 km 2 in Asia and Pacific, and 16,000–149,000 km 2 in Africa. Under SSP5, where urban land expansion is forecasted to be the highest, urban land area could increase by between 129,000 and 573,000 km 2 in Developed Countries, 83,000–472,000 km 2 in Asia and Pacific, and 40,000–222,000 km 2 in Africa (Huang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019b; Chen et al. 2020a; Gao and O’Neill 2020). By 2100, however, the Developed Countries region is expected to have the most urban expansion only in SSP5. In SSP2 and SSP4, the Developed Countries and Asia and Pacific regions have about equal amounts of new urban land; in SSP3, Asia and Pacific has more new urban land forecasted."
wg3_ch08_8.3.4.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Fourth, both the range of estimates and their implications on land-use competition and urban life point to an opportunity for urban areas to consider their urban form when developing. Under the current urbanisation trajectory, 50–63% of newly expanded urban areas are expected to occur on current croplands (Chen et al. 2020a). However, there is significant regional variation; between 2000 and 2040, 12.5% of cropland in China and 7.5% of cropland in the Middle East and North Africa could potentially be displaced due to urban expansion, compared to the world average of 3.7% (van Vliet et al. 2017). As urban clusters increase in size and greenspace is converted, future urban land expansion is expected to intensify UHIs and exacerbate night-time extreme temperatures. An urban footprint increase of 78–171% by 2050 over the urban footprint in 2015 is expected to result in average summer daytime and night-time warming in air temperature of 0.5°C–0.7°C, even up to about 3°C in certain locations (Huang et al. 2019). Furthermore, this urban expansion-induced warming is on average about half – and in certain locations nearly twice – as strong as warming that will be caused by GHG emissions based on the multi-model ensemble average forecasts in RCP4.5.

In addition, the outward expansion of urban land areas often results in the conversion and loss of agricultural land (Pandey et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019), forests (Austin et al. 2019), and other vegetated areas, thereby reducing carbon uptake and storage (Quesada et al. 2018) (Section 8.3.1).

There is some evidence that the benefits of higher urban densities on reducing per capita urban GHG emissions may be offset by higher incomes, smaller household sizes, and, most importantly, higher consumption levels, thus creating a counter-effect that could increase GHG emissions with urbanisation (Gill and Moeller 2018)."
wg3_ch08_box-8.1:-does-urbanisation-drive-emissions?_p4,NO_TITLE,"Many studies have shown that the relationship between urbanisation and GHG emissions is dependent on the level and stage of urban development, and follows an inverted U-shaped relationship of the environmental Kuznets curve (Wang et al. 2016, 2022; Zhang et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018a; Zhou et al. 2019) (Sections 8.3.1 and 8.6, and Figure 8.20). Considering existing trends, earlier phases of urbanisation accompanied by rapid industrialisation, development of secondary industries, and high levels of economic growth, are correlated with higher levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions. However, more mature phases of urbanisation, with higher levels of economic development and establishment of the service sector, are correlated with lower levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions (Khan and Su 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urban mitigation options can be categorised into three broad strategies: (i) reducing or changing urban energy and material use towards more sustainable production and consumption across all sectors, including through spatial planning and infrastructure; (ii) electrification and switching to net-zero-emissions resources; and (iii) enhancing carbon storage in the urban environment through urban green and blue infrastructure, which can also offer multiple co-benefits. A fourth, socio-behavioural aspects, can shift energy demand and emerge as the result of implementing the strategies. Urban mitigation options covered in this section are organised around these three strategies and can facilitate deep decarbonisation through systemic transformation (see Section 8.6 and Figure 8.21 for prioritising mitigation options based on urban form and urban growth typologies)."
wg3_ch08_8.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Urban areas are systems where multiple mitigation options – especially when integrated – have cascading effects across transport, energy, buildings, land use, and behaviour. These cascading effects take place both within and across urban systems (Figure 8.15). Mitigation actions also occur at multiple urban scales, from households and blocks to districts and city regions, and can be implemented as standalone sectoral strategies, such as increasing energy efficiency for appliances, and also as system-wide actions. In reducing emissions locally, urban areas can help lower emissions outside of their administrative boundaries through their use of materials and resources, and by increasing the efficiency of infrastructure and energy use beyond what is possible with individual sectoral strategies. Urban mitigation policies that implement multiple integrated interventions will provide more emissions savings than the sum of individual interventions (Sethi et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Integrated action also has a key role in providing benefits for human well-being. Urban mitigation options and strategies that are effective, efficient, and fair can also support broader sustainability goals (Güneralp et al. 2017; Kona et al. 2018; Pasimeni et al. 2019). Due to the complex and intensive interactions in urban systems and the interlinked nature of the SDGs, cities can be important intervention points to harness synergies and co-benefits for achieving emissions reductions along with other SDGs (Nilsson et al. 2016; Corbett and Mellouli 2017) (Section 8.2 and Figure 8.4)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Carbon lock-in occurs as the result of interactions between different geographic and administrative scales (institutional lock-in) and across sectors (infrastructural and technological lock-in), which create the conditions for behavioural lock-in covering both individual and social structural behaviours (Seto et al. 2016) (see Glossary for a broader definition of ‘lock-in’). The way that urban areas are designed, laid out, and built (i.e., urban form) affects and is affected by the interactions across the different forms of carbon lock-in (Figures 8.15 and 8.16). Cities are especially prone to carbon lock-in because of the multiple interactions of technological, institutional, and behavioural systems, which create inertia and path dependency that are difficult to break. For example, the lock-in of gasoline cars is reinforced by highway and energy infrastructures that are further locked-in by social and cultural preferences for individual mobility options. The dominance of cars and their supporting infrastructures in auto-centric urban forms is further reinforced by zoning and urban development patterns, such as dispersed and low-density housing distantly located from jobs, that create obstacles to creating alternative mobility options (Seto et al. 2016; Linton et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Urban infrastructures and the built environment are long-lived assets, embodying triple carbon lock-ins in terms of their construction, operations, and demolition (Creutzig et al. 2016b; Seto et al. 2016; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). There is much focus in the climate change literature on the operational lifetimes of the energy sector, especially power plants and the electricity grid, which are between 30 and 60 years (Rode et al. 2017). Yet, in reality, the lifespans of urban infrastructures, especially the basic layout of roadways, are often much longer (Reyna and Chester 2015). A number of detailed case studies on the evolution of urban road networks for cities around the world reveal that the current layout of streets grew out of street networks that were established hundreds of years ago (Strano et al. 2012; Masucci et al. 2013; Mohajeri and Gudmundsson 2014). Furthermore, there is evidence that urban street layout, population growth, urban development, and automobile ownership co-evolve (Li et al. 2019a)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"For cities to break out of mutually reinforcing carbon lock-in, it will require systematic transformation and systems-based planning that integrates mitigation strategies across sectors and geopolitical scales. Urban energy demand patterns are locked-in whenever incremental urban design and planning decisions, coupled with investments in long-lasting infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, take place (Seto et al. 2016). The fundamental building blocks of cities are based on the layout of the street network, the size of city blocks, and the density of street intersections. If not significantly altered, these three factors will continue to shape and lock-in energy demand for decades after their initial construction, influencing the mitigation potential of urban areas (Section 8.4.2 and Figure 8.22)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Avoiding carbon lock-in inherently involves decisions that extend beyond the administrative boundaries of cities. This includes pricing of low-emissions technology or materials, such as electric battery or hydrogen vehicles and buses, although cities can support their development and deployment (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16 on Transition Dynamics). In contrast, urban governments in most parts of the world do have powers to set building codes that regulate materials and construction standards for buildings, including heating and cooling technologies, and major appliances. Other examples include zoning that determines the location of buildings, land uses, standards for densities, and the inclusion of energy planning in their building standards and public works, including streets, parks, and open spaces (Blanco et al. 2011; Raven et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.2_p1,Urban Form ,"Urban form is the resultant pattern and spatial layout of land use, transportation networks, and urban design elements, including the physical urban extent, configuration of streets and building orientation, and the spatial figuration within and throughout cities and towns (Lynch 1981; Handy 1996). Infrastructure describes the physical structures, social and ecological systems, and corresponding institutional arrangements that provide services and enable urban activity (Dawson et al. 2018; Chester 2019) and comprises services and built-up structures that support urban functioning, including transportation infrastructure, water and wastewater systems, solid waste systems, telecommunications, and power generation and distribution (Seto et al. 2014)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 concluded that infrastructure and four dimensions of urban form are especially important for driving urban energy use: density, land-use mix, connectivity, and accessibility.

Urban areas with these features tend to have smaller dwelling units, smaller parcel sizes, walking opportunities, high density of intersections, and are highly accessible to shopping. For brevity, we will refer to these characteristics collectively as ‘compact and walkable urban form’ (Figure 8.16). Compact and walkable urban form has many co-benefits, including mental and physical health, lower resource demand, and saving land for AFOLU. In contrast, dispersed and auto-centric urban form is correlated with higher GHG emissions, and characterised by separated land uses, low population and job densities, large block size, and low intersection density."

There are important cascading effects not only for transport but also other key sectors and consumption patterns, such as in buildings, households, and energy. However, these benefits can be attained only when the existing spatial structure of an urban area does not limit locational and mobility options, thereby avoiding carbon lock-in through the interaction of infrastructure and the resulting socio-behavioural aspects."

The effect of urban form and built environment strategies on VMT per capita varies by a number of factors (Ewing and Cervero 2010; Stevens 2017; Blanco and Wikstrom 2018). Density and destination accessibility have the highest elasticities, followed by design (Stevens 2017). Population-weighted densities for 121 metropolitan areas have further found that the concentration of population and jobs along mass transit corridors decreases VMT/VKT significantly when compared to more dispersed metropolitan areas.

Urban compactness tends to reduce emissions per capita in the transport sector, especially for commuting (Matsuhashi and Ariga 2016; Lee and Lim 2018; Lee and Lee 2020). The relative accessibility of neighbourhoods to the rest of the region, in addition to the density of individual neighbourhoods, is important (Ewing et al. 2018). Creating higher residential and employment densities, developing smaller block sizes, and increasing housing opportunities in an employment area can significantly reduce household car ownership and car driving, and increase the share of transit, walk, and bicycle commuting (Ding et al. 2018). In addition to population density, land-use mix, rail transit accessibility, and street design reduce emissions from transport (Dou et al. 2016; Cao and Yang 2017; Choi 2018). The impact of population density and urban compactness on emissions per capita in the household or energy sector is also associated with socioeconomic characteristics or lifestyle preferences (Baiocchi et al. 2015; Miao 2017).

These interactions include support for demand-side flexibility, spatial planning using geographic information systems, and access to renewable and urban waste heat sources (Möller et al. 2018; REN21 2020; Sorknæs et al. 2020; Dorotić et al. 2019) (see Table 8.SM.2 for other references)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.3_p1,Electrification and Decarbonisation of the Urban Energy System ,"Pursuing the electrification of mobility, heating, and cooling systems, while decarbonising electricity and energy carriers, and switching to net-zero materials and supply chains, represent important strategies for urban mitigation. Electrification of energy end uses in cities and efficient energy demand for heating, transport, and cooking through multiple options and urban infrastructure, has an estimated mitigation potential of at least 6.9 GtCO2-eq by 2030 and 15.3 GtCO2-eq by 2050 (Coalition for Urban Transitions 2019). Energy efficiency measures in urban areas can be enabled by urban form, building codes, retrofitting and renovation, modal shifts, and other options. Decarbonising electricity supply raises the mitigation potential of efficient buildings and transport in urban areas to about 75% of the total estimate (Coalition for Urban Transitions 2019). In addition, relatively higher-density urban areas enable more cost-effective infrastructure investments, including electric public transport and large-scale heat pumps in districts that support electrification. Urban policymakers can play a key role in supporting carbon-neutral energy systems by acting as target setters and planners, demand aggregators, regulators, operators, conveners, and facilitators for coordinated planning and implementation across sectors, urban form, and demand (IEA 2021a; IRENA 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.3.1_p1,Smart grids in the urban system ,"Urban energy infrastructures often operate as part of larger energy systems that can be electrified, decarbonised, and become enablers of urban system flexibility through demand-side options. With multiple end-use sectors (e.g., transport, buildings) and their interactions with land use drawing on the same urban energy system(s), increasing electrification is essential for rapid decarbonisation, renewable energy penetration, and demand flexibility (Kammen and Sunter 2016) (see IMPs in Sections 3.2.5 and 8.3.4). The mitigation potential of electrification is ultimately dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity grid (Kennedy 2015; Hofmann et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2018; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) and starts providing lifecycle emission savings for carbon intensities below a threshold of 600 tCO2-eq GWh –1 (Kennedy et al. 2019). Integrated systems of roof-top photovoltaics (PVs) and all-electric vehicles (EVs) alone could supply affordable carbon-free electricity to cities and reduce CO2 emissions by 54–95% (Brenna et al. 2014; Kobashi et al. 2021). Furthermore, electrification and decarbonisation of the urban energy system holds widespread importance for climate change mitigation across different urban growth typologies and urban form (Section 8.6 and Figure 8.21) and leads to a multitude of public health co-benefits (see Section 8.2)."

Urban areas that connect efficient building clusters with the operation of smart thermal grids in district heating and cooling networks with large-scale heat pumps can support higher penetrations of variable renewable energy in smart energy systems (Lund et al. 2014, 2017).

As cities expand in size and density, there is an increase in the production of mineral-based structural materials and enclosure systems that are conventionally associated with mid- and high-rise urban construction morphologies, including concrete, steel, aluminium, and glass.

Among the category of primary structural materials, it is estimated that final energy demand for steel production can be reduced by nearly 30% compared to 2010 levels, with 12% efficiency improvement for cement (Lechtenböhmer et al. 2016). Even when industries are decarbonised, residual CO2 emissions will remain from associated chemical reactions that take place in calcination and use of coke from coking coal to reduce iron oxide (Davis et al. 2018). Additionally, carbon sequestration by cement occurs over the course of the building lifecycle in quantities that would offset only a fraction of their production stage carbon spike (Xi et al. 2016; Davis et al. 2018). Moreover, there are collateral effects on the carbon cycle related to modern construction and associated resource extraction. The production of cement, asphalt, and glass requires large amounts of sand extracted from beaches, rivers, and seafloors, disturbing aquatic ecosystems and reducing their capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. The mining of ore can lead to extensive local deforestation and soil degradation (Sonter et al. 2017).

Methods of mass-timber production that include finger-jointing, longitudinal and transverse lamination with both liquid adhesive and mechanical fasteners, have allowed for the reformulation of large structural timbers. The parallel-to-grain strength of mass (engineered) timber is similar to that of reinforced concrete (Ramage et al. 2017). As much as half the weight of a given volume of wood is carbon, sequestered during forest growth as a by-product of photosynthesis (Martin et al. 2018). Mass timber is inflammable, but in large sections forms a self-protective charring layer when exposed to fire that will protect the remaining ‘cold wood’ core. This property, formed as massive structural sections, is recognised in the fire safety regulations of building codes in several countries, which allow mid- and high-rise buildings in timber.

Other co-benefits include reducing urban runoff by about 17.5% and reducing summer temperatures by 2.5°C–6°C (Quaranta et al. 2021)."

For example, carbon sequestered by vegetation in Amazonian forests is two to five times higher compared to boreal and temperate forests (Blais et al. 2005). At the regional level, the estimated carbon storage density rates of tree cover include a range of 3.14–14.1 kgC m –2 in the United States, 3.85–5.58 kgC m –2 in South Korea, 1.53–9.67 kgC m –2 in Barcelona, Spain, 28.1–28.9 kgC m –2 in Leicester, England, and an estimated 6.82 kgC m –2 in Leipzig, Germany and 4.28 kgC m –2 in Hangzhou, China (Nowak et al. 2013). At the local scale, above- and below-ground tree carbon densities can vary substantially, as with carbon in soils and dead woody materials. The conservation of natural mangroves has been shown to provide urban mitigation benefits through carbon sequestration, as demonstrated in the Philippines (Abino et al. 2014). Research on urban carbon densities from the Southern Hemisphere will contribute to better estimates."

Forests can have a greater cooling effect on cities than designed greenspaces, and the bigger the forest the greater the effect (Jaganmohan et al. 2016). In New York City, urban forested natural areas have been found to account for the majority of trees estimated in the city (69%), but are a minority of the total tree canopy (25%, or 5.5% of the total city land area) (Pregitzer et al. 2019a). In New York City, natural areas are estimated to store a mean of 263.5 MgC ha –1 (megagram carbon per hectare), adding up to 1.86 TgC (teragram carbon) across the city, with the majority of carbon (86%) being stored in the trees and soils (Pregitzer et al. 2021). These estimates are similar to per-hectare estimates of carbon storage across different pools in non-urban forest types (Table 1), and 1.5 times greater than estimates for carbon stored in just trees across the entire city (Pregitzer et al. 2021)."

The oak-hardwood forest type is one of the most abundant in New York City’s natural areas and is characterised by large and long-lived native hardwood tree species, with relatively dense wood. These forests store an estimated 311.5 MgC ha –1. However, non-native exotic invasive species can be prevalent in the understory vegetation layer (<1m height), and account for about 50% of cover in New York City (Pregitzer et al. 2019b)."

This might suggest that in other geographies, similar adjacent non-urban forest types may store similar carbon stocks per unit area (medium confidence). However, despite similarities to non-urban forests, the urban context can lead to altered forest function and carbon cycling that should be considered. For example, trees growing in urban areas have been observed to grow at much higher rates due to higher access to light, nutrients, and increased temperatures (Gregg et al. 2003; Reinmann et al. 2020)."

More research is needed to map urban natural areas, assess vegetation, and differentiate tree canopy types (natural versus non-natural) at fine scales within many cities and geographies. Accurate maps, as well as greater understanding of definitions of urban canopies and vegetation, could lead to better accounts for carbon stocks and the many other unique benefits they provide (Raciti et al. 2012; Pregitzer et al. 2019a)."

The relative availability of options across these sectors has implications on urban emissions through individual behaviour. In turn, urban GHG emissions, as well as emissions from the supply chains of cities, are driven by the behaviour and consumption patterns of residents, with households accounting for over 60% of carbon emissions globally (Ivanova et al. 2016). The exclusion of consumption-based emissions and emissions that occur outside of city boundaries as a result of urban activities, however, will lead to significant undercounting. For example, a study of 79 major cities found that about 41% of consumption-based carbon footprints (1.8 GtCO2-eq of 4.4 GtCO2-eq) occurred outside of city boundaries."
wg3_ch08_8.4.5_p2,Increasing Locational and Mobility Options ,"Changes in behaviour across all areas (e.g., transport, buildings, food) could reduce an individual’s emissions by 5.6–16.2% relative to the accumulated GHG emissions from 2011 to 2050 in a baseline scenario modelled with the Global Change Assessment Model (van de Ven et al. 2018). In other models, behaviour change in transport and residential energy use could reduce emissions by 2 GtCO2-eq in 2030 compared to 2019 (IEA 2020b) (Chapter 5). Voluntary behaviour change can support emissions reduction, but behaviours that are not convenient to change are unlikely to shift without changes to policy (Sköld et al. 2018). Cities can increase the capability of citizens to make sustainable choices by making these choices less onerous, through avenues such as changing urban form to increase locational and mobility options and providing feedback mechanisms to support socio-behavioural change."

Cities can support voluntary shift to walking, cycling, and transit instead of car use through changes to urban form, such as TOD (Kamruzzaman et al. 2015), increased density of form with co-location of activities (Ma et al. 2015; Ding et al. 2017; Duranton and Turner 2018; Masoumi 2019), and greater intersection density and street integration (Koohsari et al. 2016).

Reductions in home energy use can be achieved by reducing floor area (0.5–3.0%), utilising more efficient appliances and lighting (2.7–5.0%), optimising thermostat settings (8.3–11%), using efficient heating and cooling technologies (6.7–10%), improving building insulation (2.9–4.0%), optimising clothes washing (5.0–5.7%), and optimising dishwashing (1–1.1%) (Levesque et al. 2019). Building standards and mandates could work towards making these options required or more readily available and accessible. Residential appliance use, water heating, and thermostat settings can be influenced by feedback on energy use, particularly when paired with real-time feedback and/or instructions on how to reduce energy use (Kastner and Stern 2015; Stern et al. 2016; Wynes et al. 2018; Tiefenbeck et al. 2019). The energy-saving potentials of changing occupant behaviour can range between 10% and 25% for residential buildings, and between 5% and 30% for commercial buildings (Zhang et al. 2018). Households are more likely to invest in energy-related home technologies if they believe it financially benefits (rather than disadvantages) them, increases comfort, or will benefit the natural environment (Kastner and Stern 2015). Social influences and availability of funding for household energy measures also support behaviour change (Kastner and Stern 2015)."

Accessibility as a criterion for urban form has been embedded in neighbourhood form models since at least the last century and in more recent decades in the ‘urban village’ concept of the New Urbanism (Duany and Plater-Zyberck 1991) and TODs (Calthorpe 1993). However, accessibility did not gain much traction in urban planning and transportation until the last decade. The experience of cities and metropolitan areas with the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a further resurgence in interest and importance (Handy 2020; Hu et al. 2020), and it is becoming a criterion at the core of the concept of the 15/20-minute city (Moreno et al. 2021; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021). Initially, neighbourhoods have been designed to provide quality, reliable services within 15 or 20 minutes of active transport (i.e., walking or cycling), as well as a variety of housing options and open space (Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability 2012; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021; State Government of Victoria 2021). Community life circles strategy for urban areas has also emphasised walking access and health (Weng et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2021).

Home composting and compact urban form can also reduce waste transport emissions (Oliveira et al. 2017). Decentralised waste management can reinforce source-separation behaviour since the resulting benefits can be more visible (Eisted et al. 2009; Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012; Linzner and Lange 2013). Public acceptance for waste management is greatest when system costs for citizens are reduced, there is greater awareness of primary waste separation at source, and there are positive behavioural spill-overs across environmental policies (Milutinović et al. 2016; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; Díaz-Villavicencio et al. 2017; Slorach et al. 2020). In addition to the choice of technology, the costs of waste management options depend on the awareness of system users that can represent time-dependent costs (Khan et al. 2016; Chifari et al. 2017; Ranieri et al. 2018; Tomić and Schneider 2020). Waste management systems and the inclusion of materials from multiple urban sectors for alternative by-products can increase scalability (Eriksson et al. 2015; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; D’Adamo et al. 2021).

The mitigation impacts of active travel can include a reduction of mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions by about 0.5 tonnes over a year when an average person cycles one trip per day more, and drives one trip per day less, for 200 days a year (Brand et al. 2021). Urban areas that develop and implement effective 15/20-minute city programmes are very likely to reduce urban energy use and multiply emission reductions, representing an important cascading effect."
wg3_ch08_8.4.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Accessibility as a criterion widens the focus beyond work trips and VKT/VMT, paying attention to a broader set of destinations beyond workplaces, as well as walking and biking trips or active travel. It holds promise for targeting and obtaining greater reductions in GHG emissions in household travel by providing access through walking, biking, and public transit. Accessibility as a criterion for urban form has been embedded in neighbourhood form models since at least the last century and in more recent decades in the ‘urban village’ concept of the New Urbanism (Duany and Plater-Zyberck 1991) and TODs (Calthorpe 1993). However, accessibility did not gain much traction in urban planning and transportation until the last decade. The experience of cities and metropolitan areas with the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a further resurgence in interest and importance (Handy 2020; Hu et al. 2020), and it is becoming a criterion at the core of the concept of the 15/20-minute city (Moreno et al. 2021; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021). Initially, neighbourhoods have been designed to provide quality, reliable services within 15 or 20 minutes of active transport (i.e., walking or cycling), as well as a variety of housing options and open space (Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability 2012; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021; State Government of Victoria 2021). Community life circles strategy for urban areas has also emphasised walking access and health (Weng et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2021). The growing popularity of the 15/20-minute city movement has significant potential for reducing VMT/VKT and associated GHG emissions."
wg3_ch08_8.4.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The waste sector is a significant source of GHG emissions, particularly CH4 (Gonzalez-Valencia et al. 2016; Nisbet et al. 2019). Currently, the sector remains the largest contributor to urban emissions after the energy sector, even in low-carbon cities (Lu and Li 2019). Since waste management systems are usually under the control of municipal authorities, they are a prime target for city-level mitigation efforts with co-benefits (EC 2015, 2020; Gharfalkar et al. 2015; Herrero and Vilella 2018; Zaman and Ahsan 2019). Despite general agreement on mitigation impacts, quantification remains challenging due to differing assumptions for system boundaries and challenges related to measuring avoided waste (Zaman and Lehmann 2013; Bernstad Saraiva Schott and Cánovas 2015; Matsuda et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The implementation of the waste hierarchy from waste prevention onward, as well as the effectiveness of waste separation at source, involves socio-behavioural options in the context of urban infrastructure (Sun et al. 2018a; Hunter et al. 2019). Managing and treating waste as close to the point of generation as possible, including distributed waste treatment facilities, can minimise transport-related emissions, congestion, and air pollution. Home composting and compact urban form can also reduce waste transport emissions (Oliveira et al. 2017). Decentralised waste management can reinforce source-separation behaviour since the resulting benefits can be more visible (Eisted et al. 2009; Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012; Linzner and Lange 2013). Public acceptance for waste management is greatest when system costs for citizens are reduced, there is greater awareness of primary waste separation at source, and there are positive behavioural spill-overs across environmental policies (Milutinović et al. 2016; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; Díaz-Villavicencio et al. 2017; Slorach et al. 2020). In addition to the choice of technology, the costs of waste management options depend on the awareness of system users that can represent time-dependent costs (Khan et al. 2016; Chifari et al. 2017; Ranieri et al. 2018; Tomić and Schneider 2020). Waste management systems and the inclusion of materials from multiple urban sectors for alternative by-products can increase scalability (Eriksson et al. 2015; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; D’Adamo et al. 2021). As a broader concept, circular economy approaches can contribute to managing waste (Box 12.8) with varying emissions impacts (Section 5.3.4)."
wg3_ch08_8.4.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The generation and composition of waste varies considerably from region to region and city to city. So do the levels of institutional management, infrastructure, and (informal) work in waste disposal activities. Depending on context, policy priorities are directed towards reducing waste generation and transforming waste to energy or other products in a circular economy (Diaz 2017; Ezeudu and Ezeudu 2019; Joshi et al. 2019; Calderón Márquez and Rutkowski 2020; Fatimah et al. 2020). Similarly, waste generation, waste collection coverage, recycling, and composting rates, as well as the means of waste disposal and treatment, differ widely, including the logistics of urban waste management systems. Multiple factors influence waste generation, and regions with similar urbanisation rates can generate different levels of waste per capita (Kaza et al. 2018)."

Organisational structure and programme administration poses demands for institutional capacity, governance, and cross-sectoral coordination for obtaining the maximum benefit (Hjalmarsson 2015; Kalmykova et al. 2016; Conke 2018; Marino et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018)."

As supply chains are becoming increasingly global in nature, so are the resource flows with the hinterlands of cities. In addition to measures within the jurisdictional boundaries of cities, cities can influence large upstream emissions through their supply chains, as well as through activities that rely on resources outside city limits. The dual strategy of implementing local actions and taking responsibility for the entire supply chains of imported and exported goods can reduce GHG emissions outside of a city’s administrative boundaries (Figure 8.15)."

Integrated waste management and zero-waste targets can allow urban areas to maximise the mitigation potential while reducing pressures on land use and the environment. This mitigation option reduces emissions due to (i) avoided emissions upstream in the supply chain of materials based on measures for recycling and the reuse of materials; (ii) avoided emissions due to land-use changes as well as emissions that are released into the atmosphere from waste disposal; and (ii) avoided primary energy (see Glossary) spending and emissions. Socio-behavioural change that reduces waste generation, combined with technology and infrastructure according to the waste hierarchy, can be especially effective. The mitigation potential of waste-to-energy depends on the technological choices that are undertaken (e.g., anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction), the emissions factor of the energy mix that it replaces, and its broader role within integrated municipal solid management practices (Eriksson et al. 2015; Potdar et al. 2016; Yu and Zhang 2016; Soares and Martins 2017; Alzate-Arias et al. 2018; Islam 2018).

Reducing food demand from urban hinterlands can have a positive impact on energy and water demand for food production (Eigenbrod and Gruda 2015) (see ‘food system’ in Glossary). Managing food waste in urban areas through recycling or reduction of food waste at source of consumption would require behavioural change (Gu et al. 2019). Urban governments could also support shifts towards more climate-friendly diets, including through procurement policies. These strategies have created economic opportunities or have enhanced food security while reducing the emissions that are associated with waste and the transportation of food. Strategies for managing food demand in urban areas would depend on the integration of food systems in urban planning."

The pathways include integrated crop-livestock systems, urban agroforestry systems, aquaculture-livestock-crop systems, and crop systems (Lwasa et al. 2015), while the mitigation potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture has medium agreement  and low evidence. Strategies for urban food production in cities have also relied on recycling nutrients from urban waste and utilisation of harvested rainwater or wastewater."

Reducing energy use for urban water systems involves reducing energy requirements for water supply, purification, distribution, and drainage (Ahmad et al. 2020). Various levels of rainwater harvesting in urban settings for supplying end-use water demands or supporting urban food production can reduce municipal water demands, including by up to 20% or more in Cape Town (Fisher-Jeffes et al. 2017)."

The other looks at the needs for emissions through a more systematic or fundamental understanding of urban design, urban form, and urban spatial planning (Wang et al. 2017; Privitera et al. 2018), and proposes synergistic scenarios for their integration for carbon neutrality (Ravetz et al. 2020)."

However, crucial knowledge gaps remain in this field. There is a shortage of consistent and comparable GHG emissions data at the city level and a lack of in-depth understanding of how urban renewal and design can contribute to carbon neutrality (Mi et al. 2019)."

In the urban context, this implies using less material by the design of physical infrastructure based on light-weighting and down-sizing, material substitution, prolonged use, as well as enhanced recycling, recovery, remanufacturing, and reuse of materials and related components. For example, light-weight design in residential buildings and passenger vehicles can enable about 20% reductions in lifecycle material-related GHG emissions (UNEP IRP 2020)."

In addition, combining resource efficiency measures with strategic densification can increase the GHG reduction potential and lower resource impacts. While resource efficiency measures are estimated to reduce GHG emissions, land use, water consumption, and metal use impacts from a lifecycle assessment perspective by 24–47% over a baseline, combining resource efficiency with strategic densification can increase this range to about 36–54% over the baseline for a sample of 84 urban settlements worldwide (Swilling et al. 2018)."

Similarly, system-wide interventions, such as sustainable urban form, are important for increasing the GHG abatement potential of interventions based on individual sectoral projects (Sethi et al. 2020). Overall, the pursuit of inter-linkages among urban interventions is important for accelerating GHG reductions in urban areas (Sethi et al. 2020); this is also important for reducing reliance on carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS) at the global scale (Figures 8.15 and 8.21)."

Cross-sectoral integration also involves mobilising urban actors to increase innovation in energy services and markets beyond individual energy efficiency actions (Hsu et al. 2020c). Indeed, single-sector versus cross-sector strategies for 637 cities from a developing country can enable an additional 15–36% contribution to the national climate mitigation reduction potential (Ramaswami et al. 2017a).

Like transnational climate networks, these platforms provide key opportunities to local governments to further their own mitigation goals, engage in knowledge transfer with other cities and regions, and shape policies at higher levels of authority (Cities for Climate 2015; Castán Broto 2017b)."

These impacts on energy and carbon intensities represent progress, while challenges remain.

wg3_ch08_8.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"A significant research question that has been paid more attention in both the scientific and policy communities is related to subnational actors’ role in and contribution to global climate mitigation. The 2018 UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) annual Emissions Gap report in 2018 included for the first time a special chapter on subnational and non-state (i.e., businesses and private) actors and assessed the landscape of studies aiming to quantify their contributions to global climate mitigation. Non-state action on net-zero GHG or CO2 emissions continues to be emphasised (UNEP 2021) (Box 8.4). There has been an increase in the number of studies aiming to quantify the overall aggregate mitigation impact of subnational climate action globally. Estimates for the significance of their impact vary widely, from up to 30 MtCO2-eq from 25 cities in the United States in 2030 (Roelfsema 2017), to a 2.3 GtCO2-eq reduction in 2030 compared to a current policy scenario from over 10,239 cities participating in GCoM (Hsu et al. 2018; GCoM 2019). For regional governments, the Under 2 Coalition, which includes 260 governments pledging goals to keep global temperature rise below 2°C, is estimated to reduce emissions by 4.2 GtCO2-eq in 2030, compared to a current policy scenario (Kuramochi et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Some studies suggest that subnational mitigation actions (Roelfsema 2017; Kuramochi et al. 2020) are in addition to national government mitigation efforts and can therefore reduce emissions even beyond current national policies, helping to ‘bridge the gap’ between emissions trajectories consistent with least-cost scenarios for limiting temperature rise below 1.5°C or 2°C (Blok et al. 2012). In some countries, such as the United States, where national climate policies have been curtailed, the potential for cities’ and regions’ emissions reduction pledges to make up the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement is assessed to be significant (Kuramochi et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch08_8.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"These estimates are also often contingent on assumptions that subnational actors fulfil their pledges and that these actions do not result in rollbacks in climate action (i.e., weakening of national climate legislation) from other actors or rebound in emissions growth elsewhere, but data tracking or quantifying the likelihood of their implementation remains rare (Chan et al. 2018; Hsu et al. 2019; Hale et al. 2020; Kuramochi et al. 2020). Reporting networks may attract high-performing cities, suggesting an artificially high level of cities interested in taking climate action or piloting solutions that may not be effective elsewhere (van der Heijden 2018). These studies could also present a conservative view of potential mitigation impact because they draw upon publicly reported mitigation actions and inventory data, excluding subnational actors that may be taking actions but not reporting them (Kuramochi et al. 2020). The nuances of likelihood, and the drivers and obstacles of climate action across different contexts is a key source of uncertainty around subnational actors’ mitigation impacts."

These organisations, often operating across and between national boundaries, entail some type of action on climate change. Among the most prominent climate networks are GCoM, ICLEI, and C40, all of which ask their members to adopt emission reduction commitments, develop climate action plans, and regularly report on emissions inventories."

Their impact comes through (i) providing resources for cities and regions to reduce their GHG emissions and improve environmental quality more generally, independent of national policy; (ii) encouraging knowledge transfer between member cities and regions; and (iii) acting as platforms of national and international policy influence (Castán Broto 2017b; Fuhr et al. 2018)."

In one of the largest studies of subnational climate mitigation action, more than 93% of just over 6000 quantifiable subnational climate commitments come from cities and regions based in the European Union (NewClimate Institute et al. 2019). Such gaps in geographic coverage have been attributed to factors such as the dominating role of Global North actors in the convening and diffusion of ‘best practices’ related to climate action (Bouteligier 2013), or the more limited autonomy or ability of subnational or non-state actors in Global South countries to define boundaries and interests separately from national governments, particularly those that exercise top-down decision-making or have vertically integrated governance structures (Bulkeley et al. 2012). Many of the participating subnational actors from under-represented regions are large megacities (of 10 million people or more) that will play a pivotal role in shaping emissions trajectories (Data Driven Yale et al. 2018; NewClimate Institute et al. 2019)."

In turn, the transformation of urban systems can significantly impact net-zero-emissions trajectories within mitigation pathways.

wg3_ch08_8.5.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement will require fundamental changes that will be most successful when cities work together with provincial and national leadership and legislation, third-sector leadership, transformative action, and supportive financing. Urban governments often obtain their powers from provincial, state and/or national governments, and are subjected to laws and regulations to regulate development and implement infrastructure. In addition, the sources of revenue are often set at these levels so that many urban governments rely on state/provincial and national government funds for improving infrastructure, especially transit infrastructure. The increasing financialisation of urban infrastructures is another factor that can make it more difficult for local governments to determine infrastructure choices (O’Brien et al. 2019). Urban transit system operations, in particular, are heavily subsidised in many countries, both locally and by higher levels of government. As a result of this interplay of policy and legal powers among various levels of government, the lock-in nature of urban infrastructures and built environments will require multi-level governance responses to ensure meeting decarbonisation targets. The reliance on state and national policy and/or funding can accelerate or impede the decarbonisation of urban environments (McCarney et al. 2011; McCarney 2019)."

However, today’s climate finance flows for cities or ‘urban climate finance’, estimated at USD384 billion annually on average in 2017/18, are insufficient to meet the USD4.5–5.4 trillion annual investment needs for urban mitigation actions across key sectors (CCFLA 2015; CPI and World Bank 2021; Negreiros et al. 2021). Low-carbon urban form (e.g., compact, high-density, and mixed-use characteristics) is likely to economise spending in infrastructure along with the application of new technologies and renewable energies that would be able to recover the increasing upfront cost of low-carbon infrastructure from more efficient operating and energy savings (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Global Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014; Foxon et al. 2015; Bhattacharya et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b)."

Nonetheless, the risk of high carbon lock-ins is likely to increase in rapidly growing cities if long-term urban mitigation strategies are not incorporated into short-term economic recovery actions (Granoff et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b; CPI and World Bank 2021; Negreiros et al. 2021). Indeed, large and complex infrastructure projects for urban mitigation are often beyond the capacity of both national government and local municipality budgets.

In particular, national governments are expected to set up enabling conditions for the mobilisation of urban climate finance resource by articulating various goals and strategies, improving pricing, regulation and standards, and developing investment vehicles and risk sharing instruments (Qureshi 2015; Bielenberg et al. 2016; Granoff et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Sudmant et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b; Zhan and de Jong 2018; Hadfield and Cook 2019; CPI and World Bank 2021; Negreiros et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.5.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Indeed, 75% of the global climate finance for both mitigation and adaptation in 2017 and 2018 took the form of commercial financing (e.g., balance sheets, commercial-rate loans, equity), while 25% came in the form of concessionary financing (e.g., grants, below-market-rate loans). However, cities in developing countries are facing difficulty making use of commercial financing and gaining access to international credit markets. Cities without international creditworthiness currently rely on local sources, including domestic commercial banks (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Global Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014; CCFLA 2015; Floater et al. 2017; Buchner et al. 2019)."

While green municipal bonds still account for a small share of the whole green bond market in 2020, scale is predicted to grow further in emerging markets over the coming years. Green municipal bonds have great potential for cities to expand and diversify their investor base. In addition, the process of issuing green municipal bonds is expected to promote cross-sector cooperation within a city by bringing together various agencies responsible for finance, climate change, infrastructure, planning and design, and operation. Indeed, the demand for green bonds presently outstrips supply as being constantly over-subscripted (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Global Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014; Saha and D’Almeida 2017; Amundi and IFC 2021)."

The lack of creditworthiness is one of the main problems preventing cities from issuing green municipal bonds in developing countries. As a prerequisite for the application of municipal debt-financing, it is an essential condition for cities to ensure sufficient own revenues from low-carbon urbanisation, or the default risk becomes too high for potential investors. Indeed, many cities in developed countries and emerging economies have already accumulated substantial amounts of debts through bond insurances, and ongoing debt payments prevent new investments in low-carbon infrastructure projects."

Another problem with green municipal bonds is the lack of aggregation mechanisms to support various small-scale projects in cities. Asset-backed securities are likely to reduce the default risk for investors through portfolio diversification and create robust pipelines for a bundle of small-scale projects (Granoff et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Saha and D’Almeida 2017).

Nevertheless, small cities in developing countries are likely to have a small revenue base, most of which is committed to recurring operating costs, associated with weak revenue collection and management systems. In recent years, there has been scope to apply not only user-based but also land-based funding instruments for the recovery of upfront capital costs (Braun and Hazelroth 2015; Kościelniak and Górka 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b; Zhan and de Jong 2018; Zhan et al. 2018a)."

Land value capture is expected not only for cities to generate additional revenue streams but also to prevent low-density urban expansion around city-fringe locations.

Particularly, the concept of a transparent, decentralised public ledger is adapted to facilitate value-added property transactions on a P2P basis without centralised intermediate parties and produce land-based funding opportunities for low-carbon infrastructure and real estate development district-wide and city-wide in unconventional ways (Veuger 2017; Nasarre-Aznar 2018)."

Large-scale system transformations are also deeply influenced by factors outside governance and institutions, such as private interests and power dynamics (Jaglin 2014; Tyfield 2014). In some cases, these private interests are tied up with international flows of capital. At the local level, a lack of empowerment, high upfront costs, inadequate and uncertain funding for mitigation, diverse and conflicting policy objectives, multiple agencies and actors with diverse interests, high levels of informality, and a siloed approach to climate action are constraining factors to mainstreaming climate action (Beermann et al. 2016; Gouldson et al. 2016; Pathak and Mahadevia 2018; Khosla and Bhardwaj 2019)."

The scope of this assessment enables an approach for considering multiple aspects that have an impact on feasibility as a tool for policy support (Singh et al. 2020). In Figure 8.19, the assessment framework that is based on geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural, and institutional dimensions is applied to identify the enablers and/or barriers in implementing mitigation options in urban systems. The feasibility of options may differ across context, time, and scale (Section 8.SM.2). The line of sight upon which the assessment is based includes urban case studies (Lamb et al. 2019) and assessments of land use and spatial planning in IPCC SR1.5 (IPCC 2018a)."

Improvements in air quality are possible when higher urban densities are combined with modes of active transport, electrified mobility as well as urban green and blue infrastructure (Sections 8.3.4, 8.4 and 8.6). The demands on geophysical resources, including materials for urban development, will depend on whether additional strategies are in place with largely negative impacts under conventional practices. The technological scalability of multiple urban mitigation options is favourable while varying according to the level of existing urban development and scale of implementation (Tables 8.SM.3 and 8.SM.4)."
wg3_ch08_8.5.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Similarly, multiple mitigation options have positive impacts on employment and economic growth, especially when urban densities enable productivity. Possible distributional effects, including availability of affordable accommodation and access to greenspace, are best addressed when urban policy packages combine more than one policy objective. Such an approach can provide greater support to urban mitigation efforts with progress towards shifting urban development to sustainability. The electrification of the urban energy system involves multiple enablers that support the feasibility of this mitigation option, including positive impacts on health and well-being. In addition, increases in urban densities can support the planning of district heating and cooling networks that can decarbonize the built environment at scale with technology readiness levels increasing for lower temperature supply options. Preventing, minimising, and managing waste as an urban mitigation option can be enabled when informality in the sector is transformed to secure employment effects and value-addition based on the more circular use of resources (Sections 8.4.3 and 8.4.5, and Tables 8.SM.3 and 8.SM.4 in Supplementary Material 8.2)."
wg3_ch08_8.5.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"As a combined evaluation, integrating multiple mitigation options in urban systems involves the greatest requirement for strengthening institutional capacity and governance through cross-sectoral coordination. Notably, integrated action requires significant effort to coordinate sectors and strategies across urban growth typologies (Sections 8.4 and 8.6, and Figure 8.21). Institutional capacity, if not strengthened to a suitable level to handle this process – especially to break out of carbon lock-in – can fall short of the efforts this entails. These conditions can pose barriers for realising cross-sectoral coordination while the formation of partnerships and stakeholder engagement take place as important enablers. Overcoming institutional challenges for cross-sectoral coordination can support realising synergies among the benefits that each mitigation option can offer within and across urban systems, including for the SDGs. These include those that can be involved in co-located and walkable urban form together with decarbonising and electrifying the urban energy system as well as urban green and blue infrastructure, providing the basis for more liveable, resource efficient and compact urban development with benefits for urban inhabitants (Section 8.2)."

This section brings together the urban mitigation options described in Section 8.4 and assesses the range of mitigation potentials for different types of cities. There is consensus in the literature that mitigation strategies are most effective when multiple interventions are coupled together. Urban-scale interventions that implement multiple strategies concurrently through policy packages are more effective and have greater emissions savings than when single interventions are implemented separately. This is because a city-wide strategy can have cascading effects across sectors, that have multiplicative effects on GHG emissions reduction within and outside a city’s administrative boundaries. Therefore, city-scale strategies can reduce more emissions than the net sum of individual interventions, particularly if multiple scales of governance are included (Sections 8.4 and 8.5). Furthermore, cities have the ability to implement policy packages across sectors using an urban systems approach, such as through planning, particularly those that affect key infrastructures (Figures 8.15, 8.17 and 8.22)."
wg3_ch08_8.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"The way that cities are laid out and built will shape the entry points for realising systemic transformation across urban form and infrastructure, energy systems, and supply chains. Section 8.3.1 discusses the ongoing trend of rapid urbanisation – and how it varies through different forms of urban development or ‘typologies’ (Figure 8.6). Below, Figure 8.20 distils the typologies of urban growth across three categories: emerging, rapidly growing, and established. Urban growth is relatively stabilised in established urban areas with mature urban form while newly taking shape in emerging urban areas. In contrast, rapidly growing urban areas experience pronounced changes in outward and/or upward growth. These typologies are not mutually exclusive, and can co-exist within an urban system; cities typically encompass a spectrum of development, with multiple types of urban form and various typologies (Mahtta et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch08_8.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"Taken together, urban form (Figure 8.16) and growth typology (Figure 8.20) can act as a roadmap for cities or sub-city communities looking to identify their urban context and, by extension, the mitigation opportunities with the greatest potential to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, this considers whether a city is established with existing and managed infrastructure; rapidly growing with new and actively developing infrastructure; or emerging with large amounts of infrastructure build-up. The long lifespan of urban infrastructure locks in behaviour and committed emissions. Therefore, the sequencing of mitigation strategies is important for determining emissions savings in the short and long term. Hence, different types of cities will have different mitigation pathways, depending upon a city’s urban form and state of that city’s urban development and infrastructure; the policy packages and implementation plan that provide the highest mitigation potential for rapidly growing cities with new infrastructures will differ from those for established cities with existing infrastructure."
wg3_ch08_8.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"Mitigation options that involve spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure – particularly co-located and mixed land use, as well as TOD – provide the greatest opportunities when urban areas are rapidly growing or emerging (Section 8.4.2). Established urban areas that are already compact and walkable have captured mitigation benefits from these illustrative strategies to various extents. Conversely, established urban areas that are dispersed and auto-centric have foregone these opportunities, with the exception of urban infill and densification that can be used to transform or continue to transform the existing urban form. Figure 8.21 underscores that urban mitigation options and illustrative strategies differ by urban growth typologies and urban form. Cities can identify their entry points for sequencing mitigation strategies."

According to the development level, for instance, urban form can remain mostly planned or unplanned, taking place spontaneously, with persistent urban infrastructure gaps remaining (Lwasa et al. 2018; Kareem et al. 2020). Measures for closing the urban infrastructure gap while addressing ‘leapfrogging’ opportunities (see Glossary) for mitigation and providing co-benefits represent possibilities for shifting development paths for sustainability (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4)."
wg3_ch08_8.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Shifting pathways to low-carbon development for established cities with existing infrastructures and locked-in behaviours and lifestyles is admittedly challenging. Urban infrastructures such as buildings, roads, and pipelines often have long lifetimes that lock-in emissions, as well as institutional and individual behaviour. Although the expected lifetime of buildings varies considerably by geography, design, and materials, typical lifespans are at minimum 30 years to more than 100 years."

Retrofitting buildings with state of the art deep-energy retrofit measures could reduce emissions of the existing stock by about 30–60% (Creutzig et al. 2016a) and in some cases up to 80% (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2020) (Section 8.4.3)."

Illustrative mitigation strategies with the highest mitigation potential are decarbonising electricity and energy carriers while electrifying mobility, heating, and cooling (Table 8.3 and Figure 8.19). Within integrated strategies, the importance of urban forests, street trees, and green space as well as green roofs, walls, and retrofits, also have high mitigation potential (Section 8.4.4 and Figure 8.18)."

Only then can the urban form constraints on locational and mobility options be effective at reducing transport-based emissions. Among mitigation options based on spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure, urban infill and densification has priority. For these cities, the use of urban green and blue infrastructure will be essential to offset residual emissions that cannot be reduced because their urban form is already established and difficult to change."
wg3_ch08_8.6.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"System-wide energy savings and emissions reductions for low-carbon urban development are widely recognised to require both behavioural and structural changes (Zhang and Li 2017). Synergies between social and ecological innovation can reinforce the sustainability of urban systems while decoupling energy usage and economic growth (Hu et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2018). In addition, an integrated sustainable development approach that enables cross-sector energy efficiency, sustainable transport, renewable energy, and local development in urban neighbourhoods can address issues of energy poverty (Pukšec et al. 2018). In this context, cross-sectoral, multi-scale, and public-private collaborative action is crucial to steer societies and cities closer to low-carbon futures (Hölscher et al. 2019). Such actions include guiding residential living area per capita, limiting private vehicle growth, expanding public transport, improving the efficiency of urban infrastructure, enhancing urban carbon pools, and minimising waste through sustainable, ideally circular, waste management (Lin et al. 2018). Through a coordinated approach, urban areas can be transformed into hubs for renewable and distributed energy, sustainable mobility, as well as inclusivity and health (Newman et al. 2017; Newman 2020 )."

Integrated modelling approaches for urban energy system planning, including land use and transport and flexible demand-side options, is increased when municipal actors are also recognised as energy planners (Yazdanie and Orehounig 2021) (Section 8.4.3). Enablers for action can include the co-design of infill residential development through an inclusive and participatory process with citizen utilities and disruptive innovation that can support net-zero-carbon power while contributing to 1.5°C pathways, the SDGs, and affordable housing simultaneously (Wiktorowicz et al. 2018). Cross-sectoral strategies for established cities, including those taking place among 120 urban areas, also involve opportunities for sustainable development (Kılkış 2019, 2021b)."

Transformative urban futures that are radically different from the existing trajectories of urbanisation, including in developing countries, can remain within planetary boundaries while being inclusive of the urban poor (Friend et al. 2016). At the urban policy level, an analysis of 12,000 measures in urban-level monitoring emissions inventories based on the mode of governance further suggests that local authorities with lower population have primarily relied on municipal self-governing while local authorities with higher population more frequently adopted regulatory measures as well as financing and provision (Palermo et al. 2020b). Policies that relate to education and enabling were uniformly adopted regardless of population size (Palermo et al. 2020b). Multi-disciplinary teams, including urban planners, engineers, architects, and environmental institutions, can support local decision-making capacities, including for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy considering building intensity and energy use (Mrówczyńska et al. 2021) (Section 8.5)."

In growing cities that are expected to experience large increases in population, a significant share of urban development remains to be planned and built. The ability to shift these investments towards low-carbon development earlier in the process represents an important opportunity for contributing to net-zero GHG emissions at the global scale. In particular, evidence suggests that investment in low-carbon development measures and reinvestment based on the returns of the measures, even without considering substantial co-benefits, can provide tipping points for climate mitigation action and reaching peak emissions at lower levels while decoupling emissions from economic growth, even in fast-growing megacity contexts with well-established infrastructure (Colenbrander et al. 2017)."

In addition, community-based distributed renewable electricity can be applicable for the regeneration of informal settlements rather than more expensive informal settlement clearance (Teferi and Newman 2018). Scalable options for decentralised energy, water, and wastewater systems, as well as spatial planning and urban agriculture and forestry, are applicable to urban settlements across multiple regions simultaneously (Lwasa 2017)."

This challenge can be addressed with coordinated urban planning and support from enabling conditions for pursuing effective climate mitigation (Section 8.5 and Box 8.3). The ability to mobilise low-carbon development will also increase opportunities for capturing co-benefits for urban inhabitants while reducing embodied and operational emissions. Transforming urban growth, including its impacts on energy and materials, can be carefully addressed with the integration of cross-sectoral strategies and policies."

For rapidly growing cities that may be co-located and walkable at present, remaining compact is better ensured when co-location and mixed land use, as well as TOD, continues to be prioritised (Section 8.4.2). Concurrently, ensuring that electricity and energy carriers are decarbonised while electrifying mobility, heating and cooling will support the mitigation potential of these cities. Along with an integrated approach across other illustrative strategies, switching to net-zero materials and supply chains holds importance (Section 8.4.3). Cities that remain compact and walkable can provide a greater array of locational and mobility options to the inhabitants that can be adopted for mitigation benefits. Rapidly growing cities that may currently be dispersed and auto-centric can capture high mitigation potential through urban infill and densification. Conserving existing green and blue assets, thereby protecting sources of carbon storage and sequestration, as well as biodiversity, have high potential for both kinds of existing urban form, especially when the rapid growth can be controlled."

A large share of urban infrastructures that will be in place by 2050 has yet to be constructed and their design and implementation will determine both future GHG emissions as well as the ability to meet mitigation goals (Creutzig et al. 2016a) (Figure 8.10 and Table 8.1).

Thus, the demand that new and emerging cities will place on natural resource use, materials, and emissions can be minimised and avoided only if urban settlements are planned and built much differently than today, including minimised impacts on land use based on compact urban form, lowered use of materials, and related cross-sector integration, including energy-driven urban design for sustainable urbanisation."
wg3_ch08_8.6.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Minimising and avoiding raw material demands depends on alternative options while accommodating the urban population. In addition, operational emissions that can be committed by new urban infrastructure can range between 8.5 GtCO2 and 14 GtCO2 annually up to 2030 (Erickson and Tempest 2015). Buildings and road networks are strongly influenced by urban layouts, densities, and specific uses. Cities that are planned and built much differently than today through light-weighting, material substitution, resource efficiency, renewable energy, and compact urban form, have the potential to support more sustainable urbanisation and provide co-benefits for inhabitants (Figures 8.17 and 8.22)."

Priorities for decarbonising electricity and energy carriers while electrifying mobility, heating, and cooling take place within the integrated approach (Section 8.4.3). Increasing greenways and permeable surfaces, especially from the design of emerging urban areas onward, can be pursued, also for adaptation co-benefits and linkages with the SDGs (Section 8.4.4 and Figure 8.18)."

Energy-driven urban design generates and optimises urban form according to the energy performance outcome (Shi et al. 2017b). Beyond the impact of urban form on building energy performance, the approach focuses on the interdependencies between urban form and energy infrastructure in urban energy systems. The process can provide opportunities for both passive options for energy-driven urban design, such as the use of solar gain for space heating, or of thermal mass to moderate indoor temperatures, as well as active options that involve the use of energy infrastructure and technologies while recognising interrelations of the system. Future urban settlements can also be planned and built with net-zero CO2 or net-zero GHG emissions, as well as renewable energy targets, in mind. Energy master planning of urban areas that initially target net-zero operational GHG emissions can be supported with energy master planning from conceptual design to operation, including district-scale energy strategies (Charani Shandiz et al. 2021)."

Relative decoupling is obtained (Kalmykova et al. 2015) with increasing evidence for turning points in per capita emissions, total emissions, or urban metabolism (Chen et al. 2018b; Shen et al. 2018). The importance of integrating energy and resource efficiency in sustainable and low-carbon city planning (Dienst et al. 2015), structural changes, as well as forms of disruptive social innovation, such as the ‘sharing economy’ (see Glossary), is also evident based on analyses for multiple cities, including those that can be used to lower the carbon footprints of urban areas relative to sub-urban areas (Chen et al. 2018a)."

The evidence for the connection between household crowding and the risk of contagion from infectious diseases is also strong.

Additionally, there is no standardisation of emissions data and limited independent validation procedures (Gurney and Shepson 2021). This is partly driven by the recognition that urban emissions can be conceptualised using different frameworks, each of which has a different meaning for different urban communities (Section 8.1.6.2). Equally important is the recognition that acquisition and analysis of complex data used to populate urban GHG inventory protocols remains a barrier for local practitioners (Creutzig et al. 2019). The limited standardisation has also led to incomparability of the many individual or city cluster analyses that have been accomplished since AR5. Finally, comprehensive, global quantification of urban emissions remains incomplete in spite of recent efforts (Moran et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2018; Harris et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2021; Wiedmann et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.7.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Similarly, independent verification or evaluation of urban GHG emissions has seen a large number of research studies (e.g., Wu et al. 2016; Sargent et al. 2018; Whetstone 2018; Lauvaux et al. 2020). This has been driven by the recognition that self-reported approaches may not provide adequate accuracy to track emissions changes and provide confidence for mitigation investment (Gurney and Shepson 2021)."
wg3_ch08_8.7.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The most promising approach to independent verification of urban emissions has been the use of urban atmospheric monitoring (direct flux and/or concentration) as a means to assess and track urban GHG emissions (Davis et al. 2017). However, like the basic accounting approach itself, standardisation and practical deployment and scaling is an essential near-term need."
wg3_ch08_FAQ 8.1 | 	Why are urban areas important to global climate change mitigation?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Over half of the world’s population currently resides in urban areas – a number forecasted to increase to nearly 70% by 2050. Urban areas also account for a growing proportion of national and global emissions, depending on emissions scope and geographic boundary. These trends are projected to grow in the coming decades; in 2100, some scenarios show the urban share of global emissions above 80%, with 63% being the minimum for any scenario (with the shares being in different contexts of emissions reduction or increase) (Sections 8.3.3 and 8.3.4). As such, urban climate change mitigation considers the majority of the world’s population, as well as some of the key drivers of global emissions. In general, emissions scenarios with limited outward urban land expansion are also associated with a smaller rise in global temperature (Section 8.3.4)."
wg3_ch08_FAQ 8.1 | 	Why are urban areas important to global climate change mitigation?_p2,NO_TITLE,"The urban share of global emissions and its projected growth stem in part from urban carbon lock-in – that is, the path dependency and inertia of committed emissions through the long lifespan of urban layout, infrastructures, and behaviour. As such, urban mitigation efforts that address lock-in can significantly reduce emissions (Section 8.4.1). Electrification of urban energy systems, in tandem with implementing multiple urban-scale mitigation strategies, could reduce urban emissions by 90% by 2050 – thereby significantly reducing global emissions (Section 8.3.4). Urban areas can also act as points of intervention to amplify synergies and co-benefits for accomplishing the Sustainable Development Goals (Section 8.2)."
"wg3_ch08_FAQ 8.2 |	What are the most impactful options cities can take to mitigate urban emissions, and how can these be best implemented?_p1",NO_TITLE,"The most impactful urban mitigation plans reduce urban GHG emissions by considering the long lifespan of urban layout and urban infrastructures (Sections 8.4.1 and 8.6). Chapter 8 identifies three overarching mitigation strategies with the largest potential to decrease current, and avoid future, urban emissions: (i) reducing or changing urban energy and material use towards more sustainable production and consumption across all sectors including through spatial planning and infrastructure that supports compact, walkable urban form (Section 8.4.2); (ii) decarbonise through electrification of the urban energy system, and switch to net-zero-emissions resources (i.e., low-carbon infrastructure) (Section 8.4.3); and (iii) enhance carbon sequestration through urban green and blue infrastructure (e.g., green roofs, urban forests and street trees), which can also offer multiple co-benefits like reducing ground temperatures and supporting public health and well-being (Section 8.4.4). Integrating these mitigation strategies across sectors, geographic scales, and levels of governance will yield the greatest emissions savings (Sections 8.4 and 8.5)."
"wg3_ch08_FAQ 8.2 |	What are the most impactful options cities can take to mitigate urban emissions, and how can these be best implemented?_p2",NO_TITLE,"A city’s layout, patterns, and spatial arrangements of land use, transportation systems, and built environment (urban form), as well as its state and form(s) of development (urban growth typology), can inform the most impactful emissions savings ‘entry points’ and priorities for urban mitigation strategies (Sections 8.4.2 and 8.6). For rapidly growing and emerging urban areas, there is the opportunity to avoid carbon lock-in by focusing on urban form that promotes low-carbon infrastructure and enables low-impact behaviour facilitated by co-located medium to high densities of jobs and housing, walkability, and transit-oriented development (Sections 8.6.2 and 8.6.3). For established cities, strategies include electrification of the grid and transport, and implementing energy efficiency across sectors (Section 8.6.1)."
"wg3_ch08_FAQ 8.3 |  	How do we estimate global emissions from cities, and how reliable are the estimates?_p1",NO_TITLE,"There are two different emissions estimation techniques applied, individually or in combination, to the four frameworks outlined in Section 8.1.6.2 to estimate urban GHG emissions: ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’. The top-down technique uses atmospheric GHG concentrations and atmospheric modelling to estimate direct (scope 1) emissions (see Glossary). The bottom-up technique estimates emissions using local activity data or direct measurements such as in smokestacks, traffic data, energy consumption information, and building use. Bottom-up techniques will often include indirect emissions (see Glossary) from purchased electricity (scope 2) and the urban supply chain (scope 3). Inclusion of supply-chain emissions often requires additional data such as consumer purchasing data and supply chain emission factors. Some researchers also take a hybrid approach combining top-down and bottom-up estimation techniques to quantify territorial emissions. Individual self-reported urban inventories from cities have shown chronic underestimation when compared to estimates using combined top-down/bottom-up atmospherically calibrated estimation techniques."
"wg3_ch08_FAQ 8.3 |  	How do we estimate global emissions from cities, and how reliable are the estimates?_p2",NO_TITLE,"No approach has been systematically applied to all cities worldwide. Rather, they have been applied individually or in combination to subsets of global cities. Considerable uncertainty remains in estimating urban emissions. However, top-down approaches have somewhat more objective techniques for uncertainty estimation in comparison to bottom-up approaches. Furthermore, supply chain estimation typically has more uncertainty than direct or territorial emission frameworks."
