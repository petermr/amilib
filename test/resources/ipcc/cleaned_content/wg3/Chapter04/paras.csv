wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter focuses on accelerating mitigation and on shifting development pathways to increased sustainability, based on literature particularly at national scale. While previous WGIII assessments have discussed mitigation pathways, focus on development pathways is more recent. The timeframe is the near term (now up to 2030) to mid-term (2030 to 2050), complementing Chapter 3 on the long term (from 2050 onward)."
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p2,NO_TITLE,"An emissions gap persists, exacerbated by an implementation gap, despite mitigation efforts including those in near-universal nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The ‘emissions gap’ is understood as the difference between the emissions with NDCs in 2030, and mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goals. In general, the term ‘implementation gap’ refers to the difference between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In this report, the term refers to the gap between mitigation pledges contained in national determined contributions, and the expected outcome of existing policies. There is considerable literature on country-level mitigation pathways, including but not limited to NDCs. Country distribution of this literature is very unequal (robust evidence,  high agreement). Current policies lead to median global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 57 GtCO2-eq with a full range of 52–60 by 2030. NDCs with unconditional and conditional elements 1  lead to 53 (50–57) and 50 (47–55) GtCO2-eq, respectively (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Table 4.3). This leaves estimated  emissions gaps in 2030 between projected outcomes of unconditional elements of NDCs and emissions in scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot of 19–26 GtCO2-eq, and 10–16 GtCO2-eq for scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action. When conditional elements of NDCs are included, these gaps narrow to 16–23 GtCO2-eq and 6–14 GtCO2-eq, respectively. {Cross-Chapter Box 4, Figure 1}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p3,NO_TITLE,"Studies evaluating up to 105 updated NDCs submitted by October 2021 indicate that emissions in conditional NDCs have been reduced by 4.5 (2.7–6.3)  GtCO2-eq, but only closes the emission gaps by about one-third to 2°C and about 20% to 1.5°C compared to the original NDCs submitted in 2015/16 (medium evidence, medium agreement). The magnitude of these emission gaps calls into question whether current development pathways and efforts to accelerate mitigation are adequate to achieve the Paris mitigation objectives. In addition, an implementation gap exists between the projected emissions of ‘current policies’ and the projected emissions resulting from the implementation of the unconditional and conditional elements of NDCs, and is estimated to be around and 7 GtCO2-eq in 2030, respectively (medium evidence, medium agreement), with many countries requiring additional policies and associated climate action to meet their autonomously determined mitigation targets as specified under the first NDCs (limited evidence). There is, furthermore, a potential difference between mitigation targets set in NDCs ex ante and what is achieved ex post . A limited number of studies assess the implementation gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity building support. The disruptionstriggered by the COVID-19 epidemic increase uncertainty over range of projections relative to pre-COVID-19 literature. As indicated by a growing number of studies at the national and global level, how large near- to mid-term emissions implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are, to a large degree depends on how stimulus or recovery packages are designed. {4.2, 4.2.2.5, Cross-Chapter Box 4}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p4,NO_TITLE,"Given the gaps, there is a need to explore accelerated mitigation (relative to NDCs and current policies). There is increasing understanding of the technical content of accelerated mitigation pathways, differentiated by national circumstances, with considerable though uneven literature at country-level (medium evidence,  high agreement). Transformative technological and institutional changes for the near term include demand reductions through efficiency and reduced activity, rapid decarbonisation of the electricity sector and low-carbon electrification of buildings, industry and transport (robust evidence, medium agreement). A focus on energy use and supply is essential, but not sufficient on its own – the land sector and food systems deserve attention. The literature does not adequately include demand-side options and systems analysis, and captures the impact from non-CO2GHGs with medium confidence. Countries and regions will have different starting points for transition pathways. Some factors include climate conditions resulting in different heating and cooling needs, endowments with different energy resources, patterns of spatial development, and political and economic conditions. {4.2.5}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p5,NO_TITLE,"Accelerated mitigation alone may run into obstacles. If such obstacles are rooted in underlying structural features of society, then transforming such structures helps remove obstacles, which amounts to shifting development pathways. Various actors have developed an increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050 (mid-term). A growing number of such strategies aim at net zero GHG or CO2 emissions, but it is not yet possible to draw global implications due to the limited size of sample (medium evidence, low agreement). Non-state actors are also engaging in a wide range of mitigation initiatives. When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub-national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could reduce up to about 20 GtCO2-eq in 2030 (limited evidence, medium agreement). Yet perceived or real conflicts between mitigation and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found to have significant implications for development objectives and macroeconomic costs at country level. For example, most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation(robust evidence,  high agreement). The literature finds that employment effect of mitigation policies tends to be limited on aggregate, but can be significant at sectoral level (limited evidence, medium agreement). Detailed design of mitigation policies is critical for distributional impacts and avoiding lock-in (robust evidence,  high agreement), though further research is needed in that direction. {4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.6}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p6,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development pathways towards sustainability offers ways to (i) broaden the range of levers and enablers that a society can use to provide enabling conditions and accelerate mitigation; and (ii) increase the chances of advancing at the same time towards mitigation and towards other development goals. The way countriesdevelop determines their capacity to accelerate mitigation and achieve other sustainable development objectives simultaneously (medium-robust evidence, medium agreement). Yet meeting ambitious mitigation and development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change, hence the focus on shifting development pathways (robust evidence, medium agreement). Though development pathways result from the actions of a wide range of actors, it is possible to shift development pathways through policies and enhancing enabling conditions (limited evidence, medium agreement). For example, policies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally conceived and implemented in the pursuit of overall societal development objectives, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. In some countries, such policies are framed as part of a just transition. However, they can have major influence on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options, as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway ‘Shifting Pathways’ (medium evidence, medium agreement). There are practical options to shift development pathways in ways that advance mitigation and other sustainable development objectives, supporting political feasibility, increase resources to meet multiple goals, and reduce emissions (limited evidence,  high agreement). Concrete examples assessed in this chapter include high employment and low emissions structural change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social contract, combining housing policies to deliver both housing and transport mitigation, and change economic, social and spatial patterns of development of the agriculture sector provide the basis for sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation. These examples differ by context. Examples in other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole economies and societies. Coordinated policy mixes would need to coordinate multiple actors – individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors – to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support mitigation and adaptation. Some studies explore the risks of high complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways. {4.3, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.1.7–4.4.1.10, Figure 4.7, Cross-Chapter Box 5, 5.8, Box 6.2, 8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5, Cross-Chapter Box 7, Cross-Chapter Box 12}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p7,NO_TITLE,"The literature identifies a broad set of enabling conditions that can both foster shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation, along five categories (medium evidence, high agreement). Policy integration is a necessary component of shifting development pathways, addressing multiple objectives. To this aim, mobilising a range of policies is preferable to single policy instruments (robust evidence,  high agreement). Governance for climate mitigation and shifting development pathways is enhanced when tailored to national and local contexts. Improved institutions and governance enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation gaps (medium evidence,  high agreement). Given that strengthening institutions may be a long term endeavour, it needs attention in the near ter m. Accelerated mitigation and shifting development pathways necessitates both redirecting existing financial flows from high- to low-emissions technologies and systems and to provide additional resources to overcome current financial barriers (robust evidence,  high agreement). Opportunities exist in the near term to close the finance gap. At the national level, public finance for actions promoting the SDG agenda helps broaden the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement). Changes in behaviour and lifestyles are important to move beyond mitigation as incremental change, and when supporting shifts to more sustainable development pathways will broadening the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement). The direction of innovation matters (robust evidence,  high agreement). The necessary transformational changes are likely to be more acceptable if rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and society within which they take place. {4.4.1, 4.4.1.2, 4.4.1.3, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.1.5, 4.4.1.6, Figure 4.8, 15.2.2}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p8,NO_TITLE,"Equity can be an important enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated mitigation,  dealing with the distribution of costs and benefits and how these are shared as per social contracts, national policy and international agreements. Transition pathways have distributional consequences such as large changes in employment and economic structure (robust evidence,  high agreement). In that regard, the just transition concept has become an international focal point tying together social movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon transitions. Effectiveness of cooperative action and the perception of fairness of such arrangements are closely related, in that pathways that prioritise equity and allow broad stakeholders participation can enable broader consensus for the transformational change implied by deeper mitigation efforts (robust evidence, medium agreement). Hence, equity is a concept that is instrumentally important. {4.5, Figure 4.9}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p9,NO_TITLE,"In sum, this chapter suggests that the immediate tasks are to broaden and deepen mitigation in the near term if the global community is to deliver emission reductions at the scale required to keep temperature well below 2°C and pursue efforts at 1.5°C. Deepening mitigation means more rapid decarbonisation. Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability (SDPS) broadens the scope of mitigation. Putting the enabling conditions above in place supports both. Depending on context, some enabling conditions such as shifting behaviour may take time to establish, underscoring the importance of early action. Other enabling conditions, such as improved access to financing, can be put in place in a relatively short time frame, and can yield results rapidly."
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p10,NO_TITLE,"Accelerating mitigation: The literature points to well-understood policy measures and technologies for accelerating mitigation, though the balance depends on country specificities: (i) decarbonising electricity supply to produce net zero CO2, including renewable energy, (ii) radically more efficient use of energy than today; (iii) electrification of end-uses including transport; (iv) dramatically lower use of fossil fuels than today; (v) converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; (vi) promote bioenergy, demand reduction, dietary changes, and policies, incentives, and rules for mitigation in the land sector; and (vii) setting and meeting ambitious targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers. Charting just transitions to net zero may provide a vision, which policy measures can help achieve. Though there is increasing experience with pricing carbon directly or indirectly, decision-makers might consider a broader toolbox of enablers and levers that is available in domains that have not traditionally been considered climate policy. {4.5, Annex II.IV.11}"
wg3_ch04_executive-summary_p11,NO_TITLE,"Broadening opportunities by focusing on development pathways and considering how to shift them: Some of the policy measures may yield rapid results, whereas other, larger transformations may take longer. If we are to overcome obstacles, a near-term priority is to put in place the enabling conditions to shifting development pathways to increased sustainability. Learning from the examples above, focusing on SDPS also provides a broader set of tools to accelerating mitigation and achieve other sustainable development goals. Consider climate whenever you make choices about development, and vice versa. {4.4.1}"
wg3_ch04_4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The recent IPCC Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) made clear that the next three decades are critical if we are to achieve the long-term mitigation goal of the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2018a). The present chapter assesses the literature on mitigation and development pathways over that timeframe, in the near (up to 2030) and mid-term (up to 2050)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"It considers three questions: (i) Where are we heading now? That is, what is the current state of affairs with respect to climate mitigation and how did we get here? (ii) Where do we want to go? For example, what state of affairs would meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? and (iii) How do we bring about this shift? In other words, what interventions are at societies’ disposal to bring about the necessary change in an equitable manner?"
wg3_ch04_4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Where are we heading now?Despite the drop in emissions due to the COVID-19 crisis, the gap between projected emissions based on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2030 and emissions pathways compatible with the long term temperature goal set in the Paris Agreement remains large (Section 4.2.2). In addition to this persistent emissions gap, we face an implementation gap, as current policies are insufficient to achieve mitigation targets in NDCs, and sufficient international support is not yet available to developing countries who have requested and quantified support needs. Continuing along a development pathway characterised by the same underlying drivers, structural obstacles and insufficient enabling conditions that led to high emissions will not address the problem (robust evidence, high agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The analysis of the gap is conducted together with Chapter 3 (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this chapter). Chapter 3 is working backward, assessing mitigation in the long term (beyond 2050 up to 2100) to draw the near- and mid-term implications of long-term temperature and mitigations goals. Chapter 4, on the other hand, works forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) (Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2) and from current development paths to assess the implications for near- and mid-term greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, cities, communities and non-state actors are taking leadership in implementing more ambitious action (Section 4.2.3). This chapter also assesses national low emission development strategies (Section 4.2.4)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Where do we want to go? Technical alternatives and policy options exist to bridge the emissions and implementation gaps, and the literature illustrates these with a wide range of accelerated techno-economic pathways that deepen decarbonisation closer to the pace and scale required (Section 4.2.5), and examines their impacts on other development objectives (Section 4.2.6). In practice, however, scaling up at the broader, deeper, and faster level required to meet climate goals while advancing other development objectives regularly faces prohibitive obstacles (Section 4.2.7). Mitigation policies grafted on to existing development pathways are unlikely to achieve rapid and deep emission reductions."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Secondly, even if carefully designed, climate policies to accelerate mitigation may have adverse consequences for other development objectives. As a complement to mitigation action, taking action to shift development pathways towards sustainability broadens the range of mitigation options, while increasing the possibility to meet other development priorities at the same time (medium evidence, high agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Development pathways and shifting them to increased sustainability are introduced in Chapter 1, and constitute a thread throughout the report (see ‘development pathways’ in Annex I: Glossary). The AR6 WGII Report highlights the related concept of climate resilient development pathways (AR6 WGII, Chapter 18). Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter – on shifting sustainable pathway towards sustainability – elaborates on the concept. The influence of development pathways on emissions and mitigative capacity is discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 assesses modelling of shifts in development pathways, illustrated by the illustrative mitigation pathway called ‘shifting pathways’. The importance of behavioural change as societies make decisions that intentionally shift their future development pathway is emphasised in Chapter 5. The systems Chapters (6–12) take sectoral perspectives, while pathways that are sustainable are the specific focus of Chapter 17."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"How can one shift development pathway and accelerate mitigation? The literature does not provide a complete handbook for shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation. The literature does, however, shed light on some of the underlying dynamics. Shifting development pathways can be necessitated by the existence of pervasive obstacles that prove prohibitive to reaching mitigation and other development objectives (Section 4.2.7). Deliberate measures taken to facilitate the shifting of development pathways and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling conditions that help overcome those obstacles (Figure 4.6) – improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change and technological innovation, designing and implementing adequate policy, and finance. Just transitions, while they will differ by context, are critical to identifying and avoiding or addressing inequitable distributive consequences (robust evidence, high agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Enabling conditions necessary to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways are discussed in depth in Chapters 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16. In addition, Chapters 13 and 14 detail the policy instruments that could help shift development pathways and accelerate the scale and pace of mitigation, while Chapter 4 describes those in broad strategies terms. Chapter 13 adds more texture on institutional and governance machinery; policy choice, design and implementation; as well as policy formulation processes, actors and structure across scales."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Since development pathways and mitigation options depend to large extent on national objectives and circumstances, this chapter is primarily concerned with literature at national level (or in the case of the European Union, at regional level), while Chapter 3 is primarily concerned with literature at global scale. The national scale selected in this chapter requires attention as national mitigation pathways cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (Box 4.2). This chapter is also concerned mostly with economy-wide development and mitigation pathways, as distinct from detailed sectoral work that is assessed in the systems Chapters 6 to 12. The present chapter also assesses literature on non-state action."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"Chapter 4 draws on five major strands of literature: (i) an emerging literature on development pathways – conceptual, empirical, and model-based, including at the national and sub-national scales; (ii) a rapidly expanding, model-based, literature on mitigation pathways in the near- and mid-term (Lepault and Lecocq 2021); (iii) studies of NDCs and mid-century strategies; (iv) a broader literature on transformation and shifts in development pathways, including from non-climate literatures; and (v) a significant literature on equity, including just transitions. This is supported by a database of country-level mitigation scenarios at country level assembled for the preparation of this chapter (Annex III, Table I.10 and I.11)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p12,NO_TITLE,"The chapter builds on past IPCC reports. In AR5, all mitigation pathways were assessed in a single chapter (Clarke et al. 2014), which focused mostly on the long term. IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) included a chapter on mitigation pathways compatible with the temperature goal in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018a), mostly at the global level. It also considered strengthening mitigation (de Coninck et al. 2018) in the context of poverty, inequality and sustainable development (Roy et al. 2018). Development pathways have also been explored, albeit less frequently, in past IPCC reports starting with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Some early framing of development pathways was included in the Third Assessment Report (Banuri et al. 2001), further developed in the Fourth Assessment Report (Sathaye et al. 2007). An extended discussion of climate change and equity was conducted in AR5 (Fleurbaey et al. 2014)."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p13,NO_TITLE,"Chapter 4 examines mitigation within the broader context of development pathways, and examines how shifting development pathways can have a major impact on mitigative capacity and broadening mitigation options. It is organised as follows."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p14,NO_TITLE,"Section 4.2 demonstrates that collective mitigation actions fall short of pathways that keep in reach the Paris temperature goals in the long term. Section 4.3 introduces development pathways (given its relative novelty in IPCC assessments), considers the implications of mitigation for development and vice versa, and articulates an approach on both accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p15,NO_TITLE,"Section 4.4 discusses how to shift development pathway and accelerate the scale and pace of mitigation, what levers are available to policymakers, and how policies may intersect with adaptation goals. It points out that development pathways also drive adaptation and adaptative capacity, and discusses various risks associated with shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation strategies."
wg3_ch04_4.1_p16,NO_TITLE,"Finally, equity and just transitions are recurring themes in the chapter, specifically in relation to accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways toward sustainability. In Section 4.2.2.7, equity is discussed in the context of Parties’ assertions regarding the fairness of their NDCs, alongside reflections from academic scholarship on the ethical underpinnings of these assertions and of various quantitative analyses of equitable effort-sharing. Section 4.2.6 discusses certain distributional implications of domestic mitigation efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections 4.2.7 and 4.3 note the relevance of potential distributional impacts as an obstacle to climate action, as well as the inequitable distribution of decision-making authority. Finally, Section 4.5 recognises the structural relationship between equity and climate, explores just transitions as an international focal point tying together social movements, trade unions, and other stakeholders, and thus an instrumental role in establishing consensus."
wg3_ch04_4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"A central instrument of the Paris Agreement is the NDCs, submitted by each country, and reflecting national efforts to reduce GHG emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Every five years, collective progress will be compared against long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Considering the outcome of a global stocktake, countries will prepare subsequent NDCs, showing progression in their ambition and enhancing international cooperation (UNFCCC 2015a)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Prior to COP21, in 2015, most countries submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which included mitigation targets for 2025 or 2030. INDCs become first NDCs on ratification and/or after national governments’ revision, and by 11 October 2021, the official NDC registry contained 194 first NDCs with 105 new and updated NDCs from 132 Parties to the Paris Agreement, covering 53% of the total global emissions in 2019 of 52.4 GtCO2-eq without land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), and 13 second NDCs. Most of the Parties that submitted new or updated NDCs have demonstrated increased ambition in addressing climate change. Moreover, though some countries have not submitted their updated NDCs yet, they have already announced their updated NDC goals somewhere. Countries will take the first stock in 2023 based on their progression towards achieving the objectives of Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015a, 2018a; SB Chairs 2021) (Section 14.3.2.5)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Submitted NDCs vary in content, scope and background assumptions. First NDCs contain mitigation targets, and in many cases also provisions about adaptation. The mitigation targets range from economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets to strategies, plans and actions for low-emission development. Baseline years vary from 1990 to 2015 and in almost all NDCs the targeted time frame is 2030, with a few specified periods of until 2025, 2035, 2040 or 2050. Around 43% of the mitigation targets in first NDCs are expressed in terms of deviation below business-as-usual by a specified target year, either for the whole economy or for specific sectors, while around 35% include fixed-level targets (either reductions or limitations compared to base years), and another 22% refer to intensity targets (in terms of GHG, CO2 or energy) or policies and measures, with an increasing number of Parties moving to absolute emission reduction targets in their new or updated NDCs (UNFCCC 2016a, 2021). Some developing countries’ NDCs include unconditional elements, while others include conditional ones, the latter with higher ambition if finance, technology and capacity building support from developed countries is provided (UNFCCC 2016a). 2 In some NDCs, the additional mitigation is quantified, in others not (Figure 14.2)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Most first NDCs cover all specific sectors, including LULUCF, and communicate specific targets for individual sub-sectors to support their overall mitigation targets. Concrete actions and priority areas are more detailed in the energy sector, with increased share of renewable energies and energy efficiency being highlighted in the majority of NDCs. Given the uncertainty behind LULUCF emission and removal accounting (Grassi et al. 2017; Jian et al. 2019), several countries state that their accounting framework will only be defined in later NDCs. The GHG included and the global warming potentials (GWPs) used to aggregate emissions also vary across NDCs. Most countries only refer to carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions aggregated based on IPCC AR2 or AR4 metrics, while few NDCs also include fluorinated gases and use IPCC AR5 GWPs. The shares of Parties that indicate possible use of at least one type of voluntary cooperation and set qualitative limits on their use have both nearly doubled in new or updated NDCs."
wg3_ch04_4.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"There is considerable literature on country-level mitigation pathways, including but not limited to NDCs. Country distribution of this literature is very unequal (robust evidence,  high agreement). In particular, there is a growing literature on (I)NDCs, with a wide scope which includes estimate of emissions levels of NDCs (Section 4.2.2.2); alignment with sustainable development goals (Caetano et al. 2020; Campagnolo and Davide 2019; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018); ambition (Höhne et al. 2018; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte 2017; Hermwille et al. 2019); energy development (Scott et al. 2018); and the legality of downgrading NDCs (Rajamani and Brunnée 2017). Other studies note that many NDCs contain single-year mitigation targets, and suggest that a multi-year trajectory is important for more rigorous monitoring (Elliott et al. 2017; Dagnet et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The literature also points out that beyond the ‘headline numbers’, information in (I)NDCs is difficult to analyse (Pauw et al. 2018). Information for ‘clarity, transparency and understanding’ is to be communicated with NDCs, although initial guidance was not specific (UNFCCC 2014). While the adoption of the Paris rule-book provided some greater specificity (UNFCCC 2018b,c), the information included in the NDCs remains uneven. Many NDCs omit important mitigation sectors and do not adequately provide details on costs and financing of implementation (Pauw et al. 2018). Countries are also invited to explain how their NDCs are fair and ambitious, though the way this has been done so far has been criticised as insufficiently rigorous (Winkler et al. 2018)."

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses on emissions projections are then discussed in Section 4.2.2.4 and the implications of updated NDCs submitted in 2020/21 on emissions follow in Section 4.2.2.5. Section 4.2.2.6 presents an assessment of the so-called ‘implementation gap’ between what currently implemented policies are expected to deliver and what the ambitions laid out under the full implementation of the NDCs are projected to achieve. Finally, a comparison of ambitions across different countries or regions (Section 4.2.2.7) is presented and the uncertainties of projected emissions associated with NDCs and current policies are estimated, including a discussion of measures to reduce uncertainties in the specification of NDCs (Section 4.2.2.8)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The literature reviewed in this section includes globally comprehensive assessments of NDCs and current policies, both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed (but not unpublished model results) as well as synthesis reports by the UNFCCC Secretariat, government reports and national studies."

wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"System modelling studies are conducted at global, regional and national scales. Global models provide an overview, are necessary for assessment of global phenomena (e.g., temperature change), can integrate climate models and trade effects. National models typically include more details on sectors, technology, behaviour and intersectoral linkages, but often use simplifying assumptions for international trade (e.g., the Armington elasticity approach). Critically, they can also better reflect local socio-economic and political conditions and their evolution (i.e., national development pathways). A variety of modelling paradigms are found, including optimisation and simulation models, myopic and with foresight, monolithic and modular (Annex III: Scenarios and Modelling Methods)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Among the hybrid approaches, three broader categories can be distinguished, (i) direct use of official emission projection as part of submitted NDC or other communication to UNFCCC, (ii) historical trend extrapolation of emissions based on inventory data, possibly disaggregated by sector and emission species, and (iii) use of Reference/Business-As-Usual pathways from an independent published study (e.g., IEA WEO). In all cases, the reductions are then estimated on top of the resulting emission trajectory. Note that globally comprehensive studies may vary the approach used depending on the country."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a number of dimensions, including (i) their spatial resolution and coverage, (ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are included in the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate them, the emissions inventory (official vs independent inventory data) and related accounting approaches used as a starting point for the projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, etc.), and (v) the degree to which individual policies and their impact on emissions are explicitly represented (Table 4.1)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging from macro-scale regions with globally comprehensive coverage to national level (Section 4.2.2.3) and sub-national and company level in a few cases (Section 4.2.3). It is important to recognise that globally comprehensive studies typically resolve a limited number of countries individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, but have poor resolution of remaining countries or regions, which are assessed in aggregate terms. Conversely, studies with high resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the global scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts to provide a composite global picture from detailed national studies (Bataille et al. 2016a; Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project 2015; Roelfsema et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"A second dimension in which the studies are different is their comprehensiveness of covering different emitting sectors. Some studies focus on the contribution of a single sector, for example the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector (Fyson and Jeffery 2019; Grassi et al. 2017) or the energy system (including both energy supply and demand sectors), to emission reductions as specified in the NDC. Such studies give an indication of the importance of a given sector to achieving the NDC target of a country and can be used as a benchmark to compare to comprehensive studies, but adding sectoral contributions up represents a methodological challenge."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Third, GHG coverage is different across studies. Some focus on CO2 only, while others take into account the full suite of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). For the latter, different metrics for aggregating GHGs to a CO2-equivalent metric are being used, typically GWP 100 from different IPCC assessments (Table 4.1)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Fourth, studies typically cover a set of scenarios, though how these scenarios are defined varies widely. The literature reporting IAM results often includes Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which are officially communicated, and Current Policies (CP) as interpreted by modellers. Studies based on national modelling, by contrast, tend to define scenarios reflecting very different national contexts. In both cases, modellers typically include so-called No Policy Baseline scenarios (alternatively referred to as Reference or Business-as-Usual scenarios) which do not necessarily reflect currently implemented policies and thus are not assessed as reference pathways (Section 4.2.6.1). There are also various approaches to considering more ambitious action compared to the CP or NDC projections that are covered in addition."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Fifth, studies differ in the way they represent policies (current or envisioned in NDCs), depending on their internal structure. For example, a subsidy to energy efficiency in buildings may be explicitly modelled (e.g., in a sectoral model that represents household decisions relative to building insulation), represented by a proxy (e.g., by an exogenous decrease in the discount rate households use to make choices), or captured by its estimated outcome (e.g., by an exogenous decrease in the household demand for energy, say in an energy system model or in a compact CGE). Detailed representations (such as the former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate results than compact ones (the latter example), but the set of assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be very different."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p13,NO_TITLE,"Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just implementing high level targets specified in policy documents and NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact on emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and policies at sub-national level. In addition, in countries with rapidly evolving policy environments, slightly different cut-off dates for the policies considered in an emission projection can make a significant difference for the results (Dubash et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.2.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"The challenges described above are dealt with in the assessment of quantitative results in Section 4.2.2.3 by (i) comparing national studies with country-level results from global studies to understand systematic biases; (ii) comparing economy-wide emissions (including AFOLU) as well as energy-related emissions; (iii) using different emission metrics including CO2 and Kyoto GHG emissions where the latter have been harmonised to using AR6 GWP100 metrics; and (iv) tracking cut-off dates of implemented policies and NDCs used in different references (Table 4.SM.1). The most notable differences in quantitative emission estimates related to current policies and NDCs relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications and to the updated NDCs mostly submitted since early 2020 which are separately dealt with in Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.5, respectively."

The evidence base for the updated NDC assessment is thus considerably smaller compared to that of the assessment of emissions implications of original NDCs presented in Section 4.2.2.3.

In addition to the updates of NDC targets, most of the new studies also include impacts of COVID-19 on future emission levels (as discussed in Section4.2.2.4) which may have led to considerable downward revisions of emission trends unrelated to NDCs.

wg3_ch04_4.2.2.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Various assessment frameworks have been proposed to analyse fair share ranges for NDCs. The literature on equity frameworks including quantification of national emissions allocation is assessed in section 4.5 (Sections 13.4.2, 14.3.2 and 14.5.3). Recent literature has assessed equity, analysing how fairness is expressed in NDCs in a bottom-up manner (Mbeva and Pauw 2016; Cunliffe et al. 2019; Winkler et al. 2018). Some studies compare NDC ambition level with different effort sharing regimes and which principles are applied to various countries and regions (Peters et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2017; Robiou Du Pont et al. 2017; Holz et al. 2018; Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019). Others propose multi-dimensional evaluation schemes for NDCs that combine a range of indicators, including the NDC targets, cost-effectiveness compared to global models, recent trends and policy implementation into consideration (Aldy et al. 2017; Höhne et al. 2018). Yet other literature evaluates NDC ambition against factors such as technological progress of energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies (Jiang et al. 2017; Kuramochi et al. 2017; Wakiyama and Kuramochi 2017), synergies with adaptation plans (Fridahl and Johansson 2017), the obligations to deploy carbon dioxide removal technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the future implied by their near-term emission reductions where they are not reflected on in the first NDCs (Peters and Geden 2017; Fyson et al. 2020; Pozo et al. 2020; Mace et al. 2021). Others identify possible risks of unfairness when applying GWP* as emissions metric at national scale (Rogelj and Schleussner 2019). A recent study on national fair shares draws on principles of international environmental law, excludes approaches based on cost and grandfathering, thus narrowing the range of national fair shares previously assessed, and apply this to the quantification of national fair share emissions targets (Rajamani et al. 2021)."

The UNEP Gap Report (UNEP 2017a) discusses uncertainties of NDC estimates in some detail. The main factors include variations in overall socio-economic development; uncertainties in GHG inventories; conditionality; targets with ranges or for single years; accounting of biomass; and different GHG aggregation metrics (e.g., GWP values from different IPCC assessments). In addition, when mitigation effort in NDCs is described as measures that do only indirectly translate into emission reductions, assumptions necessary for the translation come into play (Doelle 2019).

Some authors consider this to be a lack of a strong guarantee that mitigation targets in NDCs will be implemented (Nemet et al. 2017). Others point to growing extent of national legislation to provide a legal basis for action (Iacobuta et al. 2018) (Section 13.2).

Methodological differences in the accounting of the LULUCF anthropogenic CO2 sink between scientific studies and national GHG inventories (as submitted to UNFCCC) further complicate the comparison and aggregation of emissions of NDC implementation (Grassi et al. 2018, 2021) (Section 7.2.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7). This uncertainty could be reduced with clearer guidelines for compiling future NDCs, in particular when it comes to mitigation efforts not expressed as absolute economy-wide targets (Doelle 2019), and explicit specification of technical details, including energy accounting methods, harmonised emission inventories (Rogelj et al. 2017) and finally, increased transparency and comparability (Pauw et al. 2018)."

While the NDCs mostly state targets, countries are also obliged to pursue domestic mitigation measures to achieve the objectives.

First, the implementation gap between ‘current policies’ and unconditional and conditional NDCs is estimated to be around 4 and 7 GtCO2-eq in 2030, respectively (Section 4.2.2 and Tables 4.2 and 4.3). Second, the comparison of unconditional (conditional) NDCs and long-term mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower gives rise to a 2030 median emissions gap of 19–26 GtCO2-eq (16–23 GtCO2-eq) for limiting end-of-century warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and 10–16 GtCO2-eq (6–14 GtCO2-eq) for limiting warming to 2°C (>67%). 5 GHG emissions of NDCs are broadly consistent with 2030 emission levels of cost-effective long-term pathways staying below 2.5°C (scenarios category C5, Table 3.2, Chapter 3)."

(Roelfsema et al. 2020). The same authors estimate an energy intensity improvement gap 10% and 18% for 2030 between current policies pathways and 2°C and 1.5°C pathways, respectively. SEI et al. (2020) estimates the ‘fossil fuel production gap’, by which they mean ‘the level of countries’ planned fossil fuel production expressed in their carbon content to be 120% and 50% higher compared to the fossil fuel production consistent with 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, respectively, as assessed in IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018a)."

wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-4_p13,NO_TITLE,It is important to note that such comparisons are less straight forward as the link between long-term temperature goals and these indicators is less pronounced compared to the emission levels themselves; they are therefore associated with greater uncertainty compared to the emissions gap.

wg3_ch04_box-4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Working Group II contribution to this Assessment finds that the overall extent of adaptation-related responses in human systems is low ( high confidence) and that there is limited evidence on the extent to which adaptation-related responses in human systems are reducing climate risk (O’Neill et al. 2020). Thus there is an adaptation gap (UNEP 2018a), and bridging that gap requires enablers including institutional capacity, planning and investment (UNEP 2016). Estimates of adaptation costs vary greatly across studies. Recent studies based on climate change under RCP8.5 report adaptation costs for developing countries of up to 400 billion (300 billion in RCP2.6) USD2005 in 2030 (New et al. 2020). Of the NDCs submitted in 2015, 50 countries estimated adaptation costs of USD39 billion annually. Both public and private finance for adaptation is increasing, but remains insufficient and constitutes a small fraction (4–8%) of total climate finance which is mostly aimed at mitigation. The pledge of developed countries of mobilising finance for developing countries to address adaptation needs globally as part of the Paris Agreement are insufficient. By 2030 the adaptation needs are expected to be three to six times larger than what is pledged, further increasing towards 2050 (UNEP 2016; New et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The decision adopting the Paris Agreement stresses the importance of ‘stronger and more ambitious climate action’ by non-government and sub-national stakeholders, ‘including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and other sub-national authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples’ (UNFCCC 2015a). The Marrakech Partnership for Global Action, launched in the 2016 UNFCCC Conference of Parties by two ‘high-level champions,’ further formalised the contributions of non-government and sub-national actors taking action through seven thematic areas (e.g., energy, human settlements, industry, land-use, etc.) and one cross-cutting area (resilience). Since then, non-state actors, for example, companies and civil society, and sub-national actors, such as cities and regions, have emerged to undertake a range of largely voluntary carbon mitigation actions (Hsu et al. 2018, 2019) both as individual non-state actors (NSAs in the following) and through national and international cooperative initiatives, or ICIs (Hsu et al. 2018). ICIs take a variety of forms, ranging from those that focus solely on non-state actors to those that engage national and even local governments. They can also range in commitment level, from primarily membership-based initiatives that do not require specific actions to those that require members to tackle emissions reductions in specific sectors or aim for transformational change."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Quantification of the (potential) impact of these actions is still limited. Almost all studies estimate the potential impact of the implementation of actions by NSAs and ICIs, but do not factor in that they may not reach their targets. The main reason for this is that there is very limited data currently available from individual actors (e.g., annual GHG inventory reports) and initiatives to assess their progress towards their targets. A few studies have attempted to assess progress of initiatives by looking into the initiatives’ production of relevant outputs (Chan et al. 2018). Quantification does not yet cover all commitments and only a selected number of ICIs are analysed in the existing literature. Most of these studies exclude commitments that are not (self-)identified as related to climate change mitigation, those that are not connected to international networks, or those that are communicating in languages other than English."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Non state action could make significant contributions to achieving the Paris climate goals (limited evidence,  high agreement). However, efforts to measure the extent to which non-state and sub-national actors go beyond national policy are still nascent (Hsu et al. 2019; Kuramochi et al. 2020) and we do not fully understand the extent to which ambitious action by non-state actors is additional to what national governments intend to do. Sub-national and non-state climate action may also have benefits in reinforcing, implementing, or piloting national policy, in place of or in addition to achieving additional emissions reductions (Broekhoff et al. 2015; Heidrich et al. 2016; Hsu et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Quantification of commitments by individual NSAs are limited to date. Attempts to quantify aggregate effects in 2030 of commitments by individual non-state and sub-national actors are reported by (Hsu et al. 2019; Kuramochi et al. 2020). Kuramochi et al. (2020) estimate potential mitigation by more than 1,600 companies, around 6,000 cities and many regions (cities assessed have a collective population of 579 million, and regions 514 million). Individual commitments by these sub-national regions, cities and companies could reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by 1.2 to 2.0 GtCO2-eq yr –1 compared to current national policies scenario projections, reducing projected emissions by 3.8–5.5% in 2030, if commitments are fully implemented and do not lead to weaker mitigation actions by others (Figure 4.1 left). In several countries, NSA commitments could potentially help meet or exceed national mitigation targets."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Quantification of potential emission reductions from international cooperative initiatives have been assessed in several studies, and recently synthesised (Hsu et al. 2020; Lui et al. 2021), with some initiatives reporting high potential. In Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1, we report estimates of the emissions reductions from 19 distinct sub-national and non-state initiatives to mitigate climate change. The table shows wide ranges of potential mitigation based on current, target or potential membership, as well as a wide diversity of actors and membership assumptions. Current membership reflects the number of non-state or sub-national actors that are presently committed to a particular initiative; while targeted or potential membership represents a membership goal (e.g., increasing from 100 to 200 members) that an initiative may seek to achieve (Kuramochi et al. 2020). When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub-national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could reduce up to about 20 Gt of CO2-eq in 2030 (limited evidence, medium agreement). Chapter 8 also presents data on the savings potential of cities and it suggests that these could reach 2.3 GtCO2-eq annually by 2030 and 4.2 GtCO2-eq annually for 2050."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Non-state action may be broader than assessed in the literature so far, though subject to uncertainty. The examples in Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1 do not include initiatives that target the emissions from religious organisations, colleges and universities, civic and cultural groups, and, to some extent, households, and in this sense may underestimate sub-national potential for mitigating emissions, rather than overestimate it. That said, the estimates are contingent on assumptions that sub-national and non-state actors achieve commitments – both with respect to mitigation and in some cases membership – and that these actions are not accounted for in nor lead to weakening of national actions."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Care is to be taken not to depict these efforts as additional to action within national NDCs, unless this is clearly established (Broekhoff et al. 2015). There are potential overlaps between individual NSAs and ICIs, and across ICIs. Kuramochi et al. (2020) propose partial and conservative partial effect methods to avoid double counting when comparing ambition, a matter that merits further attention. As the diversity of actions increased, the potential to count the same reductions multiple times increases."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Equally important to note here is that none of the studies reviewed in Figure 4.1 quantified the potential impact of financial sector actions, for example, divestment from emission intensive activities (Section 15.3 has a more detailed discussion of how financial actors and instruments are addressing climate change). Moreover, only a limited number of studies on the impact of actions by diverse actors go beyond 2050 (Table 4.4), which may reflect analysts’ recognition of the increasing uncertainties of longer time horizons. Accurate accounting methods can help to avoiding counting finance multiple times, and methods across mitigation and finance would consider counting carbon market flows and the tons reduced. As Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1 indicate, activities by businesses have potential to significantly contribute to global mitigation efforts. For example, the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) encourages companies to pledge to reduce their emissions at rates which according to SBTi would be compatible with global pathways to well below 2°C or 1.5°C, with various methodologies being proposed (Andersen et al. 2021; Faria and Labutong 2019). Readers may note, however, that the link between emissions by individual actors and long-term temperature goals cannot be inferred without additional assumptions (Box 4.2). In the energy sector, some voluntary initiatives are also emerging to stop methane emissions associated with oil and gas supply chains. The Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) is a voluntary initiative lead by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which has recently published a comprehensive framework for methane detection, measurement and reporting (UNEP 2020b)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"Initiatives made up of cities and sub-national regions have an especially large potential to reduce emissions, due to their inclusion of many actors, across a range of different geographic regions, with ambitious emissions reduction targets, and these actors’ coverage of a large share of emissions (Kuramochi et al. 2020). Hsu et al. (2019) find largest potential in that area. Several sub-national regions like California and Scotland have set zero emission targets (Höhne et al. 2019), supported by short- and medium-term interim goals (Scottish Government 2020b; State of California 2018). Sharing of effort across global and sub-global scales has not been quantified, though one study suggests that non-state actors have increasingly adopted more diverse framings, including vulnerability, human rights and transformational framings of justice (Shawoo and McDermott 2020). Initiatives focused on forestry have high emissions reduction potential due to the current high deforestation rates, and due to the ambitious targets of many of these forestry initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Forests’ goal to end deforestation by 2030 (Höhne et al. 2019; Lui et al. 2021), although the Initiative acknowledges that insufficient progress has to-date been made towards this goal (NYDF Assessment Partners 2020). On the other hand, uncertainties in global forest carbon emissions (and therefore potential reductions) are high and despite a multitude of initiatives in the sector, actually measured deforestation rates have not declined since the initiative was announced in 2014 (Sections 7.2 and 7.3.1). Moreover, not all initiatives are transparent about how they plan to reach their goals and may also rely on offsets."
wg3_ch04_4.2.3_p11,NO_TITLE,"Initiatives focused on non-CO2 emissions, and particularly on methane, can achieve sizable reductions, in the order of multiple GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Table 4.4). The Global Cement and Concrete Association (formerly the Cement Sustainability Initiative), has contributed to the development of consistent energy and emissions reporting from member companies. The CSI also suggested possible approaches to balance GHG mitigation and the issues of competitiveness and leakage (Cook and Ponssard 2011). The member companies of the GCCA (CSI) have become better prepared for future legislation on managing GHG emissions and developed management competence to respond to climate change compared to non-member companies in the cement sector (Busch et al. 2008; Global Cement and Concrete Association 2020). Accordingly, the cement industry has developed some roadmaps to reach net zero GHG around 2050 (Sanjuán et al. 2020)."

Without additional information, such denomination is incorrect. Working Group I reaffirmed ‘with high confidence the AR5 finding that there is a near-linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the global warming they cause’ (WGI SPM AR6). It is not the function of any single country’s mitigation efforts, nor any individual actor’s. Emission pathways of individual countries or sectors in the near to mid-term can only be linked to a long-term temperature with additional assumptions specifying (i) the GHG emissions and removals of other countries up the mid-term; and (ii) the GHG emissions and removals of all countries beyond the near and mid-term. For example, a national mitigation pathway can be labelled ‘2°C compatible’ if it derives from a global mitigation pathway consistent with 2°C via an explicit effort sharing scheme across countries (Sections 4.2.2.6 and 4.5)."

Their sectoral analysis aims in 2050 at negative CO2 emissions in the energy sector, and near-zero emissions in the buildings and transport sectors, requiring energy efficiency improvement and electrification. To do so, drastic mitigation is introduced immediately, and, as a result, the mitigation target of Japan’s current NDC is considered not sufficient to achieve a 1.5°C scenario. Jiang et al.

In the early stages, the national emission pathways were mainly assessed in the developed countries such as Germany, UK, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada, and USA. For example, the Enquete Commission in Germany identified robust and sustainable 80% emission reduction pathways (Deutscher Bundestag 2002). In Japan, 2050 Japan Low-Carbon Society scenario team (2008) assessed the 70% reduction scenarios in Japan, and summarised the necessary measures to ‘Dozen Actions towards Low-Carbon Societies’."

wg3_ch04_4.2.4.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Prior to COP21, most of the literature on mid-century mitigation pathways at the national level was dedicated to pathways compatible with a 2°C limit (see Box 4.2 for a discussion on the relationship between national mitigation pathways and global, long-term targets). After COP21 and the IPCC SR1.5, literature increasingly explored just transition to net zero emissions around 2050. This literature reflects on low-emissions development strategies (cognate with SDPS, Section 4.3.1) and policies to get to net zero CO2 or GHG emissions (Garg and Waisman 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter)."

For a selected set of countries, it shows the mid-century emission pathways at national scale that have been registered in the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) national mitigation scenario database built for the purpose of this Report (Annex III.3.3). Overall, the database contains scenarios for 50 countries. Total GHG emission are the most comprehensive information to assess the pathways on climate mitigation actions, but energy-related CO2 emissions are the most widely populated data in the scenarios. As a result, Figure 4.2 shows energy-related CO2 emission trajectories. Scenarios for EU countries show reduction trends even in the reference scenario, whereas developing countries and non-European developed countries such as Japan and USA show emissions increase in the reference. In most countries plotted onFigure 4.2, studies have found that reaching net zero energy related CO2 emissions by 2050 is feasible, although the number of such pathways is limited."

For Japan, Oshiro et al. (2018) shows the difference between the implications of a 2°C scenario (80% reduction of CO2 in 2050) and a 1.5°C scenario (net zero CO2 emission in 2050), suggesting that for a net zero CO2 emission scenario, BECCS is a key technology. Their sectoral analysis aims in 2050 at negative CO2 emissions in the energy sector, and near-zero emissions in the buildings and transport sectors, requiring energy efficiency improvement and electrification. To do so, drastic mitigation is introduced immediately, and, as a result, the mitigation target of Japan’s current NDC is considered not sufficient to achieve a 1.5°C scenario. Jiang et al. (2018) also show the possibility of net negative emissions in the power sector in China by 2050, indicating that biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (CCS) must be adopted on a large scale by 2040. Samadi et al. (2018) indicate the widespread use of electricity-derived synthetic fuels in end-use sectors as well as behavioural change for the 1.5°C scenario in Germany."

Unlike the studies mentioned in the previous paragraph, they translate the 1.5°C goal by introducing in their model a carbon price trajectory estimated by global models as sufficient to achieve the 1.5°C target. Because of the high economic growth and increase of GHG emissions in the reference case, CO2 emissions in 2050 do not reach zero. Finally, the literature also underlines that to achieve a 1.5°C target, mitigation measures relative to non-CO2 emissions become important, especially in developing countries where the share of non-CO2 emissions is relatively high.

They entail increased end-use energy efficiency, significant increases in low-carbon energy, electrification, other new and transformative technologies in demand sectors, adoption of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to reduce gross emissions, and contribution to net negative emissions through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon sinks. For these pathways to be realised, the literature assumes higher carbon prices, combined in policy packages with a range of other policy measures."

Specific policies, measures and technologies are needed to reach such targets. These include, broadly, decarbonising electricity supply, including through low-carbon energy, radically more efficient use of energy than today; electrification of end-uses (including transport/electric vehicles); dramatically lower use of fossil fuels than today; converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; and setting ambitious targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.5.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Accelerated mitigation pathways differ by countries, depending inter alia on sources of emissions, mitigation opportunities and economic context. In China, India, Japan and other Southeast Asian countries, more aggressive action related to climate change is also motivated by regional concerns over health and air quality related to air pollutants and SLCFs (Ashina et al. 2012; Aggarwal 2017; Kuramochi et al. 2017; Xunzhang et al. 2017; Dhar et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018; Oshiro et al. 2018; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019; Khanna et al. 2019). Studies of accelerated mitigation pathways in North America tend to focus on power sector and imported fuel decarbonisation in the US , and on electrification and demand-side reductions in Canada (Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Hodson et al. 2018; Victor et al. 2018; Bahn and Vaillancourt 2020; Hammond et al. 2020; Jayadev et al. 2020). In Latin America, many pathways emphasise supply-side mitigation measures, finding that replacing thermal power generation and developing bioenergy (where resources are available) utilisation offers the greatest mitigation opportunities (Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Arango-Aramburo et al. 2019; Delgado et al. 2020; Lap et al. 2020). The European Union member states (EU-28) recently announced 2050 climate neutrality goal is explored by pathways that emphasise complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity generated by low-carbon sources, particularly renewables; demand reductions through efficiency and conservation, and novel fuels and end-use technologies (Prognos et al. 2020). The limited literature so far on Africa’s future pathways suggest those could be shaped by increasing energy access and mitigating the air pollution and health effects of relying on traditional biomass use, as well as cleaner expansion of power supply alongside end-use efficiency improvements (Hamilton and Kelly 2017; Oyewo et al. 2019, 2020; Ven et al. 2019; Wright et al. 2019; Forouli et al. 2020)."

Some studies provide cost optimal electricity mix under emission constraints, while others explicitly explore a 100% renewables or 100% emission free electricity sector (Box 4.3)."

Others state that challenges exist with speed of expansion, ensuring sufficient supply at all times or higher costs compared to other alternatives (Clack et al. 2017).

wg3_ch04_box-4.3_p1,Bioenergy Plays Significant Role in Resource Abundant Countries in Latin America and Parts of Europe ,"Many accelerated mitigation pathways include high shares of renewable energy, with national variations. In Europe, some argue that the EU 2050 net zero GHG emissions goal can be met with 100% renewable power generation, including use of renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, biofuels (including imports), and synthetic hydrocarbons, but will require significant increases in transmission capacity (Duscha et al. 2019; Zappa et al. 2019). Capros et al. (2019) explore a 1.5°C compatible pathway that includes 85% renewable generation, with battery, pumped hydro, and chemical storage for variable renewables. High-renewable scenarios also exist for individual Member States. In France, for example, Krakowski et al. (2016) propose a 100% renewable power generation scenario that relies primarily on wind (62%), solar PV (26%) and oceans (12%). To reach this aim, integration into the European grid is of vital importance (Brown et al. 2018). While debated, incremental costs could be limited regardless of specific assumptions of future costs of individual technologies (Shirizadeh et al. 2020). In Germany, similarly, 100% renewable electricity systems are found feasible by numerous studies (Oei et al. 2020; Thomas Klaus et al. 2010; Wuppertal-Institut 2021; Hansen et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_box-4.3_p2,Bioenergy Plays Significant Role in Resource Abundant Countries in Latin America and Parts of Europe ,"In South Africa, it is found that long-term mitigation goals could be achieved with accelerated adoption of solar PV and wind generation, if the electricity sector decarbonises by phasing-out coal entirely by 2050, even if CCS is not feasible before 2025 (Altieri et al. 2015; Beck et al. 2013). Abundant solar PV and wind potential, coupled with land availability suggest that more than 75% of power generation could ultimately originate from solar PV and wind (Oyewo et al. 2019; Wright et al. 2019)."

BECCS in the power sector is also considered cost-effective option for supply-side mitigation (Borba et al. 2012; Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; Lucena et al. 2016)."

Domestic biomass alone can help Germany meet its 95% CO2 reduction by 2050 goal, and biomass and CCS together are needed to reduce CO2 by 80% by 2050 in the Netherlands (Mikova et al. 2019). Studies suggest that mitigation efforts in France include biofuels and significant increases in biomass use, including up to 45% of industry energy by 2050 for its net GHG neutrality goal (Doumax-Tagliavini and Sarasa 2018; Capros et al. 2019). Increased imports may be needed to meet significant increases in EU’s bioenergy use, which could affect energy security and the sustainability of bioenergy production outside of the EU (Mandley et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2020)."

The effectiveness of BECCS could depend on local contexts, choice of biomass, fate of initial aboveground biomass and fossil-fuel emissions offsets – carbon removed through BECCS could be offset by losses due to land-use change (Harper et al. 2018; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021). Large-scale BECCS may push planetary boundaries for freshwater use, exacerbate land-system change, significantly alter biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows (Heck et al. 2018; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Stenzel et al. 2021; Ai et al. 2021).

Overall, (van der Zwaan et al. 2016) estimate that 33–50% of total electricity generation in Latin America could be ultimately covered by CCS. In Japan, CCS and increased bioenergy adoption plus waste-to-energy and hydrogen-reforming from fossil fuel are all considered necessary in the power sector in existing studies, with potential up to 200 MtCO2 yr –1 (Ashina et al. 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a; Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Sugiyama et al. 2021). In parts of the EU, after 2030, CCS could become profitable with rising CO2 prices (Schiffer 2015). CDR is seen as necessary in some net GHG neutrality pathways (Capros et al. 2019) but evidence on cost-effectiveness is scarce and uncertain (European Commission 2013). For France and Sweden, (Millot et al. 2020) include CCS and BECCS to meet net zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Under 1.5°C pathway, an analysis found China would need full CCS coverage of the remaining 12% of power generation from coal and gas power and 250 GW of BECCS (Jiang et al. 2018). Combined with expanded renewable and nuclear development, total estimated investment in this study is 5% of China’s total GDP in 2020, 1.3% in 2030, and 0.6% in 2050 (Jiang et al. 2016)."

Some limitations of CCS, including uncertain costs, lifecycle and net emissions, other biophysical resource needs, and social acceptance are acknowledged in existing studies (Viebahn et al. 2014; Jacobson 2019; Mathur and Shekhar 2020; Sekera and Lichtenberger 2020)."

Furthermore, mitigation deterrence may create further uncertainty, as anticipated future CDR could dilute incentives to reduce emissions now (Grant et al. 2021), and the political economy of net negative emissions has implications for equity (Mohan et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.5.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Nuclear power generation is developed in many countries, though larger-scale national nuclear generation does not tend to associate with significantly lower carbon emissions (Sovacool et al. 2020). Unlike other energy sources such as wind and PV solar, levelised costs of nuclear power has been rising in the last decades (Grubler 2010; Gilbert et al. 2017; Portugal-Pereira et al. 2018). This is mainly due to overrun of overnight construction costs related to delays in project approvals and construction, and more stringent passive safety measures, which increases the complexity of systems. After the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan, nuclear programs in several countries have been phased out or cancelled (Carrara 2020; Huenteler et al. 2012; Kharecha and Sato 2019; Hoffman and Durlak 2018).

In the USA, (Victor et al. 2018) build a scenario in which nuclear contributes 23% of CO2 emission reductions needed to reduce GHG emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. Deep power sector decarbonisation pathways could require a two-folded increase in nuclear capacity according to (Jayadev et al. 2020) for the USA, and nearly a ten-fold increase for Canada, but may be difficult to implement (Vaillancourt et al. 2017). For China to meet a 1.5°C pathway or achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, nuclear may represent 14–28% of power generation in 2050 according to (Jiang et al. 2018; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019). For South Korea, Hong et al. (2014) and Hong and Brook (2018) find that increasing nuclear power can help complement renewables in decarbonising the grid. Similarly, India has put in place a three-stage nuclear programme which aims to enhance nuclear power capacity from the current level of 6 GW to 63 GW by 2032, if fuel supply is ensured (GoI 2015). Nuclear energy is also considered necessary as part of accelerated mitigation pathways in Brazil, although it is not expected to increase significantly by 2050 even under stringent low-carbon scenarios (Lucena et al. 2016). France developed its nuclear strategy in response to energy security concerns after the 1970s oil crisis, but has committed to reducing nuclear’s share of power generation to 50% by 2035 (Millot et al. 2020). Conversely, some analysis find deep mitigation pathways, including net zero GHG emissions and 80–90% reduction from 2013 levels, feasible without additional nuclear power in EU-28 and Japan respectively, but assuming a combination of bio- and novel fuels and CCS or land-use based carbon sinks (Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Duscha et al. 2019)."

Cooling appliances are expected to increase from 3.6 billion to 9.5 billion by 2050, though up to 14 billion could be required to provide adequate cooling for all (Birmingham Energy Institute 2018). Current technology pathways are not sufficient to deliver universal access to cooling or meet the 2030 targets under the SDGs, but energy efficiency, including in equipment efficiency like air conditioners, can reduce this demand and help limit additional emissions that would further exacerbate climate change (Biardeau et al. 2020; Dreyfus et al. 2020; UNEP and IEA 2020).

The Kigali Amendment and related national and regional regulations are projected to reduce future radiative forcing from HFCs by about half in 2050 compared to a scenario without any HFC controls, and to reduce future global average warming in 2100 from a baseline of 0.3°C–0.5°C to less than 0.1°C, according to a recent scientific assessment of a wide literature (World Meteorological Organization 2018). If ratified by signatories, the rapid phase-down of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment is possible because of extensive replacement of high-global warming potential (GWP) HFCs with commercially available low-GWP alternatives in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. Each country’s choices of alternative refrigerants will likely be determined by energy efficiency, costs, and refrigerant toxicity and flammability.

For the EU-28 to reach net carbon neutrality, complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity (up to 65% share), district heating, and direct use of solar and ambient heat are projected to be needed for buildings, along with increased use of solar thermal and heat pumps for heating (Duscha et al. 2019). In the UK and Canada, improved insulation to reduce energy demand and efficient building appliances and heating systems are important building strategies needed to reduce emissions to zero by 2050 (Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Chilvers et al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2018a). In Ireland, achieving 80–95% emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 also requires changes in building energy technology and efficiency, including improving building envelopes, fuel switching for residential buildings, and replacing service-sector coal use with gas and renewables according to (Chiodi et al. 2013). In South Africa, improving industry and building energy efficiency is also considered a key part of mitigation strategies (Altieri et al. 2016; Ouedraogo 2017)."

The EU, Japan and the USA (the latter for public buildings only) have set targets for shifting new buildings to 100% near-zero energy buildings by 2030, with earlier targets for public buildings. Scotland has a similar target for 2050 (Höhne et al. 2020). Technologies identified as needed for achieving near-zero energy buildings vary by region, but include energy-efficient envelope components, natural ventilation, passive cooling and heating, high performance building systems, air heat recovery, smart and information and communication technologies, and changing future heating and cooling supply fuel mixes towards solar, geothermal, and biomass (Mata et al. 2020). Sub-national regions in Spain, USA, Germany, and Mexico have set local commitments to achieving net zero carbon new buildings by 2050, with California having the most ambitious aspirational target of zero net energy buildings for all new buildings by 2030 (Höhne et al. 2020). The EU is also targeting the retrofitting of 3% of existing public buildings to zero-energy, with emphasis on greater thermal insulation of building envelopes (Höhne et al. 2020; Mata et al. 2020). China’s roadmaps have emphasised insulation of building envelope, heat recovery systems in combination with renewable energy, including solar, shallow geothermal, and air source heat pumps (Mata et al. 2020)."

In Japan, accelerated mitigation pathways consider the use of information technology and internet of things (IoT) to transform human behaviour and transition to a sharing economy (Ashina et al. 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a, 2018).

Because of their short lifetimes (days to a decade and a half), SLCFs can provide fast mitigation, potentially avoiding warming of up to 0.6°C at 2050 and up to 1.2°C at 2100 (Ramanathan and Xu 2010; Xu and Ramanathan 2017). In Asia especially, co-benefits of drastic CO2 and air pollution mitigation measures reduce emissions of methane, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and fine particulate matter by approximately 23%, 63%, 73%, 27%, and 65% respectively in 2050 as compared to 2010 levels.

Measures to reduce methane emissions from anthropogenic sources are considered intractable – where they sustain livelihoods – but also becoming more feasible, as studies report the options for mitigation in agriculture without undermining food security (Wollenberg et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2017; Nisbet et al. 2020). The choice of emission metrics has implications for SLCF (Cain et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2).

SLCF mitigation measures can have regional impacts, including avoiding premature deaths in Asia and Africa and warming in central and northern Asia, southern Africa, and the Mediterranean (Shindell et al. 2012). Reducing outdoor air pollution could avoid 2.4 million premature deaths and 52 million tonnes of crop losses for four major staples (Haines et al. 2017). Existing research emphasises climate and agriculture benefits of methane mitigation measures with relatively small human health benefits (Shindell et al. 2012). Research also predicts that black carbon mitigation could substantially benefit global climate and human health, but there is more uncertainty about these outcomes than about some other predictions (Shindell et al. 2012). Other benefits to SLCF reduction include reducing warming in the critical near term, which will slow amplifying feedbacks, reduce the risk of non-linear changes, and reduce long-term cumulative climate impacts – like sea-level rise – and mitigation costs (Hu et al. 2017; UNEP and WMO 2011; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Xu and Ramanathan 2017; Shindell et al. 2012)."

Using fewer building materials could reduce the need for cement, steel, and other materials and thus the need for production and freight transport. Concrete can also be produced from low-carbon cement, or designed to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Few regions have developed comprehensive policies or strategies for a circular economy, with the exception of the EU and China, and policies in the EU have only emerged within the last decade.

The effectiveness of BECCS could depend on local contexts, choice of biomass, fate of initial aboveground biomass and fossil-fuel emissions offsets – carbon removed through BECCS could be offset by losses due to land-use change (Harper et al. 2018; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021).

Overall, (van der Zwaan et al. 2016) estimate that 33–50% of total electricity generation in Latin America could be ultimately covered by CCS. In Japan, CCS and increased bioenergy adoption plus waste-to-energy and hydrogen-reforming from fossil fuel are all considered necessary in the power sector in existing studies, with potential up to 200 MtCO2 yr –1 (Ashina et al. 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a; Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Sugiyama et al. 2021).

Some limitations of CCS, including uncertain costs, lifecycle and net emissions, other biophysical resource needs, and social acceptance are acknowledged in existing studies (Viebahn et al. 2014; Jacobson 2019; Mathur and Shekhar 2020; Sekera and Lichtenberger 2020)."

Unlike other energy sources such as wind and PV solar, levelised costs of nuclear power has been rising in the last decades (Grubler 2010; Gilbert et al. 2017; Portugal-Pereira et al. 2018). This is mainly due to overrun of overnight construction costs related to delays in project approvals and construction, and more stringent passive safety measures, which increases the complexity of systems. After the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan, nuclear programs in several countries have been phased out or cancelled (Carrara 2020; Huenteler et al. 2012; Kharecha and Sato 2019; Hoffman and Durlak 2018).

Deep power sector decarbonisation pathways could require a two-folded increase in nuclear capacity according to (Jayadev et al. 2020) for the USA, and nearly a ten-fold increase for Canada, but may be difficult to implement (Vaillancourt et al. 2017). For China to meet a 1.5°C pathway or achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, nuclear may represent 14–28% of power generation in 2050 according to (Jiang et al. 2018; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019). For South Korea, Hong et al. (2014) and Hong and Brook (2018) find that increasing nuclear power can help complement renewables in decarbonising the grid. Similarly, India has put in place a three-stage nuclear programme which aims to enhance nuclear power capacity from the current level of 6 GW to 63 GW by 2032, if fuel supply is ensured (GoI 2015). Nuclear energy is also considered necessary as part of accelerated mitigation pathways in Brazil, although it is not expected to increase significantly by 2050 even under stringent low-carbon scenarios (Lucena et al. 2016). France developed its nuclear strategy in response to energy security concerns after the 1970s oil crisis, but has committed to reducing nuclear’s share of power generation to 50% by 2035 (Millot et al. 2020). Conversely, some analysis find deep mitigation pathways, including net zero GHG emissions and 80–90% reduction from 2013 levels, feasible without additional nuclear power in EU-28 and Japan respectively, but assuming a combination of bio- and novel fuels and CCS or land-use based carbon sinks (Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Duscha et al. 2019)."

The Kigali Amendment and related national and regional regulations are projected to reduce future radiative forcing from HFCs by about half in 2050 compared to a scenario without any HFC controls, and to reduce future global average warming in 2100 from a baseline of 0.3°C–0.5°C to less than 0.1°C, according to a recent scientific assessment of a wide literature (World Meteorological Organization 2018). If ratified by signatories, the rapid phase-down of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment is possible because of extensive replacement of high-global warming potential (GWP) HFCs with commercially available low-GWP alternatives in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. Each country’s choices of alternative refrigerants will likely be determined by energy efficiency, costs, and refrigerant toxicity and flammability. National and regional regulations will be needed to drive technological innovation and development (Polonara et al. 2017)."

For the EU-28 to reach net carbon neutrality, complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity (up to 65% share), district heating, and direct use of solar and ambient heat are projected to be needed for buildings, along with increased use of solar thermal and heat pumps for heating (Duscha et al. 2019). In the UK and Canada, improved insulation to reduce energy demand and efficient building appliances and heating systems are important building strategies needed to reduce emissions to zero by 2050 (Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Chilvers et al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2018a). In Ireland, achieving 80–95% emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 also requires changes in building energy technology and efficiency, including improving building envelopes, fuel switching for residential buildings, and replacing service-sector coal use with gas and renewables according to (Chiodi et al. 2013).

The EU, Japan and the USA (the latter for public buildings only) have set targets for shifting new buildings to 100% near-zero energy buildings by 2030, with earlier targets for public buildings. Scotland has a similar target for 2050 (Höhne et al. 2020). Technologies identified as needed for achieving near-zero energy buildings vary by region, but include energy-efficient envelope components, natural ventilation, passive cooling and heating, high performance building systems, air heat recovery, smart and information and communication technologies, and changing future heating and cooling supply fuel mixes towards solar, geothermal, and biomass (Mata et al. 2020). Sub-national regions in Spain, USA, Germany, and Mexico have set local commitments to achieving net zero carbon new buildings by 2050, with California having the most ambitious aspirational target of zero net energy buildings for all new buildings by 2030 (Höhne et al. 2020). The EU is also targeting the retrofitting of 3% of existing public buildings to zero-energy, with emphasis on greater thermal insulation of building envelopes (Höhne et al. 2020; Mata et al. 2020). China’s roadmaps have emphasised insulation of building envelope, heat recovery systems in combination with renewable energy, including solar, shallow geothermal, and air source heat pumps (Mata et al. 2020)."

Because of their short lifetimes (days to a decade and a half), SLCFs can provide fast mitigation, potentially avoiding warming of up to 0.6°C at 2050 and up to 1.2°C at 2100 (Ramanathan and Xu 2010; Xu and Ramanathan 2017). In Asia especially, co-benefits of drastic CO2 and air pollution mitigation measures reduce emissions of methane, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and fine particulate matter by approximately 23%, 63%, 73%, 27%, and 65% respectively in 2050 as compared to 2010 levels.

Measures to reduce methane emissions from anthropogenic sources are considered intractable – where they sustain livelihoods – but also becoming more feasible, as studies report the options for mitigation in agriculture without undermining food security (Wollenberg et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2017; Nisbet et al. 2020). The choice of emission metrics has implications for SLCF (Cain et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2).

SLCF mitigation measures can have regional impacts, including avoiding premature deaths in Asia and Africa and warming in central and northern Asia, southern Africa, and the Mediterranean (Shindell et al. 2012). Reducing outdoor air pollution could avoid 2.4 million premature deaths and 52 million tonnes of crop losses for four major staples (Haines et al. 2017). Existing research emphasises climate and agriculture benefits of methane mitigation measures with relatively small human health benefits (Shindell et al. 2012). Research also predicts that black carbon mitigation could substantially benefit global climate and human health, but there is more uncertainty about these outcomes than about some other predictions (Shindell et al. 2012). Other benefits to SLCF reduction include reducing warming in the critical near term, which will slow amplifying feedbacks, reduce the risk of non-linear changes, and reduce long-term cumulative climate impacts – like sea-level rise – and mitigation costs (Hu et al. 2017; UNEP and WMO 2011; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Xu and Ramanathan 2017; Shindell et al. 2012)."

Using fewer building materials could reduce the need for cement, steel, and other materials and thus the need for production and freight transport. Concrete can also be produced from low-carbon cement, or designed to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Few regions have developed comprehensive policies or strategies for a circular economy, with the exception of the EU and China, and policies in the EU have only emerged within the last decade.

wg3_ch04_4.2.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"A significant part of the literature assesses the impacts of mitigation on GDP, consistent with policymakers’ interest in this variable. It must be noted upfront that computable equilibrium models, on which our assessments are mostly based, capture the impact of mitigation on GDP and other core economic variables while typically overlooking other effects that may matter (like improvements in air quality). Second, even though GDP (or better, GDP per capita) is not an indicator of welfare (Fleurbaey and Blanchet 2013), changes in GDP per capita across countries and over time are highly correlated with changes in welfare indicators in the areas of poverty, health, and education (Gable et al. 2015). The mechanisms linking mitigation to GDP outlined below would remain valid even with alternative indicators of well-being (Section 5.2.1). Third, another stream of literature criticises the pursuit of economic growth as a goal, instead advocating a range of alternatives and suggesting modelling of post-growth approaches to achieve rapid mitigation while improving social outcomes (Hickel et al. 2021). In the language of the present chapter, these alternatives constitute alternative development pathways."
wg3_ch04_4.2.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference (robust evidence,  high agreement), for example (Nong et al. 2017) for Australia, (Chen et al. 2013) for Brazil, (Dai et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Dong et al. 2018; Mu et al. 2018a; Zhao et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) for China, (Álvarez-Espinosa et al. 2018) for Colombia, (Fragkos et al. 2017) for the EU, (Mittal et al. 2018) for India, (Fujimori et al. 2019) for Japan, (Veysey et al. 2014) for Mexico, (Pereira et al. 2016) for Portugal, (Alton et al. 2014; van Heerden et al. 2016) for South Africa, (Chunark et al. 2017) for Thailand, (Acar and Yeldan 2016) for Turkey, (Roberts et al. 2018b) for the UK, (Zhang et al. 2017; Chen and Hafstead 2019) for USA, (Nong 2018) for Vietnam (Figure 4.4). The downward relationship between mitigation effort and emissions is strong in studies up to 2030, much weaker for studies looking farther ahead. In all reviewed studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation. It may be noted that none of the studies assessed above integrates the benefits of mitigation in terms of reduced impacts of climate change or lower adaptation costs. This is not surprising since these studies are at national or regional scale and do not extend beyond 2050, whereas the benefits depend on global emissions and primarily occur after 2050.

wg3_ch04_4.2.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Two major mechanisms interplay to explain the impact of mitigation on GDP. First, the carbon constraint imposes reduced use of a production factor (fossil energy), thus reducing GDP. In the simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households reduce their use of GHG-intensive goods and services in response to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive investment elsewhere (Fujimori et al. 2019), except in Keynesian models in which increased public investment actually boosts GDP (Pollitt et al. 2015; Landa Rivera et al. 2016; Bulavskaya and Reynès 2018). Magnitude and duration of GDP loss depend on the stringency of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-GHG-intensive goods and services, assumptions about costs of low-carbon technologies and their evolution over time (e.g., Duan et al. 2018; van Meijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) and decisions by trading partners, which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; Fragkos et al. 2017) ( high evidence, high agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"In the near term, presence of long-lived emissions intensive capital stock, and rigidities in the labour market (Devarajan et al. 2011) and other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP. In the mid-term, on the other hand, physical and human capital, technology, institutions, skills or location of households and activities are more flexible. The development of renewable energy may help create more employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill labour market (Helgenberger, S. et al., 2019). In addition, cumulative mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts of mitigation on GDP."
wg3_ch04_4.2.6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Country-level studies find that the negative impacts of mitigation on GDP can be reduced if pre-existing economic or institutional obstacles are removed in complement to the imposition of the carbon constraint (robust evidence,  high agreement). For example, if the carbon constraint takes the form of a carbon tax or of permits that are auctioned, the way the proceeds from the tax (or the revenues from the sales of permits) are used is critical for the overall macroeconomic impacts (Chen et al. 2013). (For a detailed discussion of different carbon pricing instruments, including the auctioning of permits, see Section 13.6.3)."

wg3_ch04_4.2.6.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"More generally, mitigation costs can be reduced by proper policy design if the economy initially is not on the efficiency frontier (Grubb 2014), defined as the set of configurations within which the quality of the environment and economic activity cannot be simultaneously improved given current technologies – such improvements in policy design may include reductions in distortionary taxes. Most of the studies which find that GDP increases with mitigation in the near term precisely assume that the economy is initially not on the frontier. Making the economy more efficient – in other words, lifting the constraints that maintain the economy in an interior position – creates opportunities to simultaneously improve economic activity and reduce emissions. Table 4.9 describes the underlying assumptions in a selection of studies."

Comparing numbers across countries is not straightforward due to exchange rate fluctuations, differing assumptions by modellers in individual country studies, etc. The database of national mitigation pathways assembled for this Report – which covers only a fraction of available national mitigation studies in the literature – shows that marginal costs of mitigation are positive, with a median value of 101 USD2010 tCO2–1 in 2030, 244 in 2040 and 733 in 2050 for median mitigation efforts of 21%, 46% and 76% relative to business-as-usual respectively. Marginal costs increase over time along accelerated mitigation pathways, as constraints become tighter, with a non-linearity as mitigation reaches 80% of reference emissions or more.

wg3_ch04_4.2.6.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Numerous studies have analysed the potential impact of carbon pricing on labour markets. Chateau et al. (2018) and OECD (2017a) find that the implementation of green policies globally (defined broadly as policies that internalise environmental externalities through taxes and other tools, shifting profitability from polluting to green sectors) need not harm total employment, and that the broad skill composition (low, high- and medium-skilled jobs) of emerging and contracting sectors is very similar, with the largest shares of job creation and destruction at the lowest skill level. To smoothen the labour market transition, they conclude that it may be important to reduce labour taxes, to compensate vulnerable households, and to provide education and training programs, the latter making it easier for labour to move to new jobs. Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact of scenarios with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) find relatively small (positive or negative) impacts on aggregate global employment that are more positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial losses for sectors and regions that today are heavily dependent on fossil fuels (Arndt et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2019; Vandyck et al. 2016; Jacobson et al. 2019). Among worker categories, low-skilled workers tend to suffer wage losses as they are more likely to have to reallocate, something that can come at a cost in the form of a wage cut (assuming that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who already work in the sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in labour taxes often leads to the most positive employment outcomes while lump-sum (uniform per-capita) transfers to households irrespective of income yield a more egalitarian outcome."

(2017) for the EU, and Mu et al. (2018b) for China. On the other hand, sectoral reallocations away from fossil-dependent sectors may be substantial, see for example, Alton et al. (2014) for South Africa or Huang et al. (2019) for China. Targeting of investment to labour-intensive green sectors may generate the strongest employment gains, see, for example, Perrier and Quirion (2018) for France, van Meijl et al. (2018) for the Netherlands, and Patrizio et al. 2(018) for the USA.

Second, the mitigation may disproportionally affect low-skilled workers (see previous section). Distributional issues have been identified not only with explicit price measures (carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with subsidies for renewables (Borenstein and Davis 2016), and efficiency and emissions standards (Davis and Knittel 2019; Bruegge et al. 2019; Levinson 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019)."

(2019) find that, in countries with a per-capita income of up to USD15,000 per capita (purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted), carbon pricing has a progressive impact on income distribution and that there may be an inversely U-shaped relationship between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering carbon pricing regressive in high-income countries, in other words, in countries where the capacity to pursue compensatory policies tends to be relatively strong."
wg3_ch04_4.2.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"The literature finds that the detailed design of mitigation policies is critical for their distributional impacts (robust evidence,  high agreement). For example, Vogt-Schilb et al. (2019) suggest to turn to cash transfer programs, established as some of the most efficient tools for poverty reduction in developing countries. In an analysis of Latin America and the Caribbean, they find that allocation of 30% of carbon revenues would suffice to compensate poor and vulnerable households on average, leaving the rest for other uses. This policy tool is not only available in countries with relatively high per-capita incomes: in Sub-Saharan Africa, where per-capita incomes are relatively low, cash transfer programs have been implemented in almost all countries (Beegle et al. 2018, p. 57), and are found central to the success of energy subsidy reforms (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). In the same vein, Böhringer et al. (2021) finds that recycling of revenues from emissions pricing in equal amounts to every household appeals as an attractive strategy to mitigate regressive effects and thereby make stringent climate policy more acceptable on societal fairness grounds. However, distributional gains from such recycling may come at the opportunity cost of not reaping efficiency gains from reductions in the taxes that are most distortionary (Goulder et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Distributional concerns related to climate mitigation are also prevalent in developed countries, as demonstrated, for instance, by France’s recent yellow-vest movement, which was ignited by an increase in carbon taxes. It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the distributional effects of carbon pricing, it is not sufficient to consider vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at different incomes levels but also horizontal redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at similar incomes which is due to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel consumption). Compared to vertical redistribution, it is more difficult to devise policies that effectively address horizontal redistribution (Cronin et al. 2019; Pizer and Sexton 2019; Douenne 2020). However, it has been shown ex post that transfer schemes considering income levels and location could have protected or even improved the purchasing power of the bottom half of the population (Bureau et al. 2019). Investments in public transportation may reduce horizontal redistribution if it makes it easier for households to reduce fossil fuel consumption when prices increase (see Sections 4.4.1.5 and 4.4.1.9). Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (Charlier et al. 2019). From a different angle, public acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have been enhanced via a public information campaign could have raised public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (Douenne and Fabre 2020). (See Section 4.4.1.8 for a discussion of this and other factors that influence public support for carbon taxation.)"
wg3_ch04_4.2.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"As outlined in Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 there is improved understanding since AR5 of what accelerated mitigation would entail in the coming decades. A major finding is that accelerated mitigation pathways in the near to mid-term appear technically and economically feasible in most contexts. Chapter 4, however, cannot stop here. Section 4.2.2 has documented an important policy gap for current climate pledges, and Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this chapter shows an even larger ambition gap between current pledges and what would be needed in the near term to be on pathways consistent with below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. In other words, while the implementation of mitigation policies to achieve updated NDC almost doubles the mitigation efforts, and notwithstanding the widespread availability of the necessary technologies, this doubling of effort merely narrows the gap to pathways consistent with 2°C by at most 20%."
wg3_ch04_4.2.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Obstacles to the implementation of accelerated mitigation pathways can be grouped in four main categories (Table 4.10). The first set of arguments can be understood through the lens of cost-benefit analysis of decision-makers, as they revolve around the following question: Are costs too high relative to benefits? More precisely, are the opportunity costs – in economics terms, what is being forfeited by allocating scarce resources to mitigation – justified by the benefits for the decision-maker (whether individual, firm, or nation)? This first set of obstacles is particularly relevant because accelerated mitigation pathways imply significant effort in the short-run, while benefits in terms of limited warming accrue later and almost wholly to other actors. However, as discussed in Sections 3.6 and 4.2.6, mitigation costs for a given mitigation target are not carved in stone. They strongly depend on numerous factors, including the way mitigation policies have been designed, selected, and implemented, the processes through which markets have been shaped by market actors and institutions, and nature of socially- and culturally-determined influences on consumer preferences. Hence, mitigation choices that might be expressed straightforwardly as techno-economic decisions are, at a deeper level, strongly conditioned by underlying structures of society."
wg3_ch04_4.2.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"A second set of likely obstacles in the short-term to accelerated mitigation revolves around undesirable distributional consequences, within and across countries. As discussed in Section 4.2.6.3, the distributional implications of climate policies depend strongly on their design, the way they are implemented, and on the context into which they are inserted. Distributional implications of climate policies have both ethics and equity dimensions, to determine what is desirable/acceptable by a given society in a given context, notably the relative power of different winners and losers to have their interests taken into account, or not, in the relevant decision-making processes. Like costs, distributional implications of accelerated mitigation are rooted in the underlying socio-political-institutional structures of a society."
wg3_ch04_4.2.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"A third set of obstacles are about technology availability and adoption. Lack of access even to existing cost-effective mitigation technologies remains an important issue, particularly for many developing countries, and even in the short-term. Though it relates most directly to techno-economic costs, technology availability raises broader issues related to the socio-technical systems within which innovation and adoption are embedded, and issues of technology availability are inherently issues of systemic failure (Section 16.3). The underlying legal, economic and social structures of the economy are central to the different stages of socio-transition processes (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16)."
wg3_ch04_4.2.7_p5,NO_TITLE,"The last set of obstacles revolves around the unsuitability of existing structures to accelerated mitigation. We include here all forms of established structures, material (e.g., physical capital) or not (institutions, social norms, patterns of individual behaviour), that are potentially long-lived and limit the implementation of accelerated mitigation pathways. Typically, such structures exist for reasons other than climate change and climate mitigation, including the distribution of power among various actors. Modifying them in the name of accelerated climate mitigation thus requires to deal with other non-climate issues as well. For example, resolving the landlord-tenant dilemma, an institutional barrier to the deployment of energy efficiency in building, opens fundamental questions on private property in buildings."
wg3_ch04_4.2.7_p6,NO_TITLE,"Acommon thread in the discussion above is that the obstacles to accelerated mitigation are to a large degree rooted in the underlying structural features of societies. As a result, transforming those underlying structures can help to remove those obstacles, and thus facilitate the acceleration of mitigation. This remark is all the more important that accelerated mitigation pathways, while very different across countries, all share three characteristics: speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction achieving more ambitious targets. Transforming those underlying structures amounts to shifting a society’s development pathway (Figure 4.6). In the following Sections 3 and 4, we argue that it is thus necessary to recast accelerated mitigation in the broader context of shifting development pathways, and that doing so opens up additional opportunities to (i) overcome the obstacles outlined above, and also (ii) combine climate mitigation with other development objectives."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The term development pathway is defined in various ways in the literature, and these definitions invariably refer to the evolution over time of a society’s defining features. A society’s development pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety of perspectives, capturing a range of possible features, trends, processes, and mechanisms. It can be examined in terms of specific quantitative indicators, such as population, urbanisation level, life expectancy, literacy rate, GDP, carbon dioxide emission rate, average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described with reference to trends and shifts in broad socio-political or cultural features, such as democratisation, liberalisation, colonisation, globalisation, consumerism, etc. Or, it can be described in a way that highlights and details a particular domain of interest; for example, as an ‘economic pathway’, ‘technological pathway’, ‘demographic pathway’, or others. Any such focused description of a pathway is more limited, by definition, than the general and encompassing notion of a development pathway."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Development pathways represent societal evolution over time, and can be assessed retrospectively and interpreted in a historical light, or explored prospectively by anticipating and assessing alternative future pathways. Development pathways, and prospective development pathways in particular, can reflect societal objectives, as in ‘low-emission development pathways’, ‘climate-resilient development pathways’, ‘sustainable development pathways’, ‘inclusive development pathway’, and as such can embed normative assumptions or preferences, or can reflect potential dystopian futures to be avoided. A national development plan (Section 4.3.2) is a representation of a possible development pathway for a given society reflecting its objectives, as refracted through its development planning process."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,One approach for exploring shifts in future development pathways is through scenarios. Some examples of scenario exercises in the literature are provided in Table 4.11.
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Different narratives of development pathways can have distinct and even competing focuses such as economic growth, shifts in industrial structure, technological determinism, and can embody alternative framings of development itself (from growth to well-being, see Chapter 5), and of sustainable development in particular (Sections 1.6 and 17.1). Scenario exercises are structured undertakings to explore alternative future development pathways, often drawing on stakeholder input and accepting the deep and irreducible uncertainty inherent in societal development into the future (Schweizer and Kriegler 2012; Kahane 2012; Raskin and Swart 2020). The results of scenario explorations, including modelling exercises, thus help clarify the characteristics of a particular future pathway, in light of a particular set of assumptions and choice of indicators for assessment. Processes of developing scenarios can inform choices by decision makers of various kinds."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Scenarios are useful to clarify societal objectives, understand constraints, and explore future shifts. Scenario exercises are effective when they enable multi-dimensional assessment, and accommodate divergent normative viewpoints (Kowarsch et al. 2017). Such processes might take into account participants’ explicit and implicit priorities, values, disciplinary backgrounds, and world views. The process of defining and describing a society’s development pathway contributes to the ongoing process of understanding, explaining and defining the historical and contemporary meaning and significance of a society. The imagination of facilitated stakeholder process combined with the rigour of modelling helps improve understanding of constraints, trade-offs, and choices. ‘Scenario analysis offers a structured approach for illuminating the vast range of possibilities. A scenario is a story, told in words and numbers, describing the way events might unfold. If constructed with rigor and imagination, scenarios help us to explore where we might be headed, but more, offering guidance on how to act now to direct the flow of events toward a desirable future’ (Raskin et al. 2002). Scenario processes are valuable for the quantitative and qualitative insights they can provide, and also for the role they can play in providing a forum and process by which diverse institutions and even antagonistic stakeholders can come together, build trust, improve understanding, and ultimately converge in their objectives (Kane and Boulle 2018; Dubash 2021)."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Development pathways evolve as the result of the countless decisions and actions at all levels of societal structure, as well due to the emergent dynamics within and between institutions, cultural norms, socio-technological systems, and the biogeophysical environment.

wg3_ch04_4.3.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The SDGs provide a lens on diverse national and local development objectives. Humankind currently faces multiple sustainability challenges that together present global society with the challenge of assessing, deliberating, and attempting to bring about a viable, positive future development pathway. Ecological sustainability challenges include reducing GHG emissions, protecting the ozone layer, controlling pollutants such as aerosols and persistent organics, managing nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, etc. (Steffen et al. 2015), which are necessary to address the rising risks to biodiversity and ecosystem services on which humanity depends (IPBES 2019a). Socio-economic sustainability challenges include conflict, persistent poverty and deprivation, various forms of pervasive and systemic discrimination and deprivation, and socially corrosive inequality. The global adoption of the SDGs and their underlying indicators (UN 2017, 2018 and 2019) reflect a negotiated prioritisation of these common challenges."

The lines illustrate different possible development pathways through time, some of which (shown here toward the top of the figure) remove obstacles to the adoption and effective implementation of sustainable development policies, and thus give access to a rich policy toolbox for accelerating mitigation and achieving SDGs. Other development pathways (shown here toward the bottom of the figure) do not overcome, or even reinforce the obstacles to adopting and effectively implementing sustainable development policies, and thus leave decision-makers with more limited policy toolbox (Section 4.2.7 and Figure 4.6). A richer tool box enables faster, deeper and broader mitigation."

Some of these choices fall clearly within the domain of mitigation policy. For example, what level carbon price, if any, should be imposed? Should fossil fuel subsidies be removed? Most decisions, of course, fall outside the direct domain of mitigation policy. Shifting development pathways toward sustainability involves this broader realm of choices beyond mitigation policy per se, and requires identifying those choices that are important determinants of the existing obstacles to accelerating mitigation and meeting other SDGs. Addressing these choices coherently shifts the development pathway away from a continuation of existing trends."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development pathways aims to influence the ultimate drivers of emissions (and development generally), such as the systemic and cultural determinants of consumption patterns, the political systems and power structures that govern decision-making, the institutions and incentives that guide and constrain socio-technical innovation, and the norms and information platforms that shape knowledge and discourse, and culture, values and needs (Raskin et al. 2002). These ultimate drivers determine the mitigative capacity of a society."
wg3_ch04_4.3.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Decision-makers might usefully consider a broader palette of policies and measures as part of an overall strategy to meet climate goals and other sustainable development goals (Section 4.3.2 and Table 4.12). This is consistent with the fact that mitigation is increasingly understood to be inseparable from broader developmental goals, which can be facilitated by policy coherence and integration with broader objectives and policies sectorally and societally. This is supported by other observations that mitigation measures based on conventional climate policy instruments, such as emissions taxes or permits, price incentives such as feed-in tariffs for low-carbon electricity generation, and fuel economy standards, and building codes, which aim to influence the proximate drivers of emissions alone will not achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement (Méjean et al. 2015; Rogelj et al. 2016; IPCC 2018a; UNEP 2018).

Addressing them calls for interventions affecting fundamental, interconnected, structural features of global society (International Panel on Social Progress 2018; TWI2050 – The World in 2050 2018), such as to our physical infrastructure (e.g., energy, water, industrial, urban infrastructure) (Waage et al. 2015; Adshead et al. 2019; Chester 2019; Mansell et al. 2019; Thacker et al. 2019; ), our societal institutions (e.g., educational, public health, economic, innovation, and political institutions) (Ostrom 2010; Kläy et al. 2015; Messner 2015; Sachs et al. 2019), and behavioural and cultural tendencies (e.g., consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and inequitable power structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations imply that attempt to address each SDG in isolation, or as independent technical challenges, would be insufficient, as would incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing the SDGs is likely to mean significant disruption of long-standing trends and transformative progress to shift development pathways to meet al. the SDGs, including climate action, beyond incremental changes targeted at addressing mitigation objectives in isolation. In other words, mitigation conceived as incremental change is not enough. Transformational change has implications for equity in its multiple dimensions ( Steffen and Stafford Smith 2013; Klinsky et al. 2017a; Leach et al. 2018) including just transitions (Section 4.5)."

Multiple objectives range from poverty eradication to providing energy access, addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving health, cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining growth and providing jobs, among others. For example, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across many countries, such as Brazil (Grottera et al. 2017), Indonesia (Irfany and Klasen 2017), India (GoI 2015), South Africa (Winkler 2018) and other low- and middle-income countries (Dorband et al. 2019). Reducing inequality relates not only to income, but also to other dimensions such as in access to energy services (Tait 2017), gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles (Andrijevic et al. 2020), and thereby assumes relevance in both developing and developed countries. The development priorities of many poor countries and communities with low capacities to adapt, has been focused more on reducing poverty, providing basic infrastructure, education and improving health, rather than on mitigation (Chimhowu et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Governments are increasingly resorting to the development of national plans to build institutions, resources, and risk/shock management capabilities to guide national development.

The comeback of planning may be linked to increased consideration given to sustainability, which is by construction forward-looking and far ranging, and therefore requires state and civil society to prepare and implement plans at all levels of governance. Governments are increasingly engaging in the development and formulation of national plans in an organised, conscious and continual attempt to select the best available alternatives to achieve specific goals."

Various initiatives such as the World Summit for Children in 1990; the Heavily Indebted Poor Country initiative that started offering debt relief in exchange for commitments by beneficiary states to invest in health, education, nutrition and poverty reduction in 1996; and push towards Comprehensive Development Frameworks seem to have catalysed the development of national actions plans across countries to estimate, measure and track investments and progress towards SDGs."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the earlier ones in terms of their approach. Complexity science has over the years argued for new forms of planning based on contingency, behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (Colander and Kupers 2016; Ramalingam, 2013), and new plans have increasingly focused on increasing resilience of individuals, organisations and systems (Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013). Finally, alongside short-term (typically five year) plans with operational purpose, countries have also expressed visions of their development pathways over longer time horizons, via, for example, Voluntary National Reviews submitted in the context of the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development."

Likewise, Nepal’s Fifteenth Plan (five-year) recognises the need for climate mitigation and adaptation and corresponding access to international finance and technologies. The plan suggests mobilisation of foreign aid in the climate change domain in line with Nepal’s priorities and its inclusion in the country’s climate-friendly development programs as the key opportunities in this regard (Nepal 2020)."

China’s 14th Five Year Plan not only seeks to promote high quality development in all aspects and focus on strengthening the economy in the global industrial chain, but also includes a vision of an ‘ecological civilisation’, which had been developed (CPC-CC 2015) and analysed earlier (He 2016; Xiao and Zhao 2017). It seeks to enhance China’s climate pledge to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 through more vigorous policies and measures. Development plans tie in multiple development priorities that evolve and broaden over time as societies develop, as exemplified inter alia by the history of development plans in India (Box 4.4)."
wg3_ch04_box-4.4_p1,Development Pathways Shape Emissions and Capacities to Mitigate ,"India’s initial national development plans focused on improving the living standards of its people, increasing national income and food self-sufficiency. Accordingly, there was a thrust towards enhancing productivity of the agricultural and industrial sectors. While the main focus was on maintaining high economic growth and industrial productivity, poverty eradication, employment and inclusive growth remained important priorities. The National Action Plan on Climate Change with eight National Missions focusing on mitigation as well as adaptation was launched in 2008 integrating climate change considerations in planning and decision-making (MoEF 2008). The 12th Five-Year Plan (2012–2017) also brought in a focus on sustainability and mentioned the need for faster, sustainable and inclusive growth. The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) was set up in 2017 replacing the erstwhile Planning Commission, with a renewed focus towards bringing innovation, technology, enterprise and efficient management together at the core of policy formulation and implementation. However, while India has moved away from its Five-Year Plans, decision-making is more dynamic, with a number of sector-specific initiatives and targets focused on integrating sustainability dimensions through a series of policies and measures supporting resource efficiency, improved energy access, infrastructure development, low-carbon options and building resilient communities, among other objectives (MoEFCC 2018, 2021). India’s overall development pathway currently has a strong focus on achieving robust and inclusive growth to ensure balanced development across all regions and states and across sectors. There is a thrust on embracing new technologies while fostering innovation and upskilling, modernisation of agriculture, improving regional and interpersonal equity, bridging the gap between public and private sector performance, by focusing on efficient delivery of public services, rooting out corruption and black economy, formalising the economy and expanding the tax base, improving the ease of doing business, nursing the stressed commercial banking sector back to a healthy state, and stopping leakages through direct benefit transfers, among other measures (GoI 2015, 2018; MoEFCC 2021)."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Analysis in the mitigation literature often frames mitigation policy as having development co-benefits, the main objective being climate stabilisation. This misses the point that development drives emissions, and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and policies that determine mitigation pathways (Munasinghe 2007). A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; Winkler 2017b), through multiple channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of development, degree of inequality, and population growth."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Economic structure: Chapter 2 notes that overall, affluence (GDP per capita), economic growth and population growth have remained the main upward drivers of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion in the past decade, with energy efficiency the main countervailing force (Lin and Liu 2015; Wang and Feng 2017) (Section 2.4). A major component of the development pathway of a country is precisely the nature of the economic activities on which the country relies (e.g., agriculture and mining, heavy industry, services, high-tech products, etc.) as well as the way it articulates its economy with the rest of the World (e.g., export-led growth vs import substitution strategies). Hence, the development pathway ultimately drives the underlying structure of the economy, and to a large degree the relationship between activity and GHG emissions."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"At country level, however, the picture is more nuanced. Both India and China show signs of relative decoupling between GDP and emissions because of structural change (Chen et al. 2018a). Sumabat et al. (2016) indicate that economic growth had a negative impact on CO2 emissions in Philippines. Baek and Gweisah (2013) find that CO2 emissions tend to drop monotonously as incomes increased. Lantz and Feng (2006) also indicate that per capita GDP is not related to CO2 emissions in Canada. Other studies point to an emerging consensus that the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic indicators depends on the level of development of countries (Nguyen and Kakinaka 2019; Sharma 2011). While some literature indicates that absolute decoupling of economic growth and GHG emissions has occurred in some countries (Le Quéré et al. 2019), a larger systematic review found limited evidence of this (Haberl et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Looking ahead, choices about the nature of economic activities are expected to have significant implications for emissions. For example, a development pathway that focuses on enhancing economic growth based on manufacturing is likely to lead to very different challenges for mitigation compared to one that focuses on services-led growth. (Quéré et al. 2018) find that choices about whether or not to export offshore oil in Brazil will have significant implications for the country’s GHG emissions. Similarly, in China, transforming industrial structure towards tertiary sectors (Kwok et al. 2018) and restructuring exports towards higher value-added products (Wu et al. 2019) are expected to have significant implications for GHG emissions."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Spatial patterns of development: Chapter 2 notes that rapid urbanisation in developing and transition countries leads to increased CO2 emissions, the substantial migration of rural populations to urban areas in these countries being the main factor leading to increased levels of income and expenditure of new urban dwellers which in turn leads to increased personal carbon footprints and overall emissions (Section 2.4). Urbanisation, and more broadly spatial patterns of development, are in turned driven to a large part by development choices, such as, inter alia, spatial provision of infrastructure and services, choices regarding the agriculture and forestry sector, land-use policies, support to regional/local development, among others (World Bank 2009). For example, Dorin (2017) points out that if agriculture sectors in Africa and India follow the same development path that developed countries have followed in the past, namely increased labour productivity through enlargement and robotisation of farms, then unprecedented emigrations of rural workers towards cities or foreign countries will ensue, with large-scale social, economic and environmental consequences. Looking ahead, a development pathway that encourages concentrated influx of people to large urban centres will lead to very different energy and infrastructure consumption patterns than a pathway that prioritises the development of smaller, self-contained towns and cities."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Degree of inequality: Chapter 2 notes that while eradicating extreme poverty and providing universal access to modern energy services to poor populations across the globe has negligible implications for emissions growth, existing studies on the role of poverty and inequality as drivers of GHG emissions provide limited evidence that under certain contexts greater inequality can lead to a deterioration in environmental quality and may be associated with higher GHG emissions (Section 2.4). In fact, factors affecting household consumption-based emissions include household size, age, education attainment, employment status, urban vs rural location and housing stock (Druckman and Jackson 2015). There is evidence to indicate that at the household level, the increase in emissions from additional consumption of the lower income households could be larger than the reduction in emissions from the drop in consumption from the high income households (Sager 2019). Accordingly, as countries seek to fulfil the objective of reducing inequality, there are possibilities of higher increase in emissions (Sager 2019)."

However, the use of narrow approaches or simple methods of studying the relationships of income inequality and emissions by looking at correlations, may miss important linkages. For example, the influence of inequality on social values such as status and civic mindedness and non-political interests that shape environmental policy can influence overall consumption and its environmental impacts (Berthe and Elie 2015).

However, the environmental implications of the transition need to be carefully examined with regard to the socio-economic implications in light of the potential of other alternatives like green hydrogen, nuclear or carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). Similarly, South Africa National Development Plan (2011) also integrates transition to low-carbon as part of the country development objectives (Box 4.5)."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Analysis in the mitigation literature often frames mitigation policy as having development co-benefits, the main objective being climate stabilisation. This misses the point that development drives emissions, and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and policies that determine mitigation pathways (Munasinghe 2007). A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; Winkler 2017b), through multiple channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of development, degree of inequality, and population growth."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Economic structure: Chapter 2 notes that overall, affluence (GDP per capita), economic growth and population growth have remained the main upward drivers of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion in the past decade, with energy efficiency the main countervailing force (Lin and Liu 2015; Wang and Feng 2017) (Section 2.4). A major component of the development pathway of a country is precisely the nature of the economic activities on which the country relies (e.g., agriculture and mining, heavy industry, services, high-tech products, etc.) as well as the way it articulates its economy with the rest of the World (e.g., export-led growth vs import substitution strategies). Hence, the development pathway ultimately drives the underlying structure of the economy, and to a large degree the relationship between activity and GHG emissions."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"At country level, however, the picture is more nuanced. Both India and China show signs of relative decoupling between GDP and emissions because of structural change (Chen et al. 2018a). Sumabat et al. (2016) indicate that economic growth had a negative impact on CO2 emissions in Philippines. Baek and Gweisah (2013) find that CO2 emissions tend to drop monotonously as incomes increased. Lantz and Feng (2006) also indicate that per capita GDP is not related to CO2 emissions in Canada. Other studies point to an emerging consensus that the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic indicators depends on the level of development of countries (Nguyen and Kakinaka 2019; Sharma 2011). While some literature indicates that absolute decoupling of economic growth and GHG emissions has occurred in some countries (Le Quéré et al. 2019), a larger systematic review found limited evidence of this (Haberl et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Looking ahead, choices about the nature of economic activities are expected to have significant implications for emissions. For example, a development pathway that focuses on enhancing economic growth based on manufacturing is likely to lead to very different challenges for mitigation compared to one that focuses on services-led growth. (Quéré et al. 2018) find that choices about whether or not to export offshore oil in Brazil will have significant implications for the country’s GHG emissions. Similarly, in China, transforming industrial structure towards tertiary sectors (Kwok et al. 2018) and restructuring exports towards higher value-added products (Wu et al. 2019) are expected to have significant implications for GHG emissions."
wg3_ch04_4.3.2.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Spatial patterns of development: Chapter 2 notes that rapid urbanisation in developing and transition countries leads to increased CO2 emissions, the substantial migration of rural populations to urban areas in these countries being the main factor leading to increased levels of income and expenditure of new urban dwellers which in turn leads to increased personal carbon footprints and overall emissions (Section 2.4). Urbanisation, and more broadly spatial patterns of development, are in turned driven to a large part by development choices, such as, inter alia, spatial provision of infrastructure and services, choices regarding the agriculture and forestry sector, land-use policies, support to regional/local development, among others (World Bank 2009). For example, Dorin (2017) points out that if agriculture sectors in Africa and India follow the same development path that developed countries have followed in the past, namely increased labour productivity through enlargement and robotisation of farms, then unprecedented emigrations of rural workers towards cities or foreign countries will ensue, with large-scale social, economic and environmental consequences. Looking ahead, a development pathway that encourages concentrated influx of people to large urban centres will lead to very different energy and infrastructure consumption patterns than a pathway that prioritises the development of smaller, self-contained towns and cities."

The chapter refers explicitly to the need for a just transition, protecting the poor from impacts and any transitional costs from emissions-intensive to low-carbon. The plan proposes several mitigation measures, including a carbon budgeting approach, reference to Treasury’s carbon tax, use of various low-carbon options while maintaining energy security, and the integrated resource plan for electricity.

Shifting development pathways necessitates planning in a holistic manner, rather than thinking about discrete and isolated activities and actions to undertake mitigation. Further, the necessary transformational changes can be positive if they are rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and society in which they take place (Dubash 2012; Jones et al. 2013), but they can also lead to carbon colonialism if the transformations are imposed by Northern donors or perceived as such."

The implications for employment, education, mobility, housing and many other development aspects must be integrated and new ways of looking at development pathways which are low carbon must be considered (Bataille et al. 2016b; Waisman et al. 2019). For instance, job creation and education are important elements that could play a key role in reducing inequality and poverty in countries like South Africa and India (Winkler et al. 2015; Rao and Min 2018) while these also open up broader opportunities for mitigation."

They are generally conceived and implemented in the pursuit of overall societal development objectives, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. However, they can have major influence on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as necessary tools if mitigation options are to be significantly broadened and accelerated (medium evidence, medium agreement). The example of the UK shows how accelerated mitigation through dietary changes require a wide set of efforts to shift underlying drivers of behaviour. In this case, multiple forces have interacted to lead to reduced meat consumption, including health attitudes, animal welfare concerns, and an increasing focus on climate and other environmental impacts of livestock production, along with corporate investment in market opportunities, and technological developments in meat alternatives (Box 5.5)."

A network of agricultural extension services accelerated the popularization and uptake of modern methods. Infrastructure investments in irrigation and drainage made production more viable, and investment in roadways and rail for transport supported market formation.

Each society whether in the Global North or the Global South follows its own pattern of development (Figure 1.6).

wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p6,NO_TITLE,"Development pathways drive GHG emissions for a large part (Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). For example, different social choices and policy packages with regard to land use and associated rents will result in human settlements with different spatial patterns, different types of housing markets and cultures, and different degrees of inclusiveness, and thus different demand for transport services and associated GHG emissions (Sections 8.3.1 and 10.2.1)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p7,NO_TITLE,"There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways is unlikely to achieve rapid and deep emission reductions (robust evidence, medium agreement). For example, investments in long-lived infrastructure, including energy supply systems, could lock-in high emissions pathways and risk making deep decarbonisation and sustainable policies more difficult and expensive."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p8,NO_TITLE,"Development pathways also determine the set of tools available to mitigate climate change (Figure 4.7). For example, the capacity of households to move closer to their workplace, in response to, for example, a price signal on carbon and thus on gasoline, depends on rents, which themselves depend on the spatial patterns of development of human settlements (Section 8.3.1). Said differently, mitigation costs depend on past development choices. Similarly, development pathways determine the enablers and levers available for adaptation (AR6 WGII, Chapter 18) and for achieving other SDGs."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p9,NO_TITLE,"In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy instruments (e.g., carbon tax, emission quotas, technological norms, etc.) may not be able to limit emissions to a degree sufficient for deep decarbonisation or only at very high economic and social costs."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p10,NO_TITLE,"Policies to shift development pathways, on the contrary, make mitigation policies more effective. For example, policies that prioritise non-car transit, or limit rents close to work places would make it easier for households to relocate in response to a price signal on transport, and thus makes the same degree of mitigation achievable at lower economic and social cost."

For example, transitions from coal-based power to lower-emissions electricity generation technologies and from internal combustion engine to lower-carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local air pollution (Box 6.2 and Section 10.4.1). Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also delivers significant health benefits (Sections 9.8.1 and 9.8.2)."

However, even with good policy design, decisions about mitigation actions, and the timing and scale thereof, may entail trade-offs with the achievement of other national development objectives in the near-, mid- and long term. In the near term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution, but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green spaces within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and push low income residents outside the city (Section 8.2.2). In the mid- and long-term, large-scale deployment of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation (Sections 3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2 and 12.5.3). Conflicts between mitigation and other development objectives can act as an impediment to climate action (Section 13.8). Climate change is the result of decades of unsustainable energy production, land-use, production and consumption patterns, as well as governance arrangements and political economic institutions that lock in resource-intensive development patterns (robust evidence,  high agreement). Reframing development objectives and shifting development pathways towards sustainability can help transform these patterns and practices, allowing space for transitions transforming unsustainable systems (medium evidence,  high agreement) (Chapter 17, Executive Summary)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p17,NO_TITLE,"Prioritising is one way to manage trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards sustainability as they expand the range of tools available to simultaneously achieve multiple development objectives, including mitigation. In the city example of Section 2a, a carbon tax alone would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high emissions transport modes poorer or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing and provision of safe low-carbon mobility could both facilitate equitable access to housing (a major development objective in many countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p18,NO_TITLE,"Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), driven by targeted policies, investment and enabling socio-cultural and behavioural change, would reduce pressure on supply side mitigation need, hence limiting pressure on water and food and the achievement of associated SDGs. Some studies assume Western European lifestyle as a reference for the Global North and an improvement in the living standard for the Global South to reduce energy demand and emissions (Grubler et al. 2018), while others explore a transformative change in the Global North to achieve a decent living standard for all (Bertram et al. 2018; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020) (Section 3.7.8). For example, in the UK, interaction between multiple behavioural, socio-cultural, and corporate drivers including NGO campaigns, social movements and product innovations resulted in an observed decline in meat consumption (Sections 5.4 and 5.6.4)."

wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p20,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development pathways towards sustainability implies making transformative changes that disrupt existing developmental trends. Such choices would not be marginal (Stern 2009), but include technology adoption, infrastructure availability and use, and socio-behavioural factors (Chapter 5)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p21,NO_TITLE,"These include creating new infrastructure, sustainable supply chains, institutional capacities for evidence-based and integrated decision-making, financial alignment towards low-carbon socially responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour and norms to support shifts away from fossil-fuel consumption (Green and Denniss 2018). Adopting multi-level governance modes, tackling corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key for aligning and supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p22,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development pathways entails fundamental changes in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems. It also requires changes in behaviour and social practices. Overcoming inertia and locked-in practices may face considerable opposition (Geels et al. 2017) (Section 5.4.5). The durability of carbon intensive transport modes and electricity generating infrastructures increase the risk of lock-in to high emissions pathways, as these comprise not just consumer practices, but sunk costs in infrastructure, supporting institutions and rules (Seto et al. 2016; Mattioli et al. 2020). Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities, as well as the availability of financing to enable such a transition (Section 15.3)."

wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p25,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development paths is complex. If history is any guide, practices that can easily supplant existing systems and are clearly profitable move fastest (Griliches 1957). Changes that involve ‘dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components’ take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning (Conley and Udry 2010), even when they promise large gains (Pezzoni et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p26,NO_TITLE,"Yet despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector and social stakeholders. For example, fundamentally different responses to the first oil shock shifted then-comparable economies on to different energy sector development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (Sathaye et al. 2009). More recent examples have shown evidence of voluntary transitions for example, advanced lighting in Sweden, improved cook-stoves in China, liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia or ethanol vehicles in Brazil (Sovacool 2016)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p27,NO_TITLE,"There is no one-size-fits-all recipe for shifting development pathways. However, the following insights can be drawn from past experience and scenarios of possible future development pathways (Section 4.4.1). For example, policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and affordable reduce transport costs for low- and middle-income households, and also reduce transport emissions (Section 4.4.1.9). Shifts in development pathways result from both sustained political interventions and bottom-up changes in public opinion. No single sector or policy action is enough to achieve this. Coordinated policy mixes would need to coordinate multiple actors – in other words, individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors – to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability (Pettifor 2020). One example was the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Subsidy (‘Zero Kero’) Program in Indonesia which harnessed creative policy design to shift to cleaner energy by overcoming existing private interests. The objective of decreasing fiscal expenditures on domestic kerosene subsidies by replacing it with LPG was achieved by harnessing distribution networks of existing providers supported by government subsidised provision of equipment and subsidised pricing (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 13)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p28,NO_TITLE,"Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements or informal lifestyle changes underpins system change (Sections 5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5.3 and 13.5)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p29,NO_TITLE,"Sectoral transitions that aspire to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives, and deploy a diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Figure 13.6). Context specific governance conditions can significantly enable or disable sectoral transitions, and play a determinative role in whether a sectoral transition leads to a shift in development pathway. For example, if implemented policies to tackle fuel poverty target the most socially vulnerable households, this can help address barriers poor households face in undertaking building retrofits. In the EU-28, it has been shown that accelerated energy efficiency policies coupled with strong social policies targeting the most vulnerable households, can help reduce the energy demand in residential sector, and deliver additional co-benefits of avoided premature deaths and reduced health impacts (Section 9.8.2)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p30,NO_TITLE,"Literature suggests that through equitable resource distribution, high levels of human development can be provided at moderate energy and carbon levels by changing consumption patterns and redirecting systems in the direction of more sustainable resource use, suggesting that a special effort can be made in the near term for those on higher incomes who account for a disproportionate fraction of global emissions (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Hickel et al. 2021) (Section 5.2.2 and Figure 5.14)."

wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p35,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability is a shared aspiration. Yet since countries differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent needs in terms of facilitating the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities (Sections 4.3.2 and 17.4). The appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p36,NO_TITLE,"In some developed countries and communities, affluence leads to high levels of consumption and emissions across sectors (Mazur and Rosa 1974; Wiedmann et al. 2020). For some countries, reducing consumption can reduce emissions without compromising on wellbeing. However, some developing countries still face the challenge of escaping ‘middle-income traps’ (Agénor and Canuto 2015), as labour-saving technological change and globalisation have limited options to develop via the manufacturing sector (Altenburg and Rodrik 2017). In least developed countries, infrastructure, industry, and public services are still being established, posing both a challenge to financial support to deploy technologies, and large opportunities to support accelerating low-to-zero carbon options – especially in terms of efficient and sufficient provision (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). Availability of capital, or lack thereof, is a critical discriminant across countries and requires international cooperation (Section 15.2.2)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p37,NO_TITLE,"Shifting development pathways towards sustainability needs to be supported by global partnerships to strengthen suitable capacity, technological innovation (Section 16.6), and financial flows (Sections 14.4.1, 15.2.4). The international community can play a particularly key role by helping ensure the necessary broad participation in climate-mitigation efforts, including by countries at different development levels, through sustained support for policies and partnerships that support shifting development pathways towards sustainability while promoting equity and being mindful of different transition capacities (Sections 4.3.2, 16.5, 16.6, 14.4 and 17.4)."
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p38,NO_TITLE,"In sum, development pathways unfold over time in response to complex dynamics among various drivers and diverse actors with varying interests and motivations ( high agreement , robust evidence). The way countries develop determines the nature and degree of the obstacles to accelerating mitigation and achieving other sustainable development objectives (medium-robust evidence, medium agreement). Meeting ambitious mitigation and development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change (robust evidence, medium agreement). Shifting development pathways thus involves designing and implementing policies where possible to intentionally enhance enabling conditions and reduce obstacles to desired outcomes (medium evidence, medium agreement). "
wg3_ch04_cross-chapter-box-5_p39,NO_TITLE,"Section 4.4 elaborates mechanisms through which societies can develop and implement policies to substantially shift development pathways toward securing shared societal objectives. Such policies entail overcoming obstacles (Section 4.2.7) by means of favourable enabling conditions: governance and institutions, behaviour, innovation, policy and finance. These enabling conditions are amenable to intentional change – to greater or lesser degrees and over longer or shorter time scales – based on a range of possible measures and processes (Section 4.4)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"What have we learned so far? As highlighted above, despite 30 years of UNFCCC and growing contributions by non-state actors, the emissions gap keeps growing (Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). Mitigation conceived as incremental change is not enough. Meeting ambitious mitigation goals entails rapid, non-marginal changes in production and consumption patterns (Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.5). Taking another approach, we have seen in Section 4.3 that shifting development pathways broadens the scope for mitigation (Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2) and offers more opportunities than mitigation alone to combine mitigation with the realisation of other SDGs (Section 4.3.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"A practical way forward is to combine shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation (medium evidence,  high agreement). This means introducing multi-objective policy packages and sequences with climate and development components that both target mitigation directly and create the conditions for shifts in development pathways that will help accelerate further mitigation down the line, and meet other development objectives. Since development pathways result from myriad decisions from multiple actors (Section 4.3.1), coordination across countries and with non-state actors is essential."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The literature does not provide a handbook on how to accomplish the above. However, analysis of past experience as well as understanding of how societies function yield insights that the present section aims at presenting. Human history has seen multiple transformation of economies due to path-breaking innovations (Michaelowa et al. 2018), like the transformation of the energy system from traditional biomass to fossil fuels or from steam to electricity (Fouquet 2010, 2016a; Sovacool 2016). Fouquet (2016b) and Smil (2016) argue that even the most rapid global transformations have taken several decades. Enabling transformational change implies to create now the conditions that lead to that transformation (Díaz et al. 2019). The starting point is that there is no single factor determining such a transformation. Rather a range of enabling conditions can combine in a co-evolutionary process. Amongst the conditions that have been cited in the literature are higher levels of innovation, multilevel governance, transformative policy regimes or profound behavioural transformation (Rockström et al. 2017; IPCC 2018a; Geels et al. 2018; Kriegler et al. 2018). It might be possible to put in place some of the above conditions rapidly, while others may take longer, thereby requiring an early start."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The present chapter uses the set of enabling conditions identified in the IPCC SR1.5 report, namely policy, governance and institutional capacity, finance, behaviour and lifestyles and innovation and technology (de Coninck et al. 2018). As Figure 4.8 illustrates, public policies are required to foster both accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways. They are also vital to guide and provide the other enabling conditions (compare Table 4.12). Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity facilitate the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways, with the potential to achieve multiple mitigation and development objectives. Finance is required both to accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. Chapter 15 argues that near term actions to shift the financial system over the next decade (2021–2030) are critically important and feasible, and that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities to scale up financing from billions to trillions (Mawdsley 2018) (Section 15.6.7). As discussed in Section 4.2.5, accelerated mitigation pathways encompass both rapid deployment of new technologies such as CCS or electric vehicles, as well as changes in consumption patterns: rapid deployment of mitigation technology and behaviour change are thus two enabling conditions to accelerated mitigation. Dynamics of deployment of technologies are relatively well known, pointing to specific, short-term action to accelerate innovation and deployment (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16), whereas dynamics of collective behaviour change is less well understood. Arguably, the latter also facilitates shifting development pathways."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Individual enabling conditions are discussed at length in Chapter 5 (behaviour change), 13 (policies, governance and institutional capacity), 15 (finance) and 16 (innovation). The purpose of the discussion below is to draw operational implications from these chapters for action, taking into account the focus of the present Chapter on action at the national level in the near- and mid-term, and its special emphasis on shifting development pathways in addition to accelerated mitigation."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"The rest of the Section is organised as follows. Policy packages that combine climate and development policies are first discussed (Section 4.4.1.2). The next sections are dedicated to the conditions that facilitate shifts in development pathways and accelerated mitigation: governance and institutions (Section 4.4.1.3), financial resources (Section 4.4.1.4), behaviour change (Section 4.4.1.5) and innovation (Section 4.4.1.6). Four examples of how climate and development policies can be combined to shift pathways and accelerate mitigation are then presented (Sections 4.4.1.7, 4.4.1.8, 4.4.1.9 and 4.4.1.10). Section 4.4.2 focuses specifically on how shifts in development pathways can deliver both mitigation and adaptation. Finally, Section 4.4.3 discusses risks and uncertainties associated with combining shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Although many transformations in the past have been driven by the emergence and diffusion of an innovative technology, policy intervention was frequent, especially in the more rapid ones (Michaelowa et al. 2018; Grubb et al. 2021). Likewise, it is not expected that spontaneous behaviour change or market evolution alone yield the type of transformations outlined in the accelerated mitigation pathways described in Section 4.2.5, or in the shifts in development pathways described in Section 4.3.3. On the contrary, stringent temperature targets imply bold policies in the short term (Rockström et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018) to enforce effective existing policy instruments and regulations, as well as to reform or remove harmful existing policies and subsidies (Díaz et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Policy integration, addressing multiple objectives, is an essential component of shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation (robust evidence,  high agreement). A shift in development pathways that fosters accelerated mitigation may best be achieved through integrated actions that comprise policies in support of the broader SDG agenda, based on country-specific priorities (Sections 4.3.2, 13.8 and 13.9). These may include for example, fiscal policies, or integrating industrial (Nilsson et al. 2021) and energy policies (Fragkos et al. 2021) with climate policies. Similarly, sectoral transitions that aspire to shifting development pathways towards sustainability often have multiple objectives, and deploy a diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Cross-Chapter Box 5)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Because low-carbon transitions are political processes, analyses are needed of  policy as well as for policy (Section 13.6). Political scientists have developed a number of theoretical models that both explain policy-making processes and provide useful insights for influencing those processes. Case studies of successes and failures in sustainable development and mitigation offer equally important insights. Both theoretical and empirical analysis reinforce the argument that single policy instruments are not sufficient (robust evidence,  high agreement). Policymakers might rather mobilise a range of policies, such as financial instruments (taxes, subsidies, grants, loans), regulatory instruments (standards, laws, performance targets) and processual instruments (demonstration projects, network management, public debates, consultations, foresight exercises, roadmaps) (Voß et al. 2007). Policies can be designed to focus on limiting or phasing out high-carbon technology. The appropriate mix is likely to vary between countries and domains, depending on political cultures and stakeholder configurations (Rogge and Reichardt 2016), but is likely to include a combination of: (i) standards, nudges and information to encourage low-carbon technology adoption and behavioural change; (ii) economic incentives to reward low-carbon investments; (iii) supply-side policy instruments including for fossil fuel production (to complement demand-side climate policies) and (iv) innovation support and strategic investment to encourage systemic change (Grubb 2014). These approaches can be mutually reinforcing. For example, carbon pricing can incentivise low-carbon innovation, while targeted support for emerging niche technologies can make them more competitive encourage their diffusion and ultimately facilitate a higher level of carbon pricing. Similarly, the success of feed-in tariffs in Germany only worked as well as it did because it formed part of a broader policy mix including ‘supply-push’ mechanisms such as subsidies for research and ‘systemic measures’ such as collaborative research projects and systems of knowledge exchange (Rogge et al. 2015)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Governance for climate mitigation and shifting development pathways is enhanced when tailored to national and local contexts. Improved institutions and governance enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation gaps (medium evidence,  high agreement). Improving institutions involve a broad range of stakeholders and multiple regional and temporal scales. It necessitates a credible and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and losers and adopting compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive and just transition (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019), managing the risk of inequitable or non-representative power dynamics and avoiding regulatory capture by special interests (Helsinki Design Lab 2011; Boulle et al. 2015; Kahane 2012)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). For example, shift away from fossil fuel-based energy economy could significantly disrupt the status quo, leading to a stranding of financial and capital assets and shifting of political-economic power. Ensuring the decision-making process is not unduly influenced by actors with much to lose is key to managing a transformation. Effective governance, as noted in Chapter 13, requires establishing strategic direction, coordination of policy responses, and mediation among divergent interests. Among varieties of climate governance, which institutions emerge is path-dependent, based on the interplay of national political institutions, international drivers, and bureaucratic structures (Dubash 2021). Focused national climate institutions to address these challenges are more likely to emerge, persist and be effective when they are consistent with a framing of climate change that has broad national political support (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Sections 4.5, 13.2 and 13.5)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Innovative governance approaches can help meet these challenges (Clark et al. 2018; Díaz et al. 2019). Enabling multilevel governance– i.e., better alignment across governance scales – and coordination of international organisations and national governments can help accelerate a transition to sustainable development and deep decarbonisation (Tait and Euston-Brown 2017; Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017; Ringel 2017; Revi 2017; Cheshmehzangi 2016; IPCC 2018a). Participatory and inclusive governance– partnerships between state and non-state actors, and concerted effort across different stakeholders are crucial in supporting acceleration (Burch et al. 2014; Hering et al. 2014; Roberts 2016; Figueres et al. 2017; Clark et al. 2018; Leal Filho et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018). So do partnerships through transnational climate governance initiatives, which coordinate nation states and non-state actors on an international scale (Hsu et al. 2018). Although they are unlikely to close the gap of the insufficient mitigation effort of national governments (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017) (Section 4.2.3), they help building confidence in governments concerning climate policy and push for more ambitious national goals (UNEP 2018b)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Meeting these challenges also requires enhanced institutional capacity and enhanced institutional mechanisms to strengthen the coordination between multiple actors, improve complementarities and synergies between multiple objectives (Rasul 2016; Ringel 2017; Liu et al. 2018) and pursue climate action and other development objectives in an integrated and coherent way (Von Stechow et al. 2016; McCollum et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018b; Roy et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019), particularly in developing countries (Adenle et al. 2017; Rosenbloom 2017). Institutional capacities to be strengthened include vertical collaboration and interaction within nation states and horizontal collaboration (e.g., transnational city networks) for the development and implementation of plans, regulations and policies. More specifically capacities include: capacity for knowledge harnessing and integration (from multiple perspectives); for integrated policy design and implementation (Scott 2017); for long-term planning (Lecocq et al. 2021) for monitoring and review process; for coordinating multi-actor processes to create synergies and avoid trade-offs. As a result, institutions that enable and improve human capacities and capabilities are a major driver of transformation. To this extent, promoting education, health care and social safety, also are instrumental to undertake climate change mitigation and cope with environmental problems (Winkler et al. 2007; Sachs et al. 2019). Given that strengthening institutions may be a long-term endeavour, it needs attention in the near term."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Accelerated mitigation and shifting development pathways necessitate both redirecting existing financial flows from high- to low-emissions technologies and systems and providing additional resources (robust evidence,  high agreement). An example is changes in investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with pressures to disinvest in the former while increasing levels of ‘green finance’ (Sections 6.7.4 and 15.5). While some lower-carbon technologies have become competitive (Sections 1.4.3 and 2.5), support remains needed for the low-emissions options have higher costs per unit of service provided than high-emission ones. Lack of financial resources is identified as a major barrier to the implementation of accelerated mitigation and of shifts in development pathways. Overcoming this obstacle has two major components. One relates to private capital. The other to public finance."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is substantial amount of research on the redirection of private financial flows towards low-carbon investment and the role of financial regulators and central banks, as detailed in Chapter 15. Financial systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition (Fankhauser et al. 2016; Naidoo 2020). Policy frameworks can redirect financial resources towards low-emission assets and services (UNEP 2015), mainstreaming climate finance within financial and banking system regulation, and reducing transaction costs for bankable mitigation technology projects (Mundaca et al. 2013; Brunner and Enting 2014; Yeo 2019). Shifts in the financial system to finance climate mitigation and other SDGs can be achieved by aligning incentives and investments with multiple objectives (UNEP Inquiry 2016)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Different approaches have been explored to improve such alignment (Section 15.6), from national credit policies to directly green mainstream financial regulations (e.g., through modifications in the Basel rules for banks). For all approaches, an essential precondition is to assess and monitor the contribution of financial flows to climate and sustainability goals, with better metrics that clearly link with financial activity (Chenet et al. 2019). Enabling the alignment of investment decision-making with achieving climate and broader sustainability goals includes acknowledgment and disclosure of climate-change related risk and of risks associated with mitigation in financial portfolios. Current disclosures remain far from the scale the markets need to channel investment to sustainable and resilient solutions (UNEP - Finance Initiative 2020; Clark et al. 2018; Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 2019; IPCC 2018b). Disclosure, however, is not enough (Ameli et al. 2020). In addition, climate targets can be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs for financial institutions, both at national and international level. Financing needs are usable for financial institutions, to inform portfolio allocation decisions and financing priorities (Chenet et al. 2019). At the international level, for example, technology roadmaps for key sectors can be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs, as shown by existing experiences in energy and industrial sectors (IEA 2015; IEA and WBSCD 2018; Chenet et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The transition from traditional public climate finance interventions to the market-based support of climate mitigation (Bodnar et al. 2018) demands innovative forms of financial cooperation and innovative financing mechanisms to help de-risk low-emission investments and support new business models. These financial innovations may involve sub-national actors like cities and regional governments in raising finance to achieve their commitments (Cartwright 2015; CCFLA 2017). Moreover, public-private partnerships have proved to be an important vehicle for financing investments to meet the SDGs, including economic instruments for financing conservation (Sovacool 2013; Díaz et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Overall, early action is needed to overcome barriers and to adjust the existing incentive system to align national development strategies with climate and sustainable development goals in the medium-term. Steckel et al. (2017) conclude that climate finance could become a central pillar of sustainable development by reconciling the global goal of cost-efficient mitigation with national policy priorities. Without a more rapid, scaled redeployment of financing, in development trajectories that hinder the realisation of the global goals will be locked in (Zadek and Robins 2016). Investment might be designed to avoid trading off the Paris goals against other SDGs, as well as those that simultaneously reduce poverty, inequality, and emissions (Fuso Nerini et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"At the national level, it is also essential to create public fiscal space for actions promoting the SDG agenda and thereby broadening the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement). To do so, pricing carbon – either through tax payments based on the level of emissions or cap-and-trade systems that limit total allowable emissions – is an efficient means of discouraging carbon emissions throughout an economy (both in consumption and production) while simultaneously encouraging a switch to non-carbon energy sources and generating revenues for prioritised actions (Section 13.6.3). Regarding to levels, the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices concluded that ‘carbon-price level consistent with achieving the Paris temperature target is at least USD40–80 tCO2–1 by 2020 and USD50–100 tCO2–1 by 2030, provided a supportive policy environment is in place’ (CPLC 2017; Wall Street Journal 2019). National level models yield median carbon values of carbon values of USD733 tCO2–1 in 2050 along accelerated mitigation pathways (Section 4.2.6), while global models find a median value of USD578 tCO2–1 for pathways that reach net zero CO2 between 2045 and 2055 [interquartile range USD405–708] (Section 3.6.1)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Carbon pricing, however, is designed to reduce its fiscal base. Fiscal space may therefore also need to stem from other sources, although fiscal reforms are complex endeavours (Section 4.4.1.8). For countries at lower income levels, foreign aid can make an important contribution to the same agenda (Kharas and McArthur 2019). It may also be noted that, according to estimates at the global level, military spending amounted to USD1.748 trillion in 2012 (the last year with data), a figure that corresponded to 2.3% of GDP, 55% of government spending in education, and was 13 times the level of net ODA (World Bank 2020; SIPRI 2020). Given this, moderate reductions in military spending (which may involve conflict resolution and cross-country agreements on arms limitations) could free up considerable resources for the SDG agenda, both in the countries that reduce spending and in the form of ODA. The resolution of conflicts within and between countries before they become violent would also reduce the need for public and private spending repairing human and physical damage. The fact that civil wars are common in the countries that face the severest SDG challenges underscores the importance of this issue (Collier 2007, pp.17–37)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Changes in behaviour and lifestyles are important to accelerated mitigation. Most global mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower assume substantial behavioural and societal change and low-carbon lifestyles (de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 2018a; Luderer et al. 2018a) (see also Section 3.3.1 in this report; and Table 4.9 and Figure 4.3 in IPCC SR1.5).

wg3_ch04_4.4.1.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Individual motivation and capacity are impacted by different factors that go beyond traditional social, demographic and economic predictors. However, it is unclear to what extent behavioural factors (i.e., cognitive, motivational and contextual aspects) are taken into account in policy design (Dubois et al. 2019; Mundaca et al. 2019). In fact, while economic policies play a significant role in influencing people’s decisions and behaviour, many drivers of human behaviour and values work largely outside the market system (Winkler et al. 2015; Díaz et al. 2019) as actors in society, particularly individuals, do not respond in an economically ‘rational’ manner based on perfect-information cost-benefit analyses (Runge 1984; Shiller 2019). Rather, compelling narratives can drive individuals to adopt new norms and policies. And norms can be more quickly and more robustly shifted by proposing and framing policies designed with awareness of how framings interact with individual cognitive tendencies (van der Linden et al. 2015). Transformative policies are thus much more likely to be successfully adopted and lead to long-term behavioural change if designed in accordance with principles of cognitive psychology (van der Linden et al. 2015), and with the deep understanding of decision-making offered by behavioural science (UNEP 2017b). Similarly, given that present bias – being motivated by costs and benefits that take effect immediately than those delivered later – significantly shapes behaviour, schemes that bring forward distant costs into the present or that upfront incentives have proved to be more effective (Zauberman et al. 2009; van den Broek et al. 2017; Safarzyńska 2018). Overall, transformational strategies that align mitigation with subjective life satisfaction, and build societal support by positive discourses about economic, social, and cultural benefits of low-carbon innovations, promises far more success than targeting mitigation alone (WBGU 2011; Asensio and Delmas 2016; Geels et al. 2017)."

Social influences, particularly from peers, affect people’s engagement in climate action (Schelly 2014). Role models appear to have a solid basis in people’s everyday preferences (WBGU 2011). Social norms can reinforce individuals’ underlying motivations and be effective in encouraging sustainable consumption patterns, as many examples offered by behavioural science illustrate. Social networks also influence and spread behaviours (Service et al. 2014; Clayton et al. 2015; Farrow et al. 2017; Shah et al. 2019). These social influences can be harnessed by climate policy."

Other scholars have examined the role of women in redistributing power, both in the sense of energy transition and in terms of gender relations (Allen et al. 2019; Routledge et al. 2018). Mitigation and broader sustainable development policies that facilitate active participation by stakeholders can build trust, forge new social contracts, and contribute to a positive cycle building climate governance capacity (Section 5.2.3)."

Successful shifts towards public transport, for example, involve technologies (buses, trams), infrastructure (light rail, dedicated bus lanes), regulations (operational licenses, performance contracts), institutions (new organisations, responsibilities, oversight), and high-enough density, which in turn depends on such choices as housing or planning policies (Section 4.4.1.9)."

As part of its key role in technological change, R&D can make a crucial contribution to accelerated mitigation up to 2030 and beyond, among other things by focusing on closing technology gaps that stand in the way of decarbonising today’s high emitting sectors. Such sectors include shipping, trucking, aviation and heavy industries like steel, cement and chemicals. More broadly, it is increasingly clear that digital changes are becoming a key driving force in societal transformation (Tegmark 2017). Digitalisation is not only an ‘instrument’ for resolving sustainability challenges, it is also a fundamental driver of disruptive, multiscalar change (Sachs et al. 2019) that amounts to a shift in development pathway. Information and communication technologies, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, robotics, are not usually categorised as climate technologies, but have a potential impact on GHG emissions (OECD 2017b) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 16)."

The research community has called for more ‘responsible innovation’ (Pandza and Ellwood 2013), ‘open innovation’ (Rauter et al. 2019), ‘mission-oriented’ innovation (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017), ‘holistic innovation’ (Chen et al. 2018b), ‘next-generation innovation policy’ (Kuhlmann and Rip 2018) or ‘transformative innovation’ (Schot and Steinmueller 2018) so that innovation patterns and processes are commensurate to our growing sustainability challenges. There is a growing recognition that new forms of innovation can be harnessed and coupled to climate objectives (Fagerberg et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018). As such, innovation and socio-technical change can be channelled to intensify mitigation via ‘deliberate acceleration’ (Roberts et al. 2018a) and ‘coalition building’ (Hess 2018)."

For example, decarbonisation in sectors with long lived capital stock (such as heavy industry, buildings, transport infrastructure) entail technology, policy and financing innovations (Bataille 2020). Similarly, expanding the deployment of photovoltaics can draw upon policies that support specific technical innovations (e.g., to improve photovoltaics efficiency), or innovations in regulatory and market regimes (e.g., net-metering), to innovations in social organisation (e.g., community-ownership). System innovation is a core focus of the transitions literature (Grin et al. 2010; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017). Accelerating low-carbon transitions not only involves a shift of system elements but also underlying routines and rules, and hence transitions shift the directionality of innovation. They hence concern the development of a new paradigm or regime that is more focused on solving sustainability challenges that cannot be solved within the dominant regime they substitute (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"Several studies have pointed at the important possible contributions of grassroots innovators for the start-up of sustainability transitions (Seyfang and Smith 2007; Seyfang et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016). In particular, a range of studies have shown that users can play a variety of roles in promoting system innovation: shielding, nurturing (including learning, networking and visioning) and empowering the niches in relation to the dominant system and regime (Schot et al. 2016; Randelli and Rocchi 2017; Meelen et al. 2019). More fundamentally, innovation regimes can be led and guided by markets driven by monetisable profits (as much of private sector led technological innovation of patentable intellectual property), or prioritise social returns (e.g., innovation structures such as innovation prizes, public sector innovation, investments in human capital, and socially-beneficial intellectual property regimes). In both cases, public policies can play a key role by providing resources and favourable incentives (IEA 2020). Chapter 16 provides more details on ways to foster innovation."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Developing countries have experienced a period of rapid economic growth in the past two decades. Patterns of growth have differed markedly across regions, with newly emerging East Asian economies building on transition to manufacturing – as China has done in the past – while Latin American countries tend to transition directly from primary sector to services (Rodrik 2016), and African countries tend to rely on productivity improvements in the primary sectors (Diao et al. 2019). Yet many countries still face the challenge of getting out of the ‘middle-income trap’ (Agénor and Canuto 2015), as labour-saving technological change and globalisation have limited options to develop via the manufacturing sector (Altenburg and Rodrik 2017)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Looking ahead, several studies have illustrated how structural change towards sustainability could lead to reduced emissions intensity and higher mitigative capacity.

wg3_ch04_4.4.1.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Overall, Altenburg et al. (2017) argue that reallocation of capital and labour from low- to high-productivity sectors – in other words, structural change – remains a necessity, and that it is possible to combine it with reduced environmental footprint (including, but not limited to, mitigation). They argue that this dual challenge calls for structural transformation policies different from those implemented in the past, most importantly through a ‘systematic steering of investment behaviour in a socially agreed direction’ and encompassing policy coordination (limited evidence, medium agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"In order to permit progress on their SDG agendas, it is essential that countries develop visions of their future decarbonised sectoral production structure, including its ability to generate growth in incomes, employment and foreign exchange earnings. as well as the related spatial distribution of production, employment, and housing. To this extent, governance and institutional capacity matter, such as availability of tools to support long-term planning. A sectoral structure that permits strong growth is essential given strong associations between growth in per-capita incomes and progress on most SDGs (including those related to poverty; health; education; and access to water, sanitation, electricity, and roads; but not income equality), in part due to the fact that higher incomes provide both households and governments with resources that at least in part would be used to promote SDGs (Gable et al. 2015)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.7_p5,NO_TITLE,"The future viability of sectors will depend on the extent to which they can remain profitable while relying on lower-carbon energy. The challenge to identify alternative sectors of growth is particularly acute for countries that today depend on oil and natural gas for most of their foreign exchange and government revenues (Mirzoev et al. 2020). Changes in economic structure will also have gender implications since the roles of men and women vary across sectors. For example, in many developing countries, sectors in which women play a relatively important role, including agriculture and unpaid household services like collection of water and fuel wood, may be negatively affected by climate change (Roy 2018). It may thus be important to take complementary actions to address the gender implications of changes in economic structure."

For example, as suggested, the actions that influence the pace at which GHG emissions can be cut with political support may depend on taxation (including carbon taxes), investments in infrastructure, spending on R&D, changes in income distribution (influenced by transfers), and communication. In this light, it is important to consider the demands that alternative policy packages put on government policy-making efficiency and credibility as well as the roles of other enabling conditions. In fact, plans to undertake major reforms may provide governments with impetus to accelerate the enhancement of their capacities as part of the preparations (Karapin 2016; Withana 2016; Jakob et al. 2019)."

Overall, Baum et al. (2017) argue that low-income countries are likely not to have the fiscal space to undertake the investment entailed in reaching the SDGs. To create additional fiscal space, major options include improving tax recovery, reducing subsidies and levying additional taxes."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.8_p2,NO_TITLE,"Mitigation offers an opportunity to create additional fiscal space, and thus to serve the objectives outlined above, by creating a new source of revenue for the government via carbon taxation or emissions permit auctioning and by reducing existing expenditures via reduction in subsidies to fossil-fuel. The 1991 tax reform in Sweden is an early example in which environmental taxation (including, but not limited to, fossil fuel taxation) was introduced as part of a package primarily aimed at lowering the marginal tax rates (more than 80% at the time), at reducing other taxes, while keeping most of the welfare state. To do so, the tax base was broadened, including through environmental and carbon taxation (Sterner 2007). Once in place, the carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and its base broadened (Criqui et al. 2019)."

The potential is large, since only 13% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing schemes in 2019 (Watts et al. 2019) and since many countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon prices hope to promote. In 2018, the global subsidy value amounted to USD427 billion, some 10 times the payment for carbon use (Watts et al. 2019). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal space varies strongly across countries given differences in terms of current carbon prices and fuel subsidies."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing may be explained by the fact that most of the gains occur in the future and depend on actions across the globe, making them seem abstract and unpredictable, whereas the costs in the form of higher carbon prices are immediate (Karapin 2016). Furthermore, the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear to the public who, in addition, may not trust that the government will use budgetary savings according to stated plans. The latter may be due to various factors, including a history of limited government commitment and corruption (Withana 2016; Chadwick 2017; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019)."

Performance assessment is complicated by the effect of other policies and exogenous factors. Haites (2018) suggests that since 2008, other policies have probably contributed more to emission reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to achieve mitigation objectives. Emissions under ETSs have declined, with the exception of four systems without emissions caps (ibid). Every jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other policies that affect its GHG emissions."

Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, equivalent to the elimination of negative carbon prices, have been more successful when they have included complementary and transparent measures that enjoy popular support, accompanied by a strong communications component that explains the measures and stresses their benefits (Withana 2016; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.8_p7,NO_TITLE,"Part of the losses (and related calls for compensation or exemptions) due to carbon pricing are related to the fact that it hurts the competitiveness of sectors that face imports from countries with lower carbon prices, leading to ‘carbon leakage’ if carbon-intensive production (and related jobs) migrates from countries with relatively high carbon prices. Some research suggests that evidence that a border carbon tax (or adjustment), set on the basis of the carbon content of the import, including a downward adjustment on the basis of any carbon payments (taxes or other) already made before entry, could reduce carbon leakage while also raising additional revenue and encouraging carbon pricing in the exporting country (Withana 2016; Cosbey et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.8_p8,NO_TITLE,"The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), as well as momentum from climate actions by other countries and international climate agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 2016; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). In countries that export carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.8_p9,NO_TITLE,"There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers or earmarked for areas with positive environmental effects (e.g., Bachus et al. (2019) for Belgium, and Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer (2019) for Germany and the USA), as well as on the difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic consequences thereof) associated with the introduction of such instruments (Pereira et al. 2016). Similarly, ‘best practices’ have been drawn from past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Sovacool 2017). Specific policies, however, depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, employment, and trade, and institutional structure (including the functioning of markets and government capacity) (Kettner et al. 2019). As noted in Section 4.2.6, macroeconomic analysis finds that the overall economic implications of carbon pricing differ markedly depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing are used, and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for double dividend if the proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the most distortive taxes in the economy."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.8_p10,NO_TITLE,"In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and may not be sufficient to address the other objectives pursued. Even if the carbon price is high, the revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are eliminated. For example, Jakob et al. (2016) find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet a small part of their infrastructure spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak of 0.93% in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric tonne of CO2, to 0.48% in 2018, when the rate had reached USD132 (Jonsson et al. 2020; Statistics Sweden 2020). This means that governments that want to avoid a decline in the GDP share for total tax revenues over time would have to raise the intake from other taxes. However, it is here important to note that domestic tax hikes are likely to involve trade-offs since, at the same time as the spending they fund may provide various benefits, they may also reduce the capacity of households and the private sector to consume and invest, something that may reduce growth over time and reduced resources for spending in support of human development (Lofgren et al. 2013). It is also worth emphasising that restructuring of the fiscal system amount to changes in the social contract of the society (Combet and Hourcade 2017 and 2014), and thus represents a major economic and social decision."

wg3_ch04_4.4.1.9_p2,NO_TITLE,"Exclusionary mechanisms such as decreasing accessibility and affordability of inner-urban neighbourhoods is a major cause of suburbanisation of low- to middle-income households (e.g., Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018). Suburbanisation, in turn, is associated with higher transportation demand (Bento et al. 2005) and higher carbon footprints for households (Jones and Kammen 2014). Similarly, other studies find a significant positive link between housing prices and energy demand (Lampin et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.9_p3,NO_TITLE,"Reducing emissions from transport in cities through traditional climate policy instruments (e.g., through a carbon tax) is more difficult when inner-urban neighbourhoods are less accessible and less affordable, because exclusionary mechanisms act as a countervailing force to the rising transportation costs induced by the climate policy, pushing households outwards rather than inwards. Said differently, the costs of mitigating intra-city transportation emissions are higher when inner-urban housing prices are higher (Lampin et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.9_p4,NO_TITLE,"This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable can open up broader opportunities for suburban households to relocate in the face of increasing transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and middle-income households, who spend a greater portion of their income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be locked into locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs (e.g., households feeling helpless in front of rising fuel prices) and the economic costs of mitigation policies – as a lower price of carbon is likely to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.9_p5,NO_TITLE,"Making inner-cities neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable is a complex endeavour (Benner and Karner 2016). At the same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for a range of social, health and economic reasons. Revenues derived from climate policies could provide additional resources to support such programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use their revenues towards low-income groups (Karner and Marcantonio 2018). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains out of, or is only emerging in the debates surrounding the planning of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (IADB 2012; Grant 2015; Khosla and Bhardwaj 2019). Finally, from a political economy perspective, it is also interesting to note that (Bergquist et al. 2020) find higher support for climate policy packages in the USA when affordable housing programs are included."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.9_p6,NO_TITLE,"In addition, investment in infrastructure is critical to the development of decarbonised economic structures that generate growth, employment, and universal access to a wide range of services that are central to the SDG agenda: transportation, water, sanitation, electricity, flood protection, and irrigation. For low- and middle-income countries, annual costs of reaching these goals by 2030 and putting their economies on a path toward decarbonisation may range between 2% and 8% of GDP, with the level depending on spending efficiency. Notably, these costs need not exceed those of more polluting alternatives (Rozenberg and Fay 2019). For transportation, this involves a shift toward more public transportation (rail and bus), and decarbonised electricity for vehicles, combined with land-use policies that densify cities and reduce distances between homes and jobs. By influencing the spatial distribution of households and firms and the organisation of transportation, infrastructure has a strong bearing on GHG emissions and the costs of providing services to different populations. Depending on country context, the private sector may play a particularly important role in the financing of infrastructure (World Bank 2009; Klein 2015)."

Given this, it may be important to make sure that today’s investments be fully decarbonised at the start or that they later can be converted to zero carbon. Today’s investments in electric vehicles in settings where electricity is produced with fossil fuels is an example of convertible investments – they will be decarbonised once electricity production has switched to renewable energies. For capital stocks that cannot be decarbonised, countries may face costs of decommissioning well before the end of their useful lifetimes, especially when it is needed to respect country commitments to future full decarbonisation."

While this may be particularly challenging in developing countries, given large populations still lacking basic needs, previous development paths show that finding synergies in development and climate objectives in the AFOLU sector is possible. One example is Brazil, which has arguably shifted its development pathway to reduce emissions and make progress towards several SDGs, though progress is not linear. Over the past two decades, Brazil had made remarkable progress in implementing a sequence of policies across multiple sectors. This policy package simultaneously increased minimum wages of low income families, achieved universal energy access, and raised the quality of life and well-being for the large majority of the population (Da Silveira Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2017, 2018; La Rovere et al. 2018). This led to significant social benefits, reduction of income inequality and poverty eradication (Da Silveira Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2017), reflected in a decrease of the Gini coefficient and a rise in the human development index (La Rovere 2017)."

In parallel, public policies reinforced environmental regulation and command-and-control instruments to limit deforestation rates and implemented market-based mechanisms to provide benefits to those protecting local ecosystems and enhancing land-based carbon sinks (Sunderlin et al. 2014; Nunes et al. 2017; Hein et al. 2018; Simonet et al. 2019). The private sector, aligned with public policies and civil society, implemented the Amazon Soy Moratorium, a voluntary agreement that bans trading of soybeans from cropland associated with cleared Amazon rainforest and blacklists farmers using slave labour. This was achieved without undermining production of soybean commodities (Soterroni et al. 2019). As a result, between 2005 and 2012, the country halved its GHG emissions and reduced the rate of deforestation by 78% (INPE 2019a,b). This example shows that development delivering well-being can be accompanied by significant mitigation. A long-term and strategic vision was important in guiding enabling policies and mechanisms."

As a result, in 2020, deforestation exceeded 11,000 km 2, and reached the highest rate in the last 12 years (INPE 2020). The literature cautions that, if current policies and trends continue, the Amazon may reach an irreversible tipping point beyond which it will be impossible to remediate lost ecosystems and restore carbon sinks and indigenous people knowledge (Lovejoy and Nobre 2018; INPE 2019a; Nobre 2019). In addition, fossil fuel subsidies and other fiscal support of increased exploitation of oil resources may create carbon lock-ins that further inhibit low-carbon investments (Lefèvre et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.1.10_p4,NO_TITLE,"Brazil’s progress in mitigation depended significantly on reduced deforestation in the past. If deforestation rates keep on rising, mitigation efforts would need to shift to the energy sector. However, according to Rochedo et al. (2018), mitigation costs in the energy sector in Brazil are three times the costs of reducing deforestation and increasing land-based carbon sinks. Further mitigation strategies may depend on CCS in Brazil as elsewhere (Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016), though the economic feasibility of deployment is not yet clear (Section 4.2.5.4)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.2_p1,Development Pathways can Build Greater Capacity for Both Adaptation and Mitigation ,"Mitigation actions are strongly linked to adaptation. These connections come about because mitigation actions can be adaptive (e.g., some agroforestry projects) but also through policy choices (e.g., climate finance is allocated among adaptation or mitigation projects) and even biophysical links (e.g., climate trajectories, themselves determined by mitigation, can influence the viability of adaptation projects). As development pathways shape the levers and enablers available to a society (Section 4.3.1, Figure 4.7), a broader set of enabling conditions also helps with adaptation (medium evidence, high agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.2_p2,Development Pathways can Build Greater Capacity for Both Adaptation and Mitigation ,"Previous assessments have consistently recognised this linkage. The Paris Agreement includes mitigation and adaptation as key areas of action, through NDCs and communicating adaptation actions and plans. The Agreement explicitly recognises that mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation can count towards NDC targets. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 2014) emphasised that sustainable development is helpful in going beyond a narrow focus on separate mitigation and adaptation options and their specific co-benefits. The IPCC Special Report on climate change and land addresses GHG emissions from land-based ecosystems with a focus on the vulnerability of land-based systems to climate change. The report identifies the potential of changes to land use and land management practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to generate co-benefits that help meet other SDGs (Jian et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.2_p3,Development Pathways can Build Greater Capacity for Both Adaptation and Mitigation ,"A substantial literature detailing trade-offs and synergies between mitigation and adaptation exists and is summarised in the IPCC SR1.5 including energy system transitions; land and ecosystem transitions (including addressing food system efficiency, sustainable agricultural intensification, ecosystem restoration); urban and infrastructure system transitions (including land use planning, transport systems, and improved infrastructure for delivering and using power); industrial system transitions (including energy efficiency, bio-based and circularity, electrification and hydrogen, and industrial carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS); and carbon dioxide removal (including bioenergy with CCS, afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, and enhanced weathering) (IPCC 2018: Table 4.SM.5.1). Careful design of policies to shift development pathways towards sustainability can increase synergies and manage trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation (robust evidence, medium agreement)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.2_p4,Development Pathways can Build Greater Capacity for Both Adaptation and Mitigation ,"This section examines how development pathways can build greater adaptive and mitigative capacity, and then turns to several examples of mitigation actions with implications for adaptation where there is a notable link to development pathways and policy choices. These examples are in the areas of agriculture, blue carbon and terrestrial ecosystem restoration."
wg3_ch04_4.4.2.1_p1,Governance and institutional capacity ,"Previous IPCC assessments have reflected on making development more sustainable (IPCC et al. 2001; Sathaye et al. 2007; Fleurbaey et al. 2014). Other assessments have highlighted how ecosystem functions can support sustainable development and are critical to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement (IPBES 2019b). IPCC SR1.5 found that sustainable development pathways to 1.5°C broadly support and often enable transformations and that ‘sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity, and promote livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations ( high confidence)’ (IPCC 2018b: Section 5.3.1). With careful management, shifting development pathways can build greater adaptive and mitigative capacity, as further confirmed in recent literature (Schramski et al. 2018; Harvey et al. 2014; Ebi et al. 2014; Rosenbloom et al. 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Singh 2018; IPBES 2019b). The literature points to the challenge of design of specific policies and shifts in development pathways to achieve both mitigation and adaptation goals."
wg3_ch04_4.4.2.2_p1,Farming system approaches can benefit mitigation and adaptation ,"Mitigation actions can be adaptive and vice-versa. In particular, many nature-based solutions (NBS) for climate mitigation are adaptive (medium evidence, medium agreement). Multiple NBS are being pursued under current development pathways (Chapter 7), but shifting to sustainable development pathways may enable a wider set of nature-based mitigation solutions with adaptation benefits. An example of this would be a shift to more sustainable diets through guidelines, carbon taxes, or investment in R&D of animal product substitutes (Figure 13.2) which could reduce pressure on land and allow for implementation of multiple NBS. Many of these solutions are consistent with meeting other societal goals, including biodiversity conservation and other sustainable development goals (Griscom et al. 2017; Fargione et al. 2018; Tallis et al. 2018). However, there can be synergies and trade-offs in meeting a complex set of sustainability goals (e.g., biodiversity, Section 7.6.5 and 3.1.5)."

The following outline key risks and relevant hedging strategies identified in the literature."

Availability of foreign financial resources in countries with limited domestic savings (Baum et al. 2017) and availability of technology transfers (Glachant and Dechezleprêtre 2017) are some examples. Other external decisions with significant bearing on domestic action include mitigation policies in other countries (Dai et al. 2017), and especially in major trading partners, the lack of which can result in competitive disadvantage for sectors exposed to international competition (Alton et al. 2014). The international prices of the key commodities (notably energy), goods and services are important, notably when shifting development pathway is based on structural change (e.g., Willenbockel et al. 2017 for Ghana and Kenya)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Remedies include first devising policy packages that are, to the extent possible, robust to uncertainty regarding external decisions. For example, mitigation in the building sector is considered less problematic for competitiveness since the construction sector is less exposed to international competition. Remedies also include securing international cooperation to reduce the uncertainty that domestic decision-makers face about the international context. Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities and financing of transitions (Section 15.6), which can enable shifting development pathways. Cooperation can generate positive spill overs through technology diffusion (Section 13.6.6). Third, cooperation is not limited to governments. As discussed in Section 4.2.3, international cooperative initiatives among non-state actors (cities, economic branches, etc.) can also provide know-how, resources and stable cooperative frameworks that reduce uncertainty for individual actors (Section 14.5.5)."
wg3_ch04_4.4.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"As outlined in the examples in Section 4.4.1 above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex endeavours, on which there is limited experience and know-how from the past. An uncertainty is that parts of these policy packages may fail, in other words, under-deliver relative to the amount of mitigation and of transformations initially expected. For example, France has failed to meet its 2015–2018 carbon budget as housing retrofitting programs, in particular, have failed to deliver the expected amount of emission reductions (Haut Conseil pour le Climat 2019). There are two main options to tackle this risk. The first is to build in redundancy. The second is to anticipate that some parts of the policies will inevitably fail, and build-in monitoring and corrective mechanisms in a sequential decision-making process. To this regard, building institutions that can properly monitor, learn from and improve over time is critical (Nair and Howlett 2017)."

Even though decisions are no longer made ‘in a sea of uncertainty’ (Lave 1991), we know that new information will come over time, that may have significant bearing on the design and objectives of policies to shift development pathways and accelerate mitigation. New information may come from climate sciences (e.g., updated GWP values or available carbon budgets) (Quéré et al. 2018), impact sciences (e.g., re-evaluation of climate impacts associated with given emission pathways) (Ricke et al. 2018) or mitigation sciences (e.g., on availability of given technologies) (Lenzi et al. 2018; Giannousakis et al. 2020)."

Risks associated with long-lasting fossil-fuel power plants have been the object of particular attention. For example, Pfeiffer et al. (2018) estimate that even if the current pipeline of power plants was cancelled, about 20% of the existing capacity might be stranded to remain compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C pathways – implying that additional capital accumulation would lead to higher sunk costs associated with stranded assets (Ansar et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2015; Kriegler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018b)."

There is also a growing literature on hedging strategies for individual actors (e.g., firms or investors) in the face of the uncertainties associated with mitigation (e.g., policy uncertainty or the associated carbon price uncertainty; e.g., Andersson et al. 2016 or Morris et al. 2018). On the other hand, there is often limited discussion of uncertainty and of its implication for hedging strategies in the accelerated mitigation pathway literature. Exceptions include (Capros et al. 2019), who elicit ‘no-regret’ and ‘disruptive’ mitigation options for the EU through a detailed sensitivity analysis, and (Watson et al. 2015) who discuss flexible strategies for the UK energy sector transition in the face of multiple uncertainties."

In the COVID-19 case, for example, the experience of conducting many activities on-line, which reduces emissions from transport, may leave an imprint on how some of these activities are carried out in the post-COVID-19 world. Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics may increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate action. However, the emissions implications of recovery packages depend on choosing policies that support climate action while addressing the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 (Hepburn et al. 2020). Governments may be in a stronger position to do so due to their pivotal role in assuring the survival of many businesses during the pandemics.

Such processes are designed to manage the risk of inequitable or non-representative power dynamics (Helsinki Design Lab 2011; Boulle et al. 2015; Kahane 2012).

wg3_ch04_4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Equity is an ethical and at times economic imperative, but it is also instrumentally an enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated mitigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The literature supports a range of estimates of the net benefits – globally or nationally – of low-carbon transformation, and it identifies a number of difficulties in drawing definitive quantitative conclusions (e.g., comparisons of costs and benefits among different actors, the existence of non-economic impacts, comparison across time, uncertainty in magnitude) (Section 3.6). One of the most important of these dimensions is the distributional consequences of mitigation, as well as a range of equity considerations arising from the uncertainty in net benefits, as well as from the distribution of costs and benefits among winners and losers (Rendall 2019; Caney 2016; Lahn and Bradley 2016; Lenferna 2018a; Kartha et al. 2018b; Robiou Du Pont et al. 2017). Some equity approaches are even just seeking corrective justice including for historical emissions (Adler 2007). For an assessment of literature on fairness in NDCs, see Section 4.2.2.7."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Equity issues are often discussed in the literature via frameworks that are well-founded in the ethical literature and that have a strong bearing on effort-sharing, but have not yet been quantitatively modelled and expressed in the form of an emissions allocation quantified framework. These include, for example, ethical perspectives based in human rights (Johl and Duyck 2012), human capabilities (Klinsky et al. 2017b), environmental justice (Mohai et al. 2009; Schlosberg 2009), ecological debt (Srinivasana et al. 2008; Warlenius et al. 2015), transitional justice (Klinsky 2017; Klinsky and Brankovic 2018), and planetary boundaries (Häyhä et al. 2016)."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"While there is extensive literature on equity frameworks for national emissions allocations (CSO Equity Review 2015, 2017, 2018; Holz et al. 2018; Kemp-Benedict et al. 2018; Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen 2018; Fyson et al. 2020; Pozo et al. 2020; Pye et al. 2020), such studies have tended to focus on allocation of a global carbon budget among countries based on quantified equity frameworks. The implicit normative choices made in these analysis have limitations (Kartha et al. 2018a). Moreover, there are many ethical parameters that could be introduced to enrich the existing quantitative frameworks, such as progressivity (Holz et al. 2018), consumption-based accounting (Afionis et al. 2017), prioritarianism (Adler and Treich 2015 ), and a right to development (Moellendorf 2020). Introducing these ethical frames into conventional quantification approaches generally implies greater allocations for poorer and lower-emitting populations, suggesting that the approaches that are typically highlighted in emissions allocation analyses tends to favour wealthier and higher-emitting countries. Broader, more inclusive sharing of costs and burdens is seen as a way to enhance equity in procedures and outcomes."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Ultimately, equity consequences depend on how costs and benefits are initially incurred and how they are shared as per social contracts (Combet and Hourcade 2017), national policy, and international agreements. The literature suggests a relationship between the effectiveness of cooperative action and the perception of fairness of such arrangements. Winkler et al. (2018) demonstrate that countries have put forward a wide variety of indicators and approaches for explaining the fairness and ambition of their NDCs, reflecting the broader range of perspectives found in the moral philosophical literature cited above. Mbeva and Pauw (2016) further find that adaptation and financing issues take on greater salience in the national perspectives reflected in the NDCs."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Topics of equity and fairness have begun to receive a greater amount of attention within the energy and climate literature, namely through the approaches of gender and race (Pearson et al. 2017; Lennon 2017; Allen et al. 2019), climate justice (Roberts and Parks 2007; Routledge et al. 2018) (Roberts & Parks, 2006; Routledge et al. 2018), and energy justice (Sovacool and Dworkin 2014). While such approaches frequently envision justice and equity as an ethical imperative, justice also possesses the instrumental value of enabling deeper and more socially acceptable mitigation efforts (Klinsky and Winkler 2018 )."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"A concrete focal point on these issues has been that of ‘just transition’. Getting broad consensus for the transformational changes entailed in moving from a high- to a low-carbon economy means ‘leaving no one behind’, in other words, ensuring (sufficiently) equitable transition for the relevant affected individuals, workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Newell and Mulvaney, 2013; Jasanoff 2018). The concept of a ‘just transition’ owes its origin to the USA trade union movement of the 1980s. The earliest version of a just transition was called the ‘Superfund for Workers’ modelled on the 1980 Superfund program that designed federal funds for the clean-up of toxic substances from chemicals, mining and energy production (Stevis and Felli 2015). It was further taken up, for example in the collaboration of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in promoting ‘green jobs’ as integral elements of a just transition (ILO 2015; Rosemberg 2010). In recent years the concept of a ‘just transition’ has gained increased traction, for example incorporated in the outcome of the Rio+20 Earth Summit and more recently recognised in the preamble of the Paris Agreement, which states ‘the imperative of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities’ (UNFCCC 2015a). Some heads of state and government signed a Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration first introduced at COP24 in Poland (HoSG 2018)."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"The literature identifies targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and authorities to ensure that any negative social, environmental or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are minimised, while benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected (Healy and Barry 2017). While the precise definition varies by source, core elements tend to include: (i) investments in establishing low-emission and labour-intensive technologies and sectors (Mijn Cha et al. 2020); (ii) research and early assessment of the social and employment impacts of climate policies (Green and Gambhir 2020; Mogomotsi et al. 2018); (iii) social dialogue and democratic consultation of social partners and stakeholders (Swilling and Annecke 2012; Smith 2017); (iv) the creation of decent jobs; active labour markets policies; and rights at work (ILO 2015; UNFCCC 2016c); (v) fairness in energy access and use (Carley and Konisky 2020); (vi) economic diversification based on low-carbon investments; (vii) realistic training/retraining programs that lead to decent work; (viii) gender specific politics that promote equitable outcomes (Allwood 2020); (ix) the fostering of international cooperation and coordinated multilateral actions (Lenferna 2018b; Newell and Simms 2020); (x) redressing of past harms and perceived injustices (Setzer and Vanhala 2019; UNHRC 2020); and (xi) consideration of inter-generational justice concerns, such as the impacts of policy decisions on future generations (Newell and Mulvaney, 2013)."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"A just transition could therefore entail that the state intervenes more actively in the eradication of poverty, and creates jobs in lower-carbon sectors, in part to compensate for soon-to-be abandoned fossil-fuel-based sectors, and that governments, polluting industries, corporations and those more able to pay higher associated taxes pay for transition costs, provide a welfare safety net and adequate compensation for people, communities, places, and regions that have been impacted by pollution, marginalised or negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society (Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Le Billon and Kristoffersen 2020; Kartha et al. 2018b). Reducing climate impacts is another important dimension of equity, in that the poor who are least responsible for climate change are most vulnerable to its impacts (AR6 WGII, Chapter 8). Focusing on financial losses alone however can obscure an important distinction between losses incurred by corporations and states and losses experienced by workers and communities. Processes established in the name of a just transition are also at risk of being co-opted by incumbent interests and powerful/wealthy agents (Green and Gambhir, 2020). Policy interventions associated with good governance, democratic oversight, and legal recourse can help overcome attempted co-optation of just transition, or use of COVID-19 recovery packages for continued carbon lock-in (Hepburn et al. 2020; SEI et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p9,NO_TITLE,"The just transition concept has thus become an international focal point tying together social movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon transitions and to seek to protect workers and communities. It also forms a central pillar of the growing movement for a ‘Green New Deal’ – a roadmap for a broad spectrum of policies, programs, and legislation that aims to rapidly decarbonise the economy while significantly reducing economic inequality (Allam et al. 2021; Galvin and Healy 2020). The US Green New Deal Resolution (Ocasio-Cortez 2019) for example, positions structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and a just transition at its centre. The European Green Deal proposed in 2019 (European Commission 2019), including a €100 billion ‘Just Transition Mechanism’ to mitigate the social effects of transitioning away from jobs in fossil-based industries. National level green new deals with strong just transition components have been proposed in South Korea, Australia, Spain, UK, Puerto Rico, Canada, as well as regional proposals across Latin America and the Caribbean (Pollin 2020)."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p10,NO_TITLE,"A just transition at national, regional and local scales can help to ensure that workers, communities, frontline communities and the energy-poor are not left behind in the transition. Moreover, a just transition necessitates that rapid decarbonisation does not perpetuate asymmetries between richer and poorer states and people (UNHRC 2020). Alliances around a just transition in countries across the world take many forms (Box 4.6)."
wg3_ch04_4.5_p11,NO_TITLE,"As Figure 4.9 shows, no fewer than seven national commissions or task forces on a just transition existed as of 2020 as well as seven other sets of national policies and a multitude of other actors, networks, and movements. For instance, the German phase-out of coal subsidies involved a savings package for unemployed miners. Subsidy reform packages introduced by Iran, Namibia, the Philippines, Turkey, and United Kingdom provide similar compensating measures to affected groups (Sovacool 2017). Spain’s just transition plan for coal miners includes early retirement, redundancy packages, silicosis compensation, retraining for green jobs, and priority job placement for former miners."

wg3_ch04_4.6_p1,NO_TITLE,This section summarises knowledge gaps that require further research:
wg3_ch04_4.6_p2,NO_TITLE,•Literature on mitigation pathways at the national level remains skewed towards large emitters. Many low-income countries have very few or no studies at all (Lepault and Lecocq 2021) (Section 4.2) (Annex III). Development of new studies and inclusion of associated scenarios in updated mitigation national mitigation pathway database would enhance understanding of mitigation at national level.
wg3_ch04_4.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"•Ex ante and ex post analysis of mitigation action and of mitigation plans by non-state actors, and their relationship with mitigation action and plans by governments is limited (Section 4.2.3)."
wg3_ch04_4.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"• System analysis solutions are only beginning to be recognised in current literature on deep mitigation pathways, and rarely included in existing national policies or strategies (Section 4.2.5)."
wg3_ch04_4.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"•While the technology elements of accelerated mitigation pathways at national level are generally well documented, studies of the economic and social implications of such pathways remain scarce (Section 4.2.6)."
wg3_ch04_4.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"•Literature on the implication of development choices for emissions and for capacity to mitigate is limited (Section 4.3.2). In particular, more contributions from the research community working on development issues would be very useful here."
wg3_ch04_4.6_p7,NO_TITLE,"•Literature describing shifts in development pathways, and the conditions for such shifts (based on past experience or on models) remains scarce (Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.3 and 4.4.1). Studying shifts in development pathways requires new ways of thinking with interdisciplinary research and use of alternative frameworks and methods suited for understanding of change agents, determinants of change and adaptive management among other issues (Winkler 2018). Research is not only expected to produce knowledge and boost innovation, but also to help identify transformation pathways and to enlighten public debate and public decision-making on related political choices."
wg3_ch04_4.6_p8,NO_TITLE,"•Other research gaps concern the open ocean and blue carbon. There is limited knowledge about quantification of the blue carbon stocks. Research is required into what happens if the sequestration capacity of the ocean and marine ecosystems is damaged by climate change to the tipping point until the sink becomes an emitter, and on how to manage blue carbon (Section 4.4.2)."
wg3_ch04_4.6_p9,NO_TITLE,"•Knowledge is limited on: (i) linking equity frameworks on mitigation with adaptation and most importantly with loss and damage, (ii) applying ethical parameters to enrich many of the existing quantitative frameworks, to assess fairness and ambition of NDCs; (iii) extending equity frameworks to quantify equitable international support, as the difference between equity-based national emissions scenarios and national domestic emissions scenarios (Sections 4.2.2.7 and 4.5)."
wg3_ch04_FAQ 4.1 |	What is to be done over and above countries’ existing pledges under the Paris Agreement to keep global warming well below 2°C?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Current pledges and efforts under the PA aimed at keeping global warming below 2°C are not enough, falling short by 14 to 23 GtCO2- eq (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this Chapter). There is a further shortfall of about 4 to 7 GtCO2-eq in 2030 if the conditions are not fulfilled for those Parties that have made their pledges with conditions for support (Section 4.2.2.3). To cover up for these shortfalls will require taking actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Examples of such actions include shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’, such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the layout of many cities. Because these different actions are connected, it means all relevant companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation (Section 4.2.5). The deployment of low-emission technology depends upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilise investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political support and understanding), and the provision of relevant enabling conditions (Section 4.4.1). Encouraging stronger and more ambitious climate action by non-government and sub-national stakeholders, as well as international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) could make significant contributions to emissions reduction (Section 4.2.3)."
wg3_ch04_FAQ 4.2 |	What is to be done in the near term to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Increasing speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction faces important obstacles, that are rooted in the underlying structure of societies (Section 4.2.7). Addressing these obstacles amounts to shifting away from existing developmental trends (i.e., shifting development pathways, Cross-Chapter Box 5). This can be done by strengthening governance and institutional capacity, aligning technology and innovation systems with low-carbon development, facilitating behaviour change and providing adequate finance within the context of multi-objective policy packages and sequences (Section 4.4.1). Shifting development pathways towards sustainability broadens the scope for, and is thus a complement to, accelerated mitigation (Section 4.3)."
"wg3_ch04_FAQ 4.3 |	Is it possible to accelerate mitigation in the near term while there are so many other development priorities? (Education, health, employment, etc.)_p1",NO_TITLE,"It is possible to accelerate mitigation while addressing other developmental priorities by implementing measures that simultaneously address both climate and development goals. Casting mitigation in the broader context of development pathways provides additional opportunities to articulate both (Section 4.3.1.4). Policies such as progressive taxation, investment in public transport, regulatory transparency, commitment to multilateral environmental governance, fiscal incentives for private investments, international technology development and transfer initiatives, and risk disclosure and efforts to improve underlying enabling conditions (improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change and technological innovation, and provision of finance) address multiple objectives beyond mitigation, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, public health and welfare, providing energy access, providing formal housing, and providing mobility. How we manage our land and agriculture, growing cities, transport needs, our industries, and the way people are trained and employed all impact on GHG emissions and the options we have to reduce them. In turn, reducing GHG emissions can also contribute to reducing poverty, preventing hunger, improving health and wellbeing, and providing clean water and clean energy. Implementing right policies and investments can help to address the challenges of how to reduce emissions without constraining development. For example, in land use, widespread planting of a single tree species or crops for bioenergy (organic matter turned into renewable energy) could affect food and water supplies. Therefore, if bioenergy is to be relied upon to offset emissions, the right policies and investments are needed (see also Chapter 17)."
