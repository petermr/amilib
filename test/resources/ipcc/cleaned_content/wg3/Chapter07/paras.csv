Land-based mitigation measures represent some of the most important options currently available. They can both deliver carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and substitute for fossil fuels, thereby enabling emissions reductions in other sectors. The rapid deployment of AFOLU measures is essential in all pathways staying within the limits of the remaining budget for a 1.5°C target ( high confidence). Where carefully and appropriately implemented, AFOLU mitigation measures are uniquely positioned to deliver substantial co-benefits and help address many of the wider challenges associated with land management. If AFOLU measures are deployed badly then, when taken together with the increasing need to produce sufficient food, feed, fuel and wood, they may exacerbate trade-offs with the conservation of habitats, adaptation, biodiversity and other services. At the same time the capacity of the land to support these functions may be threatened by climate change itself ( high confidence). {IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7; IPCC AR6 WGII, 7.1, 7.6}"

Estimated anthropogenic net CO2 emissions from AFOLU (based on book-keeping models) result in a net source of +5.9 ± 4.1GtCO2 yr –1 between 2010 and 2019 with an unclear trend. Based on FAOSTAT or national GHG inventories, the net CO2 emissions from AFOLU were 0.0 to +0.8 GtCO2 yr –1 over the same period. There is a discrepancy in the reported CO2AFOLU emissions magnitude because alternative methodological approaches that incorporate different assumptions are used. If the managed and natural responses of all land to both anthropogenic environmental change and natural climate variability, estimated to be a gross sink of –12.5 ± 3.2 GtCO2 yr –1 for the period 2010–2019, are included with land use emissions, then land overall, constituted a net  sink of –6.6 ± 5.2 GtCO2 yr –1 in terms of CO2 emissions (medium confidence). {7.2, 7.2.2.5, Table 7.1; IPCC AR6 WGI}"

There are substantial regional differences, with losses of carbon generally observed in tropical regions and gains in temperate and boreal regions. Agricultural methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are estimated to average 157 ± 47.1 MtCH4 yr –1 and 6.6 ± 4.0 MtN2O yr –1 or 4.2 ± 1.3 and 1.8 ± 1.1 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (using IPCC AR6 GWP100 values for CH4 and N2O) respectively between 2010 and 2019. AFOLU CH4 emissions continue to increase ( high confidence), the main source of which is enteric fermentation from ruminant animals ( high confidence). Similarly, AFOLU N2O emissions are increasing, dominated by agriculture, notably from manure application, nitrogen deposition, and nitrogen fertiliser use ( high confidence). In addition to being a source and sink for GHG emissions, land plays an important role in climate through albedo effects, evapotranspiration and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their mix, although the combined role in total climate forcing is unclear and varies strongly with bioclimatic region and management type. {2.4.2.5, 7.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.3, 7.3}"

The economic potential is about half of the technical potential from AFOLU, and about 30–50% could be achieved under USD20 tCO2-eq –1.

Agriculture provides the second largest share of the mitigation potential, with 4.1 (1.7–6.7) GtCO2-eq yr –1 (up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1) from cropland and grassland soil carbon management, agroforestry, use of biochar, improved rice cultivation, and livestock and nutrient management. Demand-side measures including shifting to sustainable healthy diets, reducing food waste, and building with wood and biochemicals and bio-textiles have a mitigation potential of 2.2 (1.1–3.6) GtCO2-eq yr –1. Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR needs upfront investment. Sustainable intensification in agriculture, shifting diets, and reducing food waste could enhance efficiencies and reduce agricultural land needs, and are therefore critical for enabling supply-side measures such as reforestation, restoration, as well as decreasing CH4 and N2O emissions from agricultural production. In addition, emerging technologies (e.g., vaccines or inhibitors) have the potential to substantially increase CH4 mitigation potential beyond current estimates. AFOLU mitigation is not only relevant in countries with large land areas. Many smaller countries and regions, particularly with wetlands, have disproportionately high levels of AFOLU mitigation potential density. {7.4, 7.5}"
wg3_ch07_executive-summary_p6,NO_TITLE,"The economic and political feasibility of implementing AFOLU mitigation measures is hampered by persistent barriers. Assisting countries to overcome barriers will help to achieve significant short-term mitigation (medium confidence). Finance forms a critical barrier to achieving these gains as currently mitigation efforts rely principally on government sources and funding mechanisms which do not provide sufficient resources to enable the economic potential to be realised. Differences in cultural values, governance, accountability and institutional capacity are also important barriers. Climate change could also emerge as a barrier to AFOLU mitigation, although the IPCC AR6 WGI contribution to AR6 indicated that an increase in the capacity of natural sinks may occur, despite changes in climate (medium confidence). The continued loss of biodiversity makes ecosystems less resilient to climate change extremes and this may further jeopardise the achievement of the AFOLU mitigation potentials indicated in this chapter (IPCC AR6 WGII and IPBES) ( high confidence). {7.4, 7.6; IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7}"

The range of recent estimates for the technical bioenergy potential when constrained by food security and environmental considerations is5–50and50–250EJ yr–1by 2050 for residues and dedicated biomass production system respectively. These estimates fall within previously estimated ranges (medium agreement). Poorly planned deployment of biomass production and afforestation options for in-forest carbon sequestration may conflict with environmental and social dimensions of sustainability ( high confidence). The global technical CDR potential of BECCS by 2050 (considering only the technical capture of CO2 and storage underground) is estimated at 5.9 mean (0.5–11.3) GtCO2 yr –1, of which 1.6 (0.8–3.5) GtCO2 yr –1 is available at below USD100 tCO2–1 (medium confidence). Bioenergy and other bio-based products provide additional mitigation through the substitution of fossil fuels fossil-based products ( high confidence). These substitution effects are reported in other sectors. Wood used in construction may reduce emissions associated with steel and concrete use.

Such risks can best be managed if AFOLU mitigation is pursued in response to the needs and perspectives of multiple stakeholders to achieve outcomes that maximise synergies while limiting trade-offs (medium confidence). The results of implementing AFOLU measures are often variable and highly context specific. Depending on local conditions (e.g., ecosystem, climate, food system, land ownership) and management strategies (e.g., scale, method), mitigation measures have the potential to positively or negatively impact biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, water availability and quality, soil productivity, rights infringements, food security, and human well-being. Mitigation measures addressing GHGs may also affect other climate forcers such as albedo and evapotranspiration. Integrated responses that contribute to mitigation, adaptation, and other land challenges will have greater likelihood of being successful ( high confidence); measures which provide additional benefits to biodiversity and human well-being are sometimes described as ‘Nature-Based Solutions’. {7.1, 7.4, 7.6}"
wg3_ch07_executive-summary_p9,NO_TITLE,"AFOLU mitigation measures have been well understood for decades but deployment remains slow and emissions trends indicate unsatisfactory progress despite beneficial contributions to global emissions reduction from forest-related options (high confidence). Globally, the AFOLU sector has so far contributed modestly to net mitigation, as past policies have delivered about 0.65 GtCO2 yr –1 of mitigation during 2010–2019 or 1.4% of global gross emissions ( high confidence). The majority (>80%) of emission reduction resulted from forestry measures ( high confidence). Although the mitigation potential of AFOLU measures is large from a biophysical and ecological perspective, its feasibility is hampered by lack of institutional support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, fragmented land ownership, and uncertain permanence effects. Despite these impediments to change, AFOLU mitigation options are demonstrably effective and with appropriate support can enable rapid emission reductions in most countries. {7.4, 7.6}"
wg3_ch07_executive-summary_p10,NO_TITLE,"Concerted, rapid and sustained effort by all stakeholders, from policy makers and investors to land owners and managers is a pre-requisite to achieving high levels of mitigation in the AFOLU sector (highconfidence).

This is well short of the more than USD400 billion yr –1 that is estimated to be necessary to deliver the up to 30% of global mitigation effort envisaged in deep mitigation scenarios (medium confidence). This estimate of the global funding requirement is smaller than current subsidies provided to agriculture and forestry. Making this funding available would require a change in flows of money and determination of who pays. A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies would greatly advance mitigation. Effective policy interventions and national (investment) plans as part of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), specific to local circumstances and needs, are urgently needed to accelerate the deployment of AFOLU mitigation options. These interventions are effective when they include funding schemes and long-term consistent support for implementation with governments taking the initiative together with private funders and non-state actors. {7.6}"

The principal accounting approaches are national GHG inventories (NGHGI) and global modelling approaches. NGHGI, based on IPCC guidelines, consider a much larger area of forest to be under human management than global models. NGHGI consider the fluxes due to human-induced environmental change on this area to be anthropogenic and are thus reported. Global models, 2  in contrast, consider these fluxes to be natural and are excluded from the total reported anthropogenic land CO2 flux. To enable a like-with-like comparison, the remaining cumulative global CO2 emissions budget can be adjusted (medium confidence).

There is a need to include a greater suite of mitigation measures in IAMs, informed by more realistic assessments that take into account local circumstances and socio-economic factors and cross-sector synergies and trade-offs. Finally, there is a critical need for more targeted research to develop appropriate country-level, locally specific, policy and land management response options.

wg3_ch07_7.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) is unique due to its capacity to mitigate climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, as well as enhance removals (IPCC 2019). However, despite the attention on AFOLU since early 1990s it was reported in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) as accounting for almost a quarter of anthropogenic emission (IPCC, 2019), with three main GHGs associated with AFOLU; carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Overall emission levels had remained similar since the publication of AR4 (Nabuurs et al. 2007). The diverse nature of the sector, its linkage with wider societal, ecological and environmental aspects and the required coordination of related policy, was suggested to make implementation of known and available supply- and demand-side mitigation measures particularly challenging (IPCC 2019). Despite such implementation barriers, the considerable mitigation potential of AFOLU as a sector on its own and its capacity to contribute to mitigation within other sectors was emphasised, with land-related measures, including bioenergy, estimated as capable of contributing between 20% and 60% of the total cumulative abatement to 2030 identified within transformation pathways (IPCC 2018). However, the vast mitigation potential from AFOLU initially portrayed in literature and in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), as explored in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change of 1.5°C (SR1.5), is being questioned in terms of feasibility (Roe et al. 2021) and a more balanced perspective on the role of land in mitigation is developing, while at the same time, interest by private investors in land-based mitigation is increasing fast."
wg3_ch07_7.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The SRCCL (IPCC 2019) outlined with medium evidence and medium agreement  that supply-side agriculture and forestry measures had an economic (at USD100 tCO2-eq –1) mitigation potential of 7.2–10.6 GtCO2-eq –1 in 2030 (using GWP100 and multiple IPCC values for CH4 and N2O) of which about a third was estimated as achievable at <USD20 tCO2-eq –1. Agricultural measures were reported as sensitive to carbon price, with cropland and grazing land soil organic carbon management having the greatest potential at USD20 tCO2-eq –1 and restoration of organic soils at USD100 tCO2-eq –1. Forestry measures were less sensitive to carbon price, but varied regionally, with reduced deforestation, forest management and afforestation having the greatest potential depending on region. Although demand-side measures related to food could in theory make a large contribution to mitigation, in reality the contribution has been very small. Overall, the dependency of mitigation within AFOLU on a complex range of factors, from population growth, economic and technological developments, to the sustainability of mitigation measures and impacts of climate change, was suggested to make realisation highly challenging (IPCC 2019)."
wg3_ch07_7.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Land can only be part of the solution alongside rapid emission reduction in other sectors (IPCC 2019). It was recognised that land supports many ecosystem services on which human existence, well-being and livelihoods ultimately depend. Yet over-exploitation of land resources was reported as driving considerable and unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss, and wider environmental degradation (IPBES 2019b; IPCC 2019). Urgent action to reverse this trend was deemed crucial in helping to accommodate the increasing demands on land and enhance climate change adaptation capacity. There was  high confidence that global warming was already causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events, impacting ecosystems, food security, disturbances and production processes, with existing (and new) carbon stocks in soils and biomass at serious risk. The impact of land cover on regional climate (through biophysical effects) was also highlighted, although there was no confidence regarding impacts on global climate."

Models indicated land (including the natural sink) to have very likely  provided a net removal of CO2 between 2007 and 2016. As in AR5, land cover change, notably deforestation, was identified as a major driver of anthropogenic CO2 emissions while agriculture was a major driver of the increasing anthropogenic CH4 and N2O emissions."

However, some mitigation measures were suggested to not compete with other land uses, while also having multiple co-benefits, including adaptation capacity and potential synergies with some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in AR5, there was large uncertainty surrounding mitigation within AFOLU, in part because current carbon stocks and fluxes are unclear and subject to temporal variability. Additionally, the non-additive nature of individual measures that are often inter-linked and the highly context specific applicability of measures, causes further uncertainty. Many AFOLU measures were considered well-established and some achievable at low to moderate cost, yet contrasting economic drivers, insufficient policy, lack of incentivisation and institutional support to stimulate implementation among the many stakeholders involved, in regionally diverse contexts, was recognised as hampering realisation of potential."

This CDR component was deemed crucial to limit climate change and its impacts, which would otherwise lead to enhanced release of carbon from land. However, the SRCCL emphasised that mitigation cannot be pursued in isolation. The need for integrated response options, that mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also deal with land degradation and desertification, while enhancing food and fibre security, biodiversity and contributing to other SDGs has been made clear (IPCC 2019; IPBES 2019a; IPBES-IPCC 2021)."

Mitigation within these sectors may in part, be dependent on contributions from land and the AFOLU sector, with interactions between all sectors discussed in Chapter 12.

Assessment is made in the context that land-mitigation is expected to contribute roughly 25% of the 2030 mitigation pledged in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (Grassi et al. 2017), yet very few countries have provided details on how this will be achieved. In light of AR5 and the SRCCL findings, that indicate large land-based mitigation potential, considerable challenges to its realisation, but also a clear nexus at which humankind finds itself, whereby current land management, driven by population growth and consumption patterns, is undermining the very capacity of land, a finite resource, to support wider critical functions and services on which humankind depends. Mitigation within AFOLU is occasionally and wrongly perceived as an opportunity for in-action within other sectors. AFOLU simply cannot compensate for mitigation shortfalls in other sectors. As the outcomes of many critical challenges (UNEP 2019), including biodiversity loss (IPBES 2019a) and soil degradation (FAO and ITPS 2015), are inextricably linked with how we manage land, the evaluation and assessment of AFOLU is crucial.

AFOLU is the only GHG sector to currently include anthropogenic sinks. A range of methodological approaches and data have been applied to estimating AFOLU emissions and removals, each developed for their own purposes, with estimates varying accordingly. Since the SRCCL (Jia et al. 2019), emissions estimates have been updated (Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.3), while the assessment of biophysical processes and short-lived climate forcers (Section 7.2.4) is largely unchanged.

While fluxes of CO2 (Section 7.2.2) are predominantly from LULUCF and fluxes of CH4 and N2O (Section 7.2.3) are predominantly from agriculture, fluxes of all three gases are associated with both sub-sectors.

Land fluxes respond naturally to human-induced environmental change (e.g., climate change, and the fertilising effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition), known as ‘indirect anthropogenic effects’, and also to ‘natural effects’ such as climate variability (IPCC 2010) (Table 7.1 and Section 7.2.2). This showed a removal of –12.5 ± 3.2 GtCO2 yr –1 (medium confidence) from the atmosphere during 2010–2019 according to global dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) models (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) 31% of total anthropogenic net emissions of CO2 from all sectors. It is likely that the NGHIs and FAOSTAT implicitly cover some part of this sink and thus provide a net CO2AFOLU balance with some 5 GtCO2 lower net emissions than according to bookkeeping models, with the overall net CO2 value close to being neutral. Model results and atmospheric observations concur that, when combining both anthropogenic (AFOLU) and natural processes on the entire land surface (the total ‘land–atmosphere flux’), the land was a global net sink for CO2 of –6.6 ± 4.6 GtCO2 yr –1 with a range for 2010 to 2019 from –4.4 to –8.4 GtCO2 yr –1.

The natural land sink is  highly likely  to be affected by both future AFOLU activity and climate change (IPCC AR6 WGI Box 5.1 and Figure SPM. 7), whereby under more severe climate change, the amount of carbon stored on land would still increase although the relative share of the emissions that land takes up, declines."

Anthropogenic land GHG fluxes (direct and indirect effects) are defined as all those occurring on managed land, that is, where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions (IPCC 2006, 2019). GHG fluxes from unmanaged land are not reported in NGHGIs because they are assumed to be non-anthropogenic.

FAOSTAT also estimate emissions from forest fires and other land uses (organic soils), following IPCC methods (Prosperi et al. 2020).

While such data can strongly support monitoring reporting and verification, estimates of forest carbon fluxes directly from Earth Observation (EO) data vary considerably in both their magnitude and sign (i.e., whether forests are a net source or sink of carbon). For the period 2005–2017, net tropical forest carbon fluxes were estimated as –0.4 GtCO2 yr –1 (Fan et al. 2019); 0.58 GtCO2 yr –1 (Grace et al. 2014); 1.6 GtCO2 yr –1 (Baccini et al. 2017) and 2.87 GtCO2 yr –1 (Achard et al. 2014). Differences can in part be explained by spatial resolution of the datasets, the definition of ‘forest’ and the inclusion of processes and methods used to determine degradation and growth in intact and secondary forests, or the changes in algorithm over time (Palahí et al. 2021). A recent global study integrated ground observations and remote sensing data to map forest-related GHG emissions and removals at a high spatial resolution (30 m spatial scale), although it only provides an average estimate of annual carbon loss over 2001–2019 (Harris et al. 2021).

Yet disturbances such as fire and repeated deforestation cycles due to shifting cultivation over the period 1985 to 2017, were found to reduce the regrowth rates of secondary forests by 8 to 55% depending on the climate region of regrowth (Heinrich et al. 2021)."

Reconciling the differences, in other words, making estimates comparable, can build confidence in land-related CO2 estimates, for example for the purpose of assessing collective progress in the context of the Global Stocktake (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter). The difference largely results from greater estimated CO2 in NGHGIs, mostly occurring in forests (Grassi et al. 2021). This difference is potentially a consequence of: (i) simplified and/or incomplete representation of management in global models (Popp et al. 2017; Pongratz et al. 2018), for example, concerning impacts of forest management in biomass expansion and thickening (Nabuurs et al. 2013; Grassi et al. 2017), (ii) inaccurate and/or incomplete estimation of LULUCF fluxes in NGHGIs (Grassi et al. 2017), especially in developing countries, primarily in non-forest land uses and in soils, and (iii) conceptual differences in how global models and NGHGIs define ‘anthropogenic’ CO2 flux from land (Grassi et al. 2018).

The resulting apparent increase in anthropogenic sink reflects simply a reallocation of a CO2 flux previously labelled as natural, and thus does not reflect a mitigation action. These changes do not affect non-LULUCF emissions. However, since the atmosphere concentration is a combination of CO2 emissions from LULUCF and from fossil fuels, the proposed land-related adjustments also influence the NGHGI-comparable economy-wide (all sector) CO2 pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1d)."

Regarding AFOLU, the SRCCL and AR5 (Jia et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2014) identified three global non-CO2 emissions data sources: EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021), FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a; Tubiello, 2019) and the USA EPA (USEPA 2019). Methodological differences have been previously discussed (Jia et al. 2019). In accordance with Chapter 2, this report, EDGAR data are used in Table 7.1 and Figure 7.3. It is important to note that in terms of AFOLU sectoral CH4 and N2O emissions, only FAOSTAT provides data on AFOLU emissions, while EDGAR and USEPA data consider just the agricultural component. However, the mean of values across the three databases for both CH4 and N2O, fall within the assessed uncertainty bounds (30 and 60% for CH4 and N2O respectively, Section 2.2.1, in this report) of EDGAR data. NGHGIs annually submitted to the UNFCCC (Section 7.2.2.3) provide national AFOLU CH4 and N2O data, as included in the SRCCL (Jia et al. 2019). Aggregation of NGHGIs to indicate global emissions must be considered with caution, as not all countries compile inventories, nor submit annually. Additionally, NGHGIs may incorporate a range of methodologies for CH4 and N2O accounting (e.g., van der Weerden et al. 2016; Ndung’u et al. 2019; Thakuri et al. 2020), making comparison difficult. The analysis of complete AFOLU emissions presented here, is based on FAOSTAT data. For agricultural specific discussion, analysis considers EDGAR, FAOSTAT and USEPA data."

The latest data (FAO 2021a, 2020b) highlight a trend of growing AFOLU CH4 emissions, with a 10% increase evident between 1990 and 2019, despite year-to-year variation. Forestry and other land use (FOLU) CH4 emission sources include biomass burning on forest land and combustion of organic soils (peatland fires) (FAO 2020c). The agricultural share of AFOLU CH4 emissions remains relatively unchanged, with the latest data indicating agriculture to have accounted for 89% of emissions on average between 1990 and 2019. The SRCCL reported with medium evidence and  high agreement  that ruminants and rice production were the most important contributors to overall growth trends in atmospheric CH4 (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data confirm this in terms of agricultural emissions, with  agreement between databases that agricultural CH4 emissions continue to increase and that enteric fermentation and rice cultivation remain the main sources (Figure 7.7). The proportionally higher emissions from rice cultivation indicated by EDGAR data compared to the other databases, may result from the use of a Tier 2 methodology for this source within EDGAR (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019)."

The latest FAOSTAT data (FAO 2020b, 2021a) document a 25% increase in AFOLU N2O emissions between 1990 and 2019, with the average share from agriculture remaining approximately the same (96%). Agricultural soils were identified in the SRCCL and in recent literature as a dominant emission source, notably due to nitrogen fertiliser and manure applications to croplands, and manure production and deposition on pastures (Jia et al. 2019; Tian et al. 2020).

However, all databases indicate that emissions declined in Eurasia and Europe from 1990 levels, in accordance with specific environmental regulations put in place since the late 1980s (Tubiello 2019; European Environment Agency 2020; Tian et al. 2020), but generally suggest increases in both regions since 2010."
wg3_ch07_7.2.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Using FAOSTAT data, the SRCCL estimated average CH4 emissions from AFOLU to be 161.2 ± 43 MtCH4 yr –1 for the period 2007–2016, representing 44% of total anthropogenic CH4 emissions, with agriculture accounting for 88% of the AFOLU component (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data (FAO 2021a, 2020b) highlight a trend of growing AFOLU CH4 emissions, with a 10% increase evident between 1990 and 2019, despite year-to-year variation. Forestry and other land use (FOLU) CH4 emission sources include biomass burning on forest land and combustion of organic soils (peatland fires) (FAO 2020c). The agricultural share of AFOLU CH4 emissions remains relatively unchanged, with the latest data indicating agriculture to have accounted for 89% of emissions on average between 1990 and 2019. The SRCCL reported with medium evidence and  high agreement  that ruminants and rice production were the most important contributors to overall growth trends in atmospheric CH4 (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data confirm this in terms of agricultural emissions, with  agreement between databases that agricultural CH4 emissions continue to increase and that enteric fermentation and rice cultivation remain the main sources (Figure 7.7). The proportionally higher emissions from rice cultivation indicated by EDGAR data compared to the other databases, may result from the use of a Tier 2 methodology for this source within EDGAR (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019)."

A recent comprehensive review confirms agriculture as the principal driver of the growing atmospheric N2O concentration (Tian et al. 2020). The latest FAOSTAT data (FAO 2020b, 2021a) document a 25% increase in AFOLU N2O emissions between 1990 and 2019, with the average share from agriculture remaining approximately the same (96%). Agricultural soils were identified in the SRCCL and in recent literature as a dominant emission source, notably due to nitrogen fertiliser and manure applications to croplands, and manure production and deposition on pastures (Jia et al. 2019; Tian et al. 2020). There is agreement within latest data that agricultural soils remain the dominant source (Figure 7.7)."

EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021), FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a) and USEPA (USEPA 2019) data suggest aggregated agricultural emissions (CO2-eq) to have increased since 1990, by 19% (1990–2019), 15% (1990–2019) and 21% (1990–2015) respectively, with all databases identifying enteric fermentation and agricultural soils as the dominant agricultural emissions sources."

Eurasia was characterised by notable emission reductions (–58%), principally as a result of a sharp decline (–63%) between 1990 and 1999.

Asia was identified as responsible for 89% of rice cultivation emissions, which were reported as increasing (Jia et al. 2019). Considering classification by ten IPCC regions, data suggest enteric fermentation to have dominated emissions in all regions since 1990, except in South-East Asia and Pacific, where rice cultivation forms the principal source (FAO 2021; USEPA 2019). The different databases broadly indicate the same regional CH4 emission trends, though the indicated absolute change differs due to methodological differences (Section 7.2.3.1). All databases indicate considerable emissions growth in Africa since 1990 and that this region recorded the greatest regional increases in emissions from both enteric fermentation and rice cultivation since 2010.

wg3_ch07_7.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Despite new literature, general conclusions from the SRCCL and WGI-AR6 on biophysical effects and short-lived climate forcers remain the same. Changes in land conditions from land cover change or land management jointly affect water, energy, and aerosol fluxes (biophysical fluxes) as well as GHG fluxes (biogeochemical fluxes) exchanged between the land and atmosphere ( high agreement , robust evidence) (Anderson et al. 2011; O’Halloran et al. 2012; Alkama and Cescatti 2016; Naudts et al. 2016; Erb et al. 2017). There is  high confidence that changes in land condition do not just have local impacts but also have non-local impacts in adjacent and more distant areas (Pielke et al. 2011; Mahmood et al. 2014) which may contribute to surpassing climate tipping points (Nepstad et al. 2008; Brando et al. 2014). Non-local impacts may occur through: GHG fluxes and subsequent changes in radiative transfer, changes in atmospheric chemistry, thermal, moisture and surface pressure gradients creating horizontal transport (advection) (de Vrese et al. 2016; Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010) and vertical transport (convection and subsidence) (Devaraju et al. 2018). Although regional and global biophysical impacts emerge from model simulations (Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010; de Vrese et al. 2016; Devaraju et al. 2018), especially if the land condition has changed over large areas, there is very low agreement  on the location, extent and characteristics of the non-local effects across models. Recent methodological advances, empirically confirmed changes in temperature and precipitation owing to distant changes in forest cover (Cohn et al. 2019; Meier et al. 2021)."

Afforestation/reforestation (Lejeune et al. 2018; Strandberg and Kjellström 2019), urbanisation (Li and Bou-Zeid 2013) and irrigation (Mueller et al. 2016 and Thiery et al. 2017) modulate the likelihood, intensity, and duration of many extreme events including heatwaves ( high confidence) and heavy precipitation events (medium confidence) (Haberlie et al. 2015). There is  high confidence and  high agreement  that afforestation in the tropics (Perugini et al. 2017), irrigation (Alter et al. 2015; Mueller et al. 2016) and urban greening result in local cooling,  high agreement  and medium confidence on the impact of tree growth form (deciduous vs evergreen) (Naudts et al. 2016; Luyssaert et al. 2018 and Schwaab et al. 2020), and low agreement  on the impact of wood harvest, fertilisation, tillage, crop harvest, residue management, grazing, mowing, and fire management on the local climate."

The following analysis aligns with the drivers typology used by IPBES (2019b) and the Global Environmental Outlook (UNEP 2019). Drivers are divided into direct drivers resulting from human decisions and actions concerning land use and land-use change, and indirect drivers that operate by altering the level or rate of change of one or more direct drivers. Although drivers of emissions in agriculture and FOLU are presented separately, they are interlinked, operating in many complex ways at different temporal and spatial scales, with outcomes depending on their interactions. For example, deforestation in tropical forests is a significant component of sectorial emissions. A review of deforestation drivers’ studies published between 1996 and 2013, indicated a wide range of factors associated with deforestation rates across many analyses and studies, covering different regions (Busch and Ferretti-Gallon 2017) (Figure 7.9). Higher agricultural prices were identified as a key driver of deforestation, while law enforcement, area protection, and ecosystem services payments were found to be important drivers of reduced deforestation, while timber activity did not show a consistent impact."
wg3_ch07_7.3.1_p1,Conversion of Natural Ecosystems to Agriculture ,"The global forest area in 2020 is estimated at 4.1 billion ha, representing 31% of the total land area (FAO 2020a). Most forests are situated in the tropics (45%), followed by boreal (27%), temperate (16%) and subtropical (11%) domains. Considering regional distribution of global forest area, Europe and the Russian Federation accounts for 25%, followed by South America (21%), North and Central America (19%), Africa (16%), Asia (15%) and Oceania (5%). However, a significant share (54%) of the world’s forest area concerns five countries – The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the USA and China (FAO 2020a). Forest loss rates differ among regions though the global trend is towards a net forest loss (UNEP 2019). The global forest area declined by about 178 Mha in the 30 years from 1990 to 2020 (FAO 2020a). The rate of net forest loss has decreased since 1990, a result of reduced deforestation in some countries and forest gains in others. The annual net loss of forest area declined from 7.8 Mha in 1990–2000, to 5.2 Mha in 2000–2010, to 4.7 Mha in 2010–2020, while the total growing stock in global forests increased (FAO 2020a). The rate of decline in net forest loss during the last decade was due mainly to an increase in the rate of forest gain (i.e., afforestation and the natural expansion of forests)."

The area of other wooded land decreased by 30.6 Mha between 1990 and 2020 with larger declines between 1990–2000 (FAO 2020a). There are still significant challenges in monitoring the area of other wooded land, largely associated with difficulties in measuring tree-canopy cover in the range of 5–10%.The global area of mangroves, one of the most productive terrestrial ecosystems (Neogi 2020a), has also experienced a significant decline (Thomas et al. 2017; Neogi 2020b), with a decrease of 1.0 Mha between 1990 and 2020 (FAO 2020a) due to agriculture and aquaculture (Bhattarai 2011; Ajonina et al. 2014; Webb et al. 2014; Giri et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2017; Fauzi et al. 2019).

Data indicate changes in how agricultural land is used. Between 2000 and 2019, the area classified as permanent meadow and pasture decreased (–6%) while cropland area (under arable production and temporary crops) increased (+2%). A key driver of this change has been a general trend of intensification, including in livestock production (Barger et al. 2018; OECD/FAO 2019; UNEP 2019), whereby less grazing land is supporting increasing livestock numbers in conjunction with greater use of crops as livestock feed (Barger et al. 2018). The share of feed crops, such as maize and soybean, of global crop production is projected to grow as the demand for animal feed increases with further intensification of livestock production (OECD/FAO 2019).

Increase of land values of areas adjacent to roads also drives speculation and deforestation related to land tenure (Fearnside 2015). If poorly planned, infrastructure can facilitate fires, illegal mining, and wildlife poaching with consequences for GHG emissions and biodiversity conservation. However, some initiatives are providing new approaches for better planning and then limit environmental and societal impacts . "
wg3_ch07_box-7.1_p4,Extractive Industry Development ,"Although the number and extent of protected areas has increased markedly in recent decades (Watson et al. 2014), many other indicators reveal that nature is in broad retreat. For example, the total area of intact wilderness is declining rapidly worldwide (Watson et al. 2016), 70% of the world’s forests are now less than 1 km from a forest edge (Haddad et al. 2015), the extent of tropical forest fragmentation is accelerating exponentially (Taubert et al. 2018). One of the most direct and immediate driver of deforestation and biodiversity decline is the dramatic expansion of roads and other transportation infrastructure (Laurance et al. 2014a; Laurance and Arrea 2017; Alamgir et al. 2017)."

Much road expansion is poorly planned. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for roads and other infrastructure are typically too short term and superficial to detect rare species or assess long-term or indirect impacts of projects (Flyvbjerg 2009; Laurance and Arrea 2017). Another limitation is the consideration of each project in isolation from other existing or planned developments (Laurance et al. 2014b). Hence, EIAs alone are inadequate for planning infrastructure projects and assessing their broader environmental, social, and financial impacts and risks (Laurance et al. 2015a; Alamgir et al. 2017, 2018)."

For example, the Global Roadmap strategy has been used in parts of South-East Asia (Sloan et al. 2018), Indochina (Balmford et al. 2016), and sub-Saharan Africa (Laurance et al. 2015b) to devise land-use zoning that can help optimise the many risks and rewards of planned infrastructure projects."

Due to declining ore grades, more ore needs to be processed to meet demand, with extensive use of open cast mining. A low-carbon future may be more mineral intensive with, for example, clean energy technologies requiring greater inputs in comparison to fossil-fuel-based technologies (Hund et al. 2020). Mining presents cumulative environmental impacts, especially in intensively mined regions (UNEP 2019). The impact of mining on deforestation varies considerably across minerals and countries. Mining causes significant changes to the environment, for example, through mining infrastructure establishment, soil erosion, urban expansion to support a growing workforce and development of mineral commodity supply chains (Sonter et al. 2015). The increasing consumption of gold in developing countries, increased prices, and uncertainty in financial markets is identified as driving gold mining and associated deforestation in the Amazon region (Alvarez-Berrios and Mitchell Aide 2015; Dezécache et al. 2017; Asner and Tupayachi 2017; Espejo et al. 2018). The total estimated area of gold mining throughout the region increased by about 40% between 2012 and 2016 (Asner and Tupayachi 2017). In the Brazilian Amazon, mining significantly increased forest loss up to 70 km beyond mining lease boundaries, causing 11,670 km 2 of deforestation between 2005 and 2015, representing 9% of all Amazon forest loss during this time (Sonter et al. 2015)."

Mining presents cumulative environmental impacts, especially in intensively mined regions (UNEP 2019). The impact of mining on deforestation varies considerably across minerals and countries. Mining causes significant changes to the environment, for example, through mining infrastructure establishment, soil erosion, urban expansion to support a growing workforce and development of mineral commodity supply chains (Sonter et al. 2015). The increasing consumption of gold in developing countries, increased prices, and uncertainty in financial markets is identified as driving gold mining and associated deforestation in the Amazon region (Alvarez-Berrios and Mitchell Aide 2015; Dezécache et al. 2017; Asner and Tupayachi 2017; Espejo et al. 2018).

In addition to enteric fermentation, both CH4 and N2O emissions from manure management (i.e., manure storage and application) and deposition on pasture, make livestock the main agricultural emissions source (Tubiello 2019). The AR5 reported increases in populations of all major livestock categories between the 1970s and 2000s, including ruminants, with increasing numbers directly linked with increasing CH4 emissions (Smith et al. 2014). The SRCCL identified managed pastures as a disproportionately high N2O emissions source within grazing lands, with medium confidence that increased manure production and deposition was a key driver (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data (FAO 2021c) indicate continued global livestock population growth between 1990 and 2019 (Figure 7.10), including increases of 18% in cattle and buffalo numbers, and 30% in sheep and goat numbers, corresponding with CH4 emission trends. Data also indicate increased productivity per animal for example, average increases of 16% in beef, 17% in pig meat and 70% in whole (cow) milk per respective animal between 1990 and 2019 (FAO 2021c). Despite these advances leading to reduced emissions per unit of product (calories, meat and milk) (FAO 2016; Tubiello 2019), increased individual animal productivity generally requires increased inputs (e.g., feed) and this generates increased emissions (Beauchemin et al. 2020). Manipulation of livestock diets, or improvements in animal genetics or health may counteract some of this. In addition, the production of inputs to facilitate increased animal productivity, may indirectly drive further absolute GHG emissions along the feed supply chain."

Available data document increases in total meat and milk consumption by 24 and 22% respectively between 1990 and 2013, as indicated by average annual per capita supply (FAO 2017a). Updated data indicate that trends of increasing consumption continued between 2014 and 2018 (FAO 2021d).

The latest data indicate the global harvested area of rice to have grown by 11% between 1990 and 2019, with total paddy production increasing by 46%, from 519 Mt to 755 Mt (FAO 2021c). Global rice production is projected to increase by 13% by 2028 compared to 2019 levels (OECD/FAO 2019).

Increased fertiliser use has been driven by pursuit of increased crop yields, with for example, a 61% increase in average global cereal yield per hectare observed during the same period (FAO 2021c), achieved through both increased fertiliser use and varietal improvements. Increased yields are in response to increased demand for food, feed, fuel and fibre crops which in turn has been driven by a growing human population (FAO, 2019), increased demand for animal-sourced food and bioenergy policy (OECD/FAO 2019). Global crop production is projected to increase by almost 15% over the next decade, with low income and emerging regions with greater availability of land and labour resources expected to experience the strongest growth, and account for about 50% of global output growth (OECD/FAO 2019).

Estimates reflect sectoral studies based on a comprehensive literature review updating data from (Roe et al. 2019) and integrated assessment models using the IPCC AR6 database (Section 7.5). Values represent the mean, and full range of potential. Sectoral mitigation estimates are averaged for the years 2020–2050 to capture a wider range of literature, and the IAM estimates are given for 2050 as many model assumptions delay most land-based mitigation to mid-century. The sectoral potentials are the sum of global estimates for the individual measures listed for each option. IAM potentials are given for mitigation options with available data; for example, net land-use CO2 for total forests and other ecosystems, and land sequestration from A/R, but not reduced deforestation (protect). Sectoral estimates predominantly use GWP100 IPCC AR5 values (CH4= 28, N2O = 265), although some use GWP100 IPCC AR4 values (CH4= 25, N2O = 298); and the IAMs use GWP100 IPCC AR6 values (CH4= 27, N2O = 273). The sectoral and IAM estimates reflected here do not account for the substitution effects of avoiding fossil fuel emissions nor emissions from other more energy intensive resources/materials. For example, BECCS estimates only consider the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) via geological storage component and not potential mitigation derived from the displacement of fossil fuel use in the energy sector. Mitigation potential from substitution effects are included in the other sectoral chapters like energy, transport, buildings and industry. The total AFOLU sectoral estimate aggregates potential from agriculture, forests and other ecosystems, and diverted agricultural production from avoided food waste and diet shifts (excluding land-use impacts to avoid double counting). Because of potential overlaps between measures, sectoral values from BECCS and the full value chain potential from demand-side measures are not summed with AFOLU. IAMs account for land competition and resource optimisation and can therefore sum across all available categories to derive the total AFOLU potential.

wg3_ch07_7.4.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Two main approaches to estimating mitigation potentials include: (i) studies on individual measures and/or sectors – henceforth referred to as sectoral assessments, and (ii) integrated assessment models (IAM). Sectoral assessments include studies focusing on one activity (e.g., agroforestry) based on spatial and biophysical data, as well as econometric and optimisation models for a sector, for example, the forest or agriculture sector, and therefore cover a large suite of practices and activities while representing a broad body of literature. Sectoral assessments, however, rarely capture cross-sector interactions or impacts, making it difficult to completely account for land competition, trade-offs, and double counting when aggregating sectoral estimates across different studies and methods (Smith et al. 2014; Jia et al. 2019). On the other hand, IAMs assess the climate impact of multiple and interlinked practices across sectors and therefore, can account for interactions and trade-offs (including land competition, use of other resources and international trade) between them. However, the number of land-based measures used in IAMs are limited compared with the sectoral portfolio (Figure 7.11). The resolution of land-based measures in IAMs are also generally coarser compared to some sectoral estimates, and as such, may be less robust for individual measures (Roe et al. 2021). Given the differences between and strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, it is helpful to compare the estimates from both.

It should be noted that the underlying literature for sectoral as well as IAM mitigation estimates consider GWP100 IPCC AR5 values (CH4= 28, N2O = 265) as well as GWP100 IPCC AR4 values (CH4= 25, N2O = 298) to convert CH4 and N2O to CO2-eq. Where possible, we note the various GWP100 values (in IAM estimates, and the wetlands and agriculture sections), however in some instances, the varying GWP100 values used across studies prevents description of non-CO2 gases in native units as well as conversion to AR6 GWP100 (CH4= 27, N2O = 273) CO2-eq values to aggregate sectoral assessment estimates."

Smith et al. 2019), their efficacy and scale of benefit or risk largely depends on the type of activity undertaken, deployment strategy (e.g., scale, method), and context (e.g., soil, biome, climate, food system, land ownership) that vary geographically and over time (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (L.G. Smith et al. 2019; P. Smith et al. 2019 a; Hurlbert et al. 2019) (Section 12.5). Impacts of land-based mitigation measures are therefore highly context specific and conclusions from specific studies may not be universally applicable. If implemented at appropriate scales and in a sustainable manner, land-based mitigation practices have the capacity to reduce emissions and sequester billions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere over coming decades, while also preserving or enhancing biodiversity, water quality and supply, air quality, soil fertility, food and wood security, livelihoods, resilience to droughts, floods and other natural disasters, and positively contributing to ecosystem health and human well-being ( high confidence) (Toensmeier 2016; Karlsson et al. 2020)."

Land-based mitigation may also face limitations and trade-offs in achieving sustained emission reductions and/or removals due to other land challenges including climate change impacts. It is widely recognised that land-use planning that is context-specific, considers other sustainable development goals, and is adaptable over time can help achieve land-based mitigation that maximises co-benefits, avoids or limits trade-offs, and delivers on international policy goals including the SDGs, Land Degradation Neutrality, and Convention on Biological Diversity (Section 7.6; Chapter 12)."

This assessment concludes the likely range of global land-based mitigation potential is approximately 8–14 GtCO2-eq yr –1 between 2020–2050 with carbon prices up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1, about half of the technical potential (medium evidence, medium agreement ). About 30–50% could be achieved <USD20 tCO2-eq –1 (Table 7.3). The global economic potential estimates in this assessment are slightly higher than the AR5 range. Since AR5, there have been numerous new global assessments of sectoral land-based mitigation potential (Fuss et al. 2018; Griscom et al. 2017, 2020; Roe et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2019; Griscom et al. 2020; Roe et al. 2021) as well as IAM estimates of mitigation potential (Riahi et al. 2017; Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Frank et al. 2019; Johnston and Radeloff 2019; Baker et al. 2019), expanding the scope of AFOLU mitigation measures included and substantially improving the robustness and spatial resolution of mitigation estimates. A recent development is an assessment of country-level technical and economic (USD100 tCO2-eq –1) mitigation potential for 20 AFOLU measures, including for demand-side and soil organic carbon sequestration in croplands and grasslands, not estimated before (Roe et al. 2021). Estimates on costs, feasibility, sustainability, benefits, and risks have also been developed for some mitigation measures, and they continue to be active areas of research. Developing more refined sustainable potentials at a country-level will be an important next step. Although most mitigation estimates still do not consider the impact of future climate change, there are some emerging studies that do (Sonntag et al. 2016; Doelman et al. 2019). Given the IPCC WG1 finding that the land sink is continuing to increase although its efficiency is decreasing with climate change, it will be critical to better understand how future climate will affect mitigation potentials, particularly from CDR measures."

Adding 2.1 GtCO2-eq yr –1 from demand-side measures (accounting only for diverted agricultural production to avoid double counting with land-use change effects), total land-based mitigation potential up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1 is 13.6 (6.7–23.4) GtCO2-eq yr –1. This estimate aligns with the most recent regional assessment (Roe et al. 2021), which found the aggregate global mitigation potential of supply and demand-side measures to be 13.8 ± 3.1 GtCO2-eq yr –1 up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1 for the period 2020–2050. Across integrated assessment models (IAMs), the economic potential for land-based mitigation (Agriculture, LULUCF and BECCS) for USD100 tCO2-eq –1 is 7.9 mean (4.1–17.3 range) GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2050 (Table 7.3). We add the estimate for BECCS here to provide the full land-based potential, as IAMs optimise land allocation based on costs, which displaces land-based CDR activities for BECCS. Combining both IAM and sectoral approaches, the likely range is therefore 7.9–13.6 (rounded to 8–14) GtCO2-eq yr –1 up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1 between 2020–2050. Considering both IAM and sectoral economic potential estimates, land-based mitigation could have the capacity to make the AFOLU sector net negative in GHG emissions from 2036 (Figure 7.12), although there are highly variable mitigation strategies for how AFOLU potential can be deployed for achieving climate targets (Illustrative Mitigation Pathways in Section 7.5.5). Economic potential estimates, which reflect a public willingness to pay, may be more relevant for policy making compared with technical potentials which reflect a theoretical maximum that may not be feasible or sustainable."

Agriculture provides the second largest share of mitigation, with 4.1 (1.7–6.7) GtCO2-eq yr –1 potential (up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1), from soil carbon management in croplands and grasslands, agroforestry, biochar, rice cultivation, and livestock and nutrient management (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.11). Demand-side measures including shifting to sustainable healthy diets, reducing food waste, and improving wood products can mitigate 2.2 (1.1–3.6) GtCO2-eq yr –1 when accounting only for diverted agricultural production from diets and food waste to avoid double counting with measures in forests and other ecosystems (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.11). The potential of demand-side measures increases three-fold, to 6.5 (4–9.5) GtCO2-eq yr –1 when accounting for the entire value chain including land-use effects, but would overlap with other measures and is therefore not additive."
wg3_ch07_7.4.1.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR need upfront investment to generate sequestration over time. The protection of natural ecosystems, carbon sequestration in agriculture, sustainable healthy diets and reduced food waste have especially high co-benefits and cost efficiency. Avoiding the conversion of carbon-rich primary peatlands, coastal wetlands and forests is particularly important as most carbon lost from those ecosystems are irrecoverable through restoration by the 2050 timeline of achieving net zero carbon emissions (Goldstein et al. 2020). Sustainable intensification, shifting diets, reducing food waste could enhance efficiencies and reduce agricultural land needs, and are therefore critical for enabling supply-side measures such as reduced deforestation, restoration, as well as reducing N2O and CH4 emissions from agricultural production – as seen in the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway (IMP-SP) (Section 7.5.6). Although agriculture measures that reduce non-CO2, particularly of CH4, are important for near-term emissions reductions, they have less economic potential due to costs. Demand-side measures may be able to deliver non-CO2 emissions reductions more cost efficiently."
wg3_ch07_7.4.1.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Regionally, economic mitigation potential up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1 is estimated to be greatest in tropical countries in Asia and Pacific (34%), Latin America and the Caribbean (24%), and Africa and the Middle East (18%) because of the large potential from reducing deforestation and sequestering carbon in forests and agriculture (Figure 7.11). However, there is also considerable potential in Developed Countries (18%) and more modest potential in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia (5%). These results are in line with the IAM regional mitigation potentials (Figure 7.11). The protection of forests and other ecosystems is the dominant source of mitigation potential in tropical regions, whereas carbon sequestration in agricultural land and demand-side measures are important in Developed Countries and Asia and Pacific. The restoration and management of forests and other ecosystems is more geographically distributed, with all regions having significant potential. Regions with large livestock herds (Developed Countries, Latin America) and rice paddy fields (Asia and Pacific) have potential to reduce CH4. As expected, the highest total potential is associated with countries and regions with large land areas, however when considering mitigation density (total potential per hectare), many smaller countries, particularly those with wetlands have disproportionately high levels of mitigation for their size (Roe et al. 2021). As global commodity markets connect regions, AFOLU measures may create synergies and trade-offs across the world, which could make national demand-side measures for example, important in mitigating supply-side emissions elsewhere (Kallio et al. 2018)."

The feasibility of implementing AFOLU mitigation measures, including those with multiple co-benefits, depends on varying economic, technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental and geophysical barriers ( high confidence) (L.G.

Protecting forests involves controlling the drivers of deforestation (such as commercial and subsistence agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and forest degradation (such as overharvesting including fuelwood collection, poor harvesting practices, overgrazing, pest outbreaks, and extreme wildfires), as well as by establishing well designed, managed and funded protected areas (Barber et al. 2014), improving law enforcement, forest governance and land tenure, supporting community forest management and introducing forest certification (P. Smith et al. 2019 a). Reducing deforestation provides numerous and substantial co-benefits, preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., air and water filtration, water cycling, nutrient cycling) more effectively and at lower costs than afforestation/reforestation (Jia et al. 2019). Potential adverse side effects of these conservation measures include reducing the potential for agriculture land expansion, restricting the rights and access of local people to forest resources, or increasing the dependence of local people to insecure external funding. Barriers to implementation include unclear land tenure, weak environmental governance, insufficient funds, and increasing pressures associated to agriculture conversion, resource exploitation and infrastructure development (Sections 7.3 and 7.6)."

The higher technical estimate represents a complete halting of land-use conversion in forests and peatland forests (i.e., assuming recent rates of carbon loss are saved each year) and includes vegetation and soil carbon pools. Ranges of economic potentials for forestry ranged in AR5 from 0.01–1.45 GtCO2 yr –1 for USD20 tCO2–1 to 0.2–13.8 GtCO2 yr –1 for USD100 tCO2–1 by 2030 with reduced deforestation dominating the forestry mitigation potential LAM and MAF, but very little potential in OECD-1990 and EIT (IPCC AR5)."

Since the SRCCL, several studies have provided updated and convergent estimates of economic mitigation potentials by region (Busch et al. 2019; Griscom et al. 2020; Austin et al. 2020; Roe et al. 2021). Tropical forests and savannas in Latin America provide the largest share of mitigation potential (3.9 GtCO2 yr –1 technical, 2.5 GtCO2 yr –1 at USD100 tCO2–1) followed by South-East Asia (2.2 GtCO2 yr –1 technical, 1.5 GtCO2 yr –1 at USD100 tCO2–1) and Africa (2.2 GtCO2 yr –1 technical, 1.2 GtCO2 yr –1 at USD100 tCO2–1) (Roe et al. 2021). Tropical forests continue to account for the highest rates of deforestation and associated GHG emissions. While deforestation shows signs of decreasing in several countries, in others, it continues at a high rate or is increasing (Turubanova et al. 2018). Between 2010–2020, the rate of net forest loss was 4.7 Mha yr –1 with Africa and South America presenting the largest shares (3.9 Mha and 2.6 Mha, respectively) (FAO 2020a)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"A major uncertainty in all studies on avoided deforestation potential is their reliance on future reference levels that vary across studies and approaches. If food demand increases in the future, for example, the area of land deforested will likely increase, suggesting more technical potential for avoiding deforestation. Transboundary leakage due to market adjustments could also increase costs or reduce effectiveness of avoiding deforestation (e.g., Ingalls et al. 2018; Gingrich et al. 2019). Regarding forest regrowth, there are uncertainties about the time for the secondary forest carbon saturation (Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Zhu et al. 2018). Permanence of avoided deforestation may also be a concern due to the impacts of climate change and disturbance of other biogeochemical cycles on the world’s forests that can result in future potential changes in terrestrial ecosystem productivity, climate-driven vegetation migration, wildfires, forest regrowth and carbon dynamics (Ballantyne et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2017b; Lovejoy and Nobre 2018; Aragão et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Critical assessment and conclusion. Based on studies since AR5, the technical mitigation potential for reducing deforestation and degradation is significant, providing 4.5 (2.3–7) GtCO2 yr –1 globally by 2050, of which 3.4 (2.3–6.4) GtCO2 yr –1 is available at below USD100 tCO2–1 (medium confidence) (Figure 7.11). Over the last decade, hundreds of subnational initiatives that aim to reduce deforestation related emissions have been implemented across the tropics (Section 7.6). Reduced deforestation is a significant piece of the NDCs in the Paris Agreement (Seddon et al. 2020) and keeping the temperature below 1.5°C (Crusius 2020). Conservation of forests provides multiple co-benefits linked to ecosystem services, biodiversity and sustainable development (Section 7.6.). Still, ensuring good governance, accountability (e.g., enhanced monitoring and verification capacity; Bos 2020), and the rule of law are crucial for implementing forest-based mitigation options. In many countries with the highest deforestation rates, insecure land rights often are significant barriers for forest-based mitigation options (Gren and Zeleke 2016; Essl et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Afforestation and reforestation (A/R) are activities that convert land to forest, where reforestation is on land that has previously contained forests, while afforestation is on land that historically has not been forested (Box 7.2). Forest restoration refers to a form of reforestation that gives more priority to ecological integrity as well, even though it can still be a managed forest. Depending on the location, scale, and choice and management of tree species, A/R activities have a wide variety of co-benefits and trade-offs. Well-planned, sustainable reforestation and forest restoration can enhance climate resilience and biodiversity, and provide a variety of ecosystem services including water regulation, microclimatic regulation, soil erosion protection, as well as renewable resources, income and livelihoods (Locatelli et al. 2015; Stanturf et al. 2015; Ellison et al. 2017; Verkerk et al. 2020). Afforestation, when well planned, can help address land degradation and desertification by reducing runoff and erosion and lead to cloud formation however, when not well planned, there are localised trade-offs such as reduced water yield or biodiversity (Teuling et al. 2017; Ellison et al. 2017). The use of non-native species and monocultures may have adverse impacts on ecosystem structure and function, and water availability, particularly in dry regions (Ellison et al. 2017). A/R activities may change the surface albedo and evapotranspiration regimes, producing net cooling in the tropical and subtropical latitudes for local and global climate and net warming at high latitudes (Section 7.4.2). Very large-scale implementation of A/R may negatively affect food security since an increase in global forest area can increase food prices through land competition (Kreidenweis et al. 2016)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 did not provide a new specification of A/R potential, but referred to IPCC AR4 mostly for forestry measures (Nabuurs et al. 2007). The AR5 did view the feasible A/R potential from a diets change scenario that released land for reforestation and bioenergy crops. The AR5 provided top-down estimates of costs and potentials for forestry mitigation options – including reduced deforestation, forest management, afforestation, and agroforestry, estimated to contribute between 1.27 and 4.23 GtCO2 yr –1 of economically viable abatement in 2030 at carbon prices up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1 (Smith et al. 2014)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The SRCCL remained with a reported wide range of mitigation potential for A/R of 0.5–10.1 GtCO2 yr –1 by 2050 (medium confidence) (Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Fuss et al. 2018; Roe et al. 2019) (SRCCL Chapters 2 and 6). The higher estimate represents a technical potential of reforesting all areas where forests are the native cover type (reforestation), constrained by food security and biodiversity considerations, considering above and below-ground carbon pools and implementation on a rather theoretical maximum of 678 Mha of land (Griscom et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019). The lower estimates represent the minimum range from an Earth System Model and a sustainable global CDR potential (Fuss et al. 2018). Climate change will affect the mitigation potential of reforestation due to impacts in forest growth and composition, as well as changes in disturbances including fire. However, none of the mitigation estimates included in the SRCCL account for climate impacts."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL).  Since SRCCL, additional studies have been published on A/R mitigation potential by Bastin et al. (2019), Lewis et al. (2019), Doelman et al. (2019), Favero et al. (2020) and Austin et al. (2020). These studies are within the range reported in the SRCCL stretching the potentials at the higher range. The rising public interest in nature-based solutions, along with high profile initiatives being launched (UN Decade on Restoration announced in 2019, the Bonn challenge on 150 million ha of restored forest in 2020 and the one trillion trees campaign launched by the World Economic Forum in 2020), has prompted intense discussions on the scale, effectiveness, and pitfalls of A/R and tree planting for climate mitigation (Luyssaert et al. 2018; Bond et al. 2019; Anderegg et al. 2020; Heilmayr et al. 2020; Holl and Brancalion 2020). The sometimes sole attention on afforestation and reforestation – suggesting it may solve the climate problem to large extent, in combination with the very high estimates of potentials – have led to polarisation in the debate, resulting in criticism to these measures or an emphasis on nature restoration only (Lewis et al. 2019). Our assessment based on most recent literature produced regional economic mitigation potential at USD100 tCO2–1 estimate of 100–400 MtCO2 yr –1 in Africa, 210–266 MtCO2 yr –1 in Asia and Pacific, 291 MtCO2-eq yr –1 in Developed Countries (87% in North America), 30 MtCO2-eq yr –1 in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, and 345–898 MtCO2-eq yr –1 in Latin America and Caribbean (Roe et al. 2021), which totals to about 1200 MtCO2 yr –1, leaning to the lower range of the potentials in earlier IPCC reports. A recent global assessment of the aggregate costs for afforestation and reforestation suggests that at USD100 tCO2–1, 1.6 GtCO2 yr –1 could be sequestered globally for an annual cost of USD130 billion (Austin et al. 2020). Sectoral studies that are able to deal with local circumstances and limits estimate A/R potentials at 20 MtCO2 yr –1 in Russia (Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia) (Romanovskaya et al. 2020) and 64 MtCO2 yr –1 in Europe (Nabuurs et al. 2017). (Domke et al. 2020) estimated for the USA an additional 20% sequestration rate from tree planting to achieve full stocking capacity of all understocked productive forestland, in total reaching 187 MtCO2 yr –1 sequestration. A new study on costs in the USA estimates 72–91 MtCO2 yr –1 could be sequestered between now and 2050 for USD100 tCO2–1 (Wade et al. 2019). The tropical and subtropical latitudes are the most effective for forest restoration in terms of carbon sequestration because of the rapid growth and lower albedo of the land surface compared with high latitudes (Lewis et al. 2019). Costs may be higher if albedo is considered in North America, Russia, and Africa (Favero et al. 2017). In addition, a wide variety of sequestration rates have been collected and published in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for the AFOLU sector (IPCC 2006)."

There is medium confidence that the global technical mitigation potential of afforestation and reforestation activities by 2050 is 3.9 (0.5–10.1) GtCO2 yr –1, and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO2–1) is 1.6 (0.5–3.0) GtCO2 yr –1 (requiring about 200 Mha). Per hectare a long (about 100 year) sustained effect of 5–10 t CO2 ha –1 yr –1 is realistic with ranges between 1–20 t(CO2) ha –1 yr –1. Not all sectoral studies rely on economic models that account for leakage (Murray et al. 2004; Sohngen and Brown 2004), suggesting that technical potential may be overestimated."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Improved sustainable forest management of already managed forests can lead to higher forest carbon stocks, better quality of produced wood, continuously produced wood, while maintaining and enhancing the forest carbon stock, and can also partially prevent and counteract the impacts of disturbances (Kurz et al. 2008; Marlon et al. 2012; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Seidl et al. 2017; Nabuurs et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2018; Ekholm 2020). Furthermore, it can provide benefits for climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, microclimatic regulation, soil erosion protection and water and flood regulation with reduced lateral carbon fluxes (Ashton et al. 2012; Martínez-Mena et al. 2019; Verkerk et al. 2020). Often, in existing (managed) forests with existing carbon stocks, large changes per hectare cannot be expected, although many forest owners may respond to carbon price incentives (Favero et al. 2020; Ekholm 2020). The full mitigation effects can be assessed in conjunction with the overall forest and wood use system i.e., carbon stock changes in standing trees, soil, harvested wood products (HWPs) and its bioenergy component with the avoided emissions through substitution. Forest management strategies aimed at increasing the biomass stock may have adverse side effects, such as decreasing the stand-level structural complexity, large emphasis on pure fast-growing stands, risks for biodiversity and resilience to natural disasters."

Further, there is a trade-off between management in various parts of the forest product value chain, resulting in a wide range of results on the role of managed forests in mitigation (Agostini et al. 2013; Braun et al. 2016; Soimakallio et al. 2016; Gustavsson et al. 2017; Erb et al. 2017; Favero et al. 2020; Hurmekoski et al. 2020). Some studies conclude that reduction in forest carbon stocks due to harvest exceeds for decades the joint sequestration of carbon in harvested wood product stocks and emissions avoided through wood use (Soimakallio et al. 2016; Seppälä et al. 2019), whereas others emphasise country level examples where investments in forest management have led to higher growing stocks while producing more wood (Schulze et al. 2020; Ouden et al. 2020; Cowie et al. 2021)."

The higher estimate stems from assumptions of applications on roughly 1.9 billion ha of already managed forest which can be seen as very optimistic.

This all depends on the effort made, the development of expertise, know-how in the field, nurseries with adapted provenances, etc as was also found for Russian climate-smart forestry options (Leskinen et al. 2020).

In one production region (British Columbia) a cost-effective portfolio of scenarios was simulated that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of –9 MtCO2-eq yr –1 (Smyth et al. 2020).

Selective logging occurs in at least 20% of the world’s tropical forests and causes at least half of the emissions from tropical forest degradation (Asner et al. 2005; Blaser and Küchli 2011; Pearson et al. 2017).

Efforts to change forest management do not only require, for example, a carbon price incentive, but especially require knowledge, institutions, skilled labour, good access and so on. These requirements outline that although the potential is of medium size, we estimate a feasible potential towards the lower end. The net effect is also difficult to assess, as management changes impact not only the forest biomass, but also the wood chain and substitution effects. Further, leakage can arise from efforts to change management for carbon sequestration. Efforts, for example to set aside large areas of forest, may be partly counteracted by higher harvesting pressures elsewhere (Kallio et al. 2018). Studies such as (Austin et al. 2020) implicitly account for leakage and thus suggest higher costs than other studies.

Grasslands cover approximately 40.5% of the terrestrial area (i.e., 52.5 million km 2) divided as 13.8% woody savanna and savanna; 12.7% open and closed shrub; 8.3% non-woody grassland; and 5.7% is tundra (White et al. 2000). Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia have the most extensive total area, 14.5 and 8.9 million km 2, respectively. A review by Conant et al.

Reducing the conversion of grasslands and savannas to croplands prevents soil carbon losses by oxidation, and to a smaller extent, biomass carbon loss due to vegetation clearing (SRCCL, Chapter 6). Restoration of grasslands through enhanced soil carbon sequestration, including (i) management of vegetation, (ii) animal management, and (iii) fire management, was also included in the SRCCL and is covered in Section 7.4.3.1. Similar to other measures that reduce conversion, conserving carbon stocks in grasslands and savannas can be achieved by controlling conversion drivers (e.g., commercial and subsistence agriculture, see Section 7.3) and improving policies and management. In addition to mitigation, conserving grasslands provide various socio-economic, biodiversity, water cycle and other environmental benefits (Claassen et al. 2010; Ryals et al. 2015; Bengtsson et al. 2019).

The SRCCL reported a mitigation potential for reduced conversion of grasslands and savannas of 0.03–0.12 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Griscom et al. 2017; IPCC 2019) considering the higher loss of soil organic carbon in croplands (Sanderman et al. 2017). Assuming an average starting soil organic carbon stock of temperate grasslands (Poeplau et al. 2011), and the mean annual global cropland conversion rates (1961–2003) (Krause et al. 2017), the equivalent loss of soil organic carbon over 20 years would be 14 GtCO2-eq, for example, 0.7 GtCO2 yr –1 (SRCCL, Chapter 6). IPCC AR5 and AR4 did not explicitly consider the mitigation potential of avoided conversion of grasslands-savannas but the management of grazing land is accounted for considering plant, animal, and fire management with a mean mitigation potential of 0.11–0.80 tCO2-eq ha –1 yr –1 depending on the climate region. This resulted in 0.25 GtCO2-eq yr –1 at USD20 tCO2–1 to 1.25 GtCO2-eq yr –1 at USD100 tCO2–1 by 2030."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL). Unlike most of the measures covered in Section 7.4, there are currently no global, spatially explicit mitigation potential estimates for reduced grassland conversion to generate technical and economic potentials by region. Literature developments since AR5 and SRCCL are studies that provide mitigation estimates in one or a few countries or regions. Modelling experiments comparing Californian forests and grasslands found that grasslands resulted in a more resilient carbon sink than forests to future climate change (Dass et al. 2018). However, previous studies indicated that precipitation is a key controller of the carbon storage in these grasslands, with the grassland became a carbon sink in 2005, when the region received relatively high spring precipitation (Ma et al. 2007). In North America, grassland conversion was the source for 77% of all new croplands from 2008–2012 (Lark et al. 2015). Avoided conversion of North American grasslands to croplands presents an economic mitigation potential of 0.024 GtCO2-eq yr –1 and technical potential of 0.107 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Fargione et al. 2018). This potential is related mainly to root biomass and soils (81% of emissions from soils). Estimates of GHG emissions from any future deforestation in Australian savannas also point to the potential mitigation of around 0.024 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Bristow et al. 2016). The expansion of the Soy Moratorium (SoyM) from the Brazilian Amazon to the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) would prevent the direct conversion of 3.6 Mha of native vegetation to soybeans by 2050 and avoid the emission of 0.02 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Soterroni et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Critical assessment and conclusion. There is low confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for reduced grassland and savanna conversion by 2050 is 0.2 (0.1–0.4) GtCO2 yr –1, and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO2–1) is 0.04 GtCO2 yr –1. Most of the carbon sequestration potential is in below-ground biomass and soil organic matter. However, estimates of potential are still based on few studies and vary according to the levels of soil carbon, and ecosystem productivity (e.g., in response to rainfall distribution). Conservation of grasslands presents significant benefits for desertification control, especially in arid areas (SRCCL, Chapter 3). Policies supporting avoided conversion can help protect at-risk grasslands, reduce GHG emissions, and produce positive outcomes for biodiversity and landowners (Ahlering et al. 2016). In comparison to tropical rainforest regions that have been the primary target for mitigation policies associated to natural ecosystems (e.g., REDD+), conversion grasslands and savannas has received less national and international attention, despite growing evidence of concentrated cropland expansion into these areas with impacts of carbon losses."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Peatlands are carbon-rich wetland ecosystems with organic soil horizons in which soil organic matter concentration exceeds 30% (dry weight) and soil carbon concentrations can exceed 50% (Page and Baird 2016, Boone Kauffman et al. 2017). Reducing the conversion of peatlands avoids emissions of above- and below-ground biomass and soil carbon due to vegetation clearing, fires, and peat decomposition from drainage. Similar to deforestation, peatland carbon stocks can be conserved by controlling the drivers of conversion and degradation (e.g., commercial and subsistence agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and improving governance and management. Reducing conversion is urgent because peatland carbon stocks accumulate slowly and persist over millennia; loss of existing stocks cannot be easily reversed over the decadal time scales needed to meet the Paris Agreement (Goldstein et al. 2020). The main co-benefits of reducing conversion of peatlands include conservation of a unique biodiversity including many critically endangered species, provision of water quality and regulation, and improved public health through decreased fire-caused pollutants (Griscom et al. 2017). Although reducing peatland conversion will reduce land availability for alternative uses including agriculture or other land-based mitigation, drained peatlands constitute a small share of agricultural land globally while contributing significant emissions (Joosten 2009). Mitigation through reduced conversion of peatlands therefore has a high potential of avoided emissions per hectare (Roe et al. 2019)."

In the SRCCL (Chapters 2 and 6), it was estimated that avoided peat impacts could deliver 0.45–1.22 GtCO2-eq yr –1 technical potential by 2030–2050 (medium confidence) (Hooijer et al. 2010; Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017). The mitigation potential estimates cover tropical peatlands and include CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions. The mitigation potential is derived from quantification of losses of carbon stocks due to land conversion, shifts in GHG fluxes, alterations in net ecosystem productivity, input factors such as fertilisation needs, and biophysical climate impacts (e.g., shifts in albedo, water cycles, etc.). Tropical peatlands account for only about 10% of peatland area and about 20% of peatland carbon stock but about 80% of peatland carbon emissions, primarily from peatland conversion in Indonesia (about 60%) and Malaysia (about 10%) (Hooijer et al. 2010; Page et al. 2011; Leifeld and Menichetti 2018).

Recent studies continue to report high carbon stocks in peatlands and emphasise the vulnerability of peatland carbon after conversion. The carbon stocks of tropical peatlands are among the highest of any forest, 1,211–4,257 tCO2-eq ha –1 in the Peruvian Amazon (Bhomia et al. 2019) and 1,956–14,757 tCO2-eq ha –1 in Indonesia (Novita et al. 2021). Ninety percent of tropical peatland carbon stocks are vulnerable to emission during conversion and may not be recoverable through restoration; in contrast, boreal and temperate peatlands hold similar carbon stocks (1,439–5,619 tCO2-eq ha –1) but only 30% of northern carbon stocks are vulnerable to emission during conversion and irrecoverable through restoration (Goldstein et al. 2020). A recent study shows global mitigation potential of about 0.2 GtCO2-eq yr –1 at costs up to USD100 tCO2–1 (Roe et al. 2021). Another study estimated that 72% of mitigation is achieved through avoided soil carbon impacts, with the remainder through avoided impacts to vegetation (Bossio et al. 2020). Recent model projections show that both peatland protection and peatland restoration (Section 7.4.2.7) are needed to achieve a 2°C mitigation pathway and that peatland protection and restoration policies will have minimal impacts on regional food security (Leifeld et al. 2019, Humpenöder et al. 2020). Global studies have not accounted for extensive peatlands recently reported in the Congo Basin, estimated to cover 145,500 km 2 and contain 30.6 PgC, as much as 29% of total tropical peat carbon stock (Dargie et al. 2017). These Congo peatlands are relatively intact; continued preservation is needed to prevent major emissions (Dargie et al. 2019). In northern peatlands that are underlain by permafrost roughly 50% of the total peatlands north of 23° latitude, (Hugelius et al. 2020), climate change (i.e., warming) is the major driver of peatland degradation (e.g., through permafrost thaw) (Schuur et al. 2015, Goldstein et al. 2020). However, in non-permafrost boreal and temperate peatlands, reduction of peatland conversion is also a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Peatlands are sensitive to climate change and there is low confidence about the future peatland sink globally (SRCCL, Chapter 2). Permafrost thaw may shift northern peatlands from a net carbon sink to net source (Hugelius et al. 2020). Uncertainties in peatland extent and the magnitude of existing carbon stocks, in both northern (Loisel et al. 2014) and tropical (Dargie et al. 2017) latitudes limit understanding of current and future peatland carbon dynamics (Minasny et al. 2019)."

High per hectare mitigation potential and high rate of co-benefits particularly in tropical countries, support the effectiveness of this mitigation strategy (Roe et al. 2019).

wg3_ch07_7.4.2.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded and damaged peatlands, for example through rewetting and revegetation, which both increases carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils and avoids ongoing CO2 emissions. Peatlands only account for about 3% of the terrestrial surface, predominantly occurring in boreal ecosystems (78%), with a smaller proportion in tropical regions (13%), but may store about 600 GtC or 21% of the global total soil organic carbon stock of about 3000 Gt (Page et al. 2011; Leifeld and Menichetti 2018). Peatland restoration delivers co-benefits for biodiversity, as well as regulating water flow and preventing downstream flooding, while still allowing for extensive management such as paludiculture (Tan et al. 2021). Rewetting of peatlands also reduces the risk of fire, but may also mobilise salts and contaminants in soils (van Diggelen et al. 2020) and in severely degraded peatlands, restoration of peatland hydrology and vegetation may not be feasible (Andersen et al. 2017). At a local level, restoration of peatlands drained for agriculture could displace food production and damage local food supply, although impacts to regional and global food security would be minimal (Humpenöder et al. 2020). Collaborative and transparent planning processes are needed to reduce conflict between competing land uses (Tanneberger et al. 2020b). Adequate resources for implementing restoration policies are key to engage local communities and maintain livelihoods (Resosudarmo et al. 2019; Ward et al. 2021)."

Although rewetting of drained peatlands increases CH4 emissions, this effect is often outweighed by decreases in CO2 and N2O emissions but depends very much on local circumstances (Günther et al. 2020). Restoration and rewetting of almost all drained peatlands is needed by 2050 to meet 1.5°C–2°C pathways which is unlikely to happen (Leifeld et al. 2019); immediate rewetting and restoration minimises the warming from cumulative CO2 emissions (Nugent et al. 2019)."

Reducing conversion of coastal wetlands, including mangroves, marshes and seagrass ecosystems, avoids emissions from above and below ground biomass and soil carbon through avoided degradation and/or loss. Coastal wetlands occur mainly in estuaries and deltas, areas that are often densely settled, with livelihoods closely linked to coastal ecosystems and resources (Moser et al. 2012). The carbon stocks of these highly productive ecosystems are sometimes referred to as ‘blue carbon’. Loss of existing stocks cannot be easily reversed over decadal time scales (Goldstein et al. 2020). The main drivers of conversion include intensive aquaculture, agriculture, salt ponds, urbanisation and infrastructure development, the extensive use of fertilisers, and extraction of water resources (Lovelock et al. 2018). Reduced conversion of coastal wetlands has many co-benefits, including biodiversity conservation, fisheries production, soil stabilisation, water flow and water quality regulation, flooding and storm surge prevention, and increased resilience to cyclones (Windham-Myers et al. 2018 a; UNEP 2020). Risks associated with the mitigation potential of coastal wetland conservation include uncertain permanence under future climate scenarios, including the effects of coastal squeeze, where coastal wetland area may be lost if upland area is not available for migration as sea levels rise (Lovelock and Reef 2020) (AR6 WGII, Section 3.4.2.5). Preservation of coastal wetlands also conflicts with other land use in the coastal zone, including aquaculture, agriculture, and human development; economic incentives are needed to prioritise wetland preservation over more profitable short-term land use. Integration of policies and efforts aimed at coastal climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and fisheries, for example through integrated coastal zone management and marine spatial planning, will bundle climate mitigation with co-benefits and optimise outcomes (Herr et al. 2017)."

Coastal wetlands contain high, yet variable, organic carbon stocks, leading to a range of estimates of the global mitigation potential of reduced conversion. The SRCCL (Chapter 2) and SROCC (Chapter 5), report a technical mitigation potential of 0.15–5.35 GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2050 (Pendleton et al. 2012; Lovelock et al. 2017; Howard et al. 2017; Griscom et al. 2017). The mitigation potential is derived from quantification of losses of carbon stocks in vegetation and soil due to land conversion, shifts in GHG fluxes associated with land use, and alterations in net ecosystem productivity. The wide range in estimates mostly relate to the scope (all coastal ecosystems vs mangroves only) and different assumptions on decomposition rates. Loss rates of coastal wetlands have been estimated at 0.2–3% yr –1, depending on the vegetation type and location (Atwood et al. 2017; Howard et al. 2017)."

wg3_ch07_7.4.2.9_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded or damaged coastal wetlands including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass ecosystems, leading to sequestration of ‘blue carbon’ in wetland vegetation and soil (SRCCL, Chapter 6; SROCC, Chapter 5). Successful approaches to wetland restoration include: (i) passive restoration, the removal of anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation or preventing recovery; and (ii) active restoration, purposeful manipulations to the environment in order to achieve recovery to a naturally functioning system (Elliott et al. 2016) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 3). Restoration of coastal wetlands delivers many valuable co-benefits, including enhanced water quality, biodiversity, aesthetic values, fisheries production (food security), and protection from rising sea levels and storm impacts (Barbier et al. 2011; Hochard et al. 2019; Sun and Carson 2020; Duarte et al. 2020). Of the 0.3 Mkm 2 coastal wetlands globally, 0.11 Mkm 2 of mangroves are considered feasible for restoration (Griscom et al. 2017). Risks associated with coastal wetland restoration include uncertain permanence under future climate scenarios (IPCC AR6 WGII, Box 3.4), partial offsets of mitigation through enhanced methane and nitrous oxide release and carbonate formation, and competition with other land uses, including aquaculture and human settlement and development in the coastal zone (SROCC, Chapter 5). To date, many coastal wetland restoration efforts do not succeed due to failure to address the drivers of degradation (van Katwijk et al. 2016). However, improved frameworks for implementing and assessing coastal wetland restoration are emerging that emphasise the recovery of ecosystem functions (Zhao et al. 2016; Cadier et al. 2020). Restoration projects that involve local communities at all stages and consider both biophysical and socio-political context are more likely to succeed (Brown et al. 2014; Wylie et al. 2016)."

Recent studies emphasise the time frame needed to achieve the full mitigation potential (Duarte et al. 2020; Taillardat et al. 2020). The first project-derived estimate of the net GHG benefit from seagrass restoration found 1.54 tCO2-eq (0.42 MgC) ha –1 yr –110 years after restoration began (Oreska et al. 2020); comparable to the default emission factor in the Wetlands Supplement (Kennedy et al. 2014). Recent studies of rehabilitated mangroves also indicate that annual carbon sequestration rates in biomass and soils can return to natural levels within decades of restoration (Cameron et al. 2019; Sidik et al. 2019). A meta-analysis shows increasing carbon sequestration rates over the first 15 years of mangrove restoration with rates stabilising at 25.7 ± 7.7 tCO2-eq (7.0 ± 2.1 MgC) ha –1 yr –1 through forty years, although success depends on climate, sediment type, and restoration methods (Sasmito et al. 2019). Overall, 30% of mangrove soil carbon stocks and 50–70% of marsh and seagrass carbon stocks are unlikely to recover within 30 years of restoration, underscoring the importance of preventing conversion of coastal wetlands (Goldstein et al. 2020) (Section 7.4.2.8)."

Although global potential is relatively moderate, mitigation can be quite significant for countries with extensive coastlines (e.g., Indonesia, Brazil) and for small island states where coastal wetlands have been shown to comprise 24–34% of their total national carbon stock (Donato et al. 2012). Furthermore, non-climatic co-benefits can strongly motivate coastal wetland restoration worldwide (UNEP 2021a). Major successes in both active and passive restoration of seagrasses have been documented in North America and Europe (Lefcheck et al. 2018; de los Santos et al. 2019 ; Orth et al. 2020); passive restoration may also be feasible for mangroves (Cameron et al. 2019)."

Fire management is still challenging because it is not only fire suppression at times of fire, but especially proper natural resource management in between fire events.

Grasslands cover approximately 40.5% of the terrestrial area (i.e., 52.5 million km 2) divided as 13.8% woody savanna and savanna; 12.7% open and closed shrub; 8.3% non-woody grassland; and 5.7% is tundra (White et al. 2000). Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia have the most extensive total area, 14.5 and 8.9 million km 2, respectively. A review by Conant et al.

Reducing the conversion of grasslands and savannas to croplands prevents soil carbon losses by oxidation, and to a smaller extent, biomass carbon loss due to vegetation clearing (SRCCL, Chapter 6). Restoration of grasslands through enhanced soil carbon sequestration, including (i) management of vegetation, (ii) animal management, and (iii) fire management, was also included in the SRCCL and is covered in Section 7.4.3.1. Similar to other measures that reduce conversion, conserving carbon stocks in grasslands and savannas can be achieved by controlling conversion drivers (e.g., commercial and subsistence agriculture, see Section 7.3) and improving policies and management. In addition to mitigation, conserving grasslands provide various socio-economic, biodiversity, water cycle and other environmental benefits (Claassen et al. 2010; Ryals et al. 2015; Bengtsson et al. 2019).

The SRCCL reported a mitigation potential for reduced conversion of grasslands and savannas of 0.03–0.12 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Griscom et al. 2017; IPCC 2019) considering the higher loss of soil organic carbon in croplands (Sanderman et al. 2017). Assuming an average starting soil organic carbon stock of temperate grasslands (Poeplau et al. 2011), and the mean annual global cropland conversion rates (1961–2003) (Krause et al. 2017), the equivalent loss of soil organic carbon over 20 years would be 14 GtCO2-eq, for example, 0.7 GtCO2 yr –1 (SRCCL, Chapter 6). IPCC AR5 and AR4 did not explicitly consider the mitigation potential of avoided conversion of grasslands-savannas but the management of grazing land is accounted for considering plant, animal, and fire management with a mean mitigation potential of 0.11–0.80 tCO2-eq ha –1 yr –1 depending on the climate region.

Unlike most of the measures covered in Section 7.4, there are currently no global, spatially explicit mitigation potential estimates for reduced grassland conversion to generate technical and economic potentials by region. Literature developments since AR5 and SRCCL are studies that provide mitigation estimates in one or a few countries or regions. Modelling experiments comparing Californian forests and grasslands found that grasslands resulted in a more resilient carbon sink than forests to future climate change (Dass et al. 2018). However, previous studies indicated that precipitation is a key controller of the carbon storage in these grasslands, with the grassland became a carbon sink in 2005, when the region received relatively high spring precipitation (Ma et al. 2007). In North America, grassland conversion was the source for 77% of all new croplands from 2008–2012 (Lark et al. 2015). Avoided conversion of North American grasslands to croplands presents an economic mitigation potential of 0.024 GtCO2-eq yr –1 and technical potential of 0.107 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Fargione et al. 2018). This potential is related mainly to root biomass and soils (81% of emissions from soils). Estimates of GHG emissions from any future deforestation in Australian savannas also point to the potential mitigation of around 0.024 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Bristow et al. 2016). The expansion of the Soy Moratorium (SoyM) from the Brazilian Amazon to the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) would prevent the direct conversion of 3.6 Mha of native vegetation to soybeans by 2050 and avoid the emission of 0.02 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Soterroni et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Critical assessment and conclusion. There is low confidence that the global technical mitigation potential for reduced grassland and savanna conversion by 2050 is 0.2 (0.1–0.4) GtCO2 yr –1, and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO2–1) is 0.04 GtCO2 yr –1. Most of the carbon sequestration potential is in below-ground biomass and soil organic matter. However, estimates of potential are still based on few studies and vary according to the levels of soil carbon, and ecosystem productivity (e.g., in response to rainfall distribution). Conservation of grasslands presents significant benefits for desertification control, especially in arid areas (SRCCL, Chapter 3). Policies supporting avoided conversion can help protect at-risk grasslands, reduce GHG emissions, and produce positive outcomes for biodiversity and landowners (Ahlering et al. 2016). In comparison to tropical rainforest regions that have been the primary target for mitigation policies associated to natural ecosystems (e.g., REDD+), conversion grasslands and savannas has received less national and international attention, despite growing evidence of concentrated cropland expansion into these areas with impacts of carbon losses."
wg3_ch07_7.4.2.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Peatlands are carbon-rich wetland ecosystems with organic soil horizons in which soil organic matter concentration exceeds 30% (dry weight) and soil carbon concentrations can exceed 50% (Page and Baird 2016, Boone Kauffman et al. 2017). Reducing the conversion of peatlands avoids emissions of above- and below-ground biomass and soil carbon due to vegetation clearing, fires, and peat decomposition from drainage. Similar to deforestation, peatland carbon stocks can be conserved by controlling the drivers of conversion and degradation (e.g., commercial and subsistence agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and improving governance and management. Reducing conversion is urgent because peatland carbon stocks accumulate slowly and persist over millennia; loss of existing stocks cannot be easily reversed over the decadal time scales needed to meet the Paris Agreement (Goldstein et al. 2020). The main co-benefits of reducing conversion of peatlands include conservation of a unique biodiversity including many critically endangered species, provision of water quality and regulation, and improved public health through decreased fire-caused pollutants (Griscom et al. 2017). Although reducing peatland conversion will reduce land availability for alternative uses including agriculture or other land-based mitigation, drained peatlands constitute a small share of agricultural land globally while contributing significant emissions (Joosten 2009). Mitigation through reduced conversion of peatlands therefore has a high potential of avoided emissions per hectare (Roe et al. 2019)."

The mitigation potential estimates cover tropical peatlands and include CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions. The mitigation potential is derived from quantification of losses of carbon stocks due to land conversion, shifts in GHG fluxes, alterations in net ecosystem productivity, input factors such as fertilisation needs, and biophysical climate impacts (e.g., shifts in albedo, water cycles, etc.). Tropical peatlands account for only about 10% of peatland area and about 20% of peatland carbon stock but about 80% of peatland carbon emissions, primarily from peatland conversion in Indonesia (about 60%) and Malaysia (about 10%) (Hooijer et al. 2010; Page et al. 2011; Leifeld and Menichetti 2018).

Recent studies continue to report high carbon stocks in peatlands and emphasise the vulnerability of peatland carbon after conversion. The carbon stocks of tropical peatlands are among the highest of any forest, 1,211–4,257 tCO2-eq ha –1 in the Peruvian Amazon (Bhomia et al. 2019) and 1,956–14,757 tCO2-eq ha –1 in Indonesia (Novita et al. 2021). Ninety percent of tropical peatland carbon stocks are vulnerable to emission during conversion and may not be recoverable through restoration; in contrast, boreal and temperate peatlands hold similar carbon stocks (1,439–5,619 tCO2-eq ha –1) but only 30% of northern carbon stocks are vulnerable to emission during conversion and irrecoverable through restoration (Goldstein et al. 2020). A recent study shows global mitigation potential of about 0.2 GtCO2-eq yr –1 at costs up to USD100 tCO2–1 (Roe et al. 2021). Another study estimated that 72% of mitigation is achieved through avoided soil carbon impacts, with the remainder through avoided impacts to vegetation (Bossio et al. 2020). Recent model projections show that both peatland protection and peatland restoration (Section 7.4.2.7) are needed to achieve a 2°C mitigation pathway and that peatland protection and restoration policies will have minimal impacts on regional food security (Leifeld et al. 2019, Humpenöder et al. 2020). Global studies have not accounted for extensive peatlands recently reported in the Congo Basin, estimated to cover 145,500 km 2 and contain 30.6 PgC, as much as 29% of total tropical peat carbon stock (Dargie et al. 2017). These Congo peatlands are relatively intact; continued preservation is needed to prevent major emissions (Dargie et al. 2019). In northern peatlands that are underlain by permafrost roughly 50% of the total peatlands north of 23° latitude, (Hugelius et al. 2020), climate change (i.e., warming) is the major driver of peatland degradation (e.g., through permafrost thaw) (Schuur et al. 2015, Goldstein et al. 2020). However, in non-permafrost boreal and temperate peatlands, reduction of peatland conversion is also a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Peatlands are sensitive to climate change and there is low confidence about the future peatland sink globally (SRCCL, Chapter 2). Permafrost thaw may shift northern peatlands from a net carbon sink to net source (Hugelius et al. 2020). Uncertainties in peatland extent and the magnitude of existing carbon stocks, in both northern (Loisel et al. 2014) and tropical (Dargie et al. 2017) latitudes limit understanding of current and future peatland carbon dynamics (Minasny et al. 2019)."

wg3_ch07_7.4.2.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded and damaged peatlands, for example through rewetting and revegetation, which both increases carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils and avoids ongoing CO2 emissions. Peatlands only account for about 3% of the terrestrial surface, predominantly occurring in boreal ecosystems (78%), with a smaller proportion in tropical regions (13%), but may store about 600 GtC or 21% of the global total soil organic carbon stock of about 3000 Gt (Page et al. 2011; Leifeld and Menichetti 2018). Peatland restoration delivers co-benefits for biodiversity, as well as regulating water flow and preventing downstream flooding, while still allowing for extensive management such as paludiculture (Tan et al. 2021). Rewetting of peatlands also reduces the risk of fire, but may also mobilise salts and contaminants in soils (van Diggelen et al. 2020) and in severely degraded peatlands, restoration of peatland hydrology and vegetation may not be feasible (Andersen et al. 2017). At a local level, restoration of peatlands drained for agriculture could displace food production and damage local food supply, although impacts to regional and global food security would be minimal (Humpenöder et al. 2020). Collaborative and transparent planning processes are needed to reduce conflict between competing land uses (Tanneberger et al. 2020b).

Although rewetting of drained peatlands increases CH4 emissions, this effect is often outweighed by decreases in CO2 and N2O emissions but depends very much on local circumstances (Günther et al. 2020). Restoration and rewetting of almost all drained peatlands is needed by 2050 to meet 1.5°C–2°C pathways which is unlikely to happen (Leifeld et al. 2019); immediate rewetting and restoration minimises the warming from cumulative CO2 emissions (Nugent et al. 2019)."

However, estimates of emission factors from rewetting drained tropical peatlands remain uncertain (Wilson et al. 2016; Murdiyarso et al. 2019). Topsoil removal, in combination with rewetting, may improve restoration success and limit CH4 emissions during restoration of highly degraded temperate peatlands (Zak et al. 2018).

Reducing conversion of coastal wetlands, including mangroves, marshes and seagrass ecosystems, avoids emissions from above and below ground biomass and soil carbon through avoided degradation and/or loss. Coastal wetlands occur mainly in estuaries and deltas, areas that are often densely settled, with livelihoods closely linked to coastal ecosystems and resources (Moser et al. 2012). The carbon stocks of these highly productive ecosystems are sometimes referred to as ‘blue carbon’. Loss of existing stocks cannot be easily reversed over decadal time scales (Goldstein et al. 2020). The main drivers of conversion include intensive aquaculture, agriculture, salt ponds, urbanisation and infrastructure development, the extensive use of fertilisers, and extraction of water resources (Lovelock et al. 2018). Reduced conversion of coastal wetlands has many co-benefits, including biodiversity conservation, fisheries production, soil stabilisation, water flow and water quality regulation, flooding and storm surge prevention, and increased resilience to cyclones (Windham-Myers et al. 2018 a; UNEP 2020). Risks associated with the mitigation potential of coastal wetland conservation include uncertain permanence under future climate scenarios, including the effects of coastal squeeze, where coastal wetland area may be lost if upland area is not available for migration as sea levels rise (Lovelock and Reef 2020) (AR6 WGII, Section 3.4.2.5). Preservation of coastal wetlands also conflicts with other land use in the coastal zone, including aquaculture, agriculture, and human development; economic incentives are needed to prioritise wetland preservation over more profitable short-term land use. Integration of policies and efforts aimed at coastal climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and fisheries, for example through integrated coastal zone management and marine spatial planning, will bundle climate mitigation with co-benefits and optimise outcomes (Herr et al. 2017)."

The mitigation potential is derived from quantification of losses of carbon stocks in vegetation and soil due to land conversion, shifts in GHG fluxes associated with land use, and alterations in net ecosystem productivity. The wide range in estimates mostly relate to the scope (all coastal ecosystems vs mangroves only) and different assumptions on decomposition rates. Loss rates of coastal wetlands have been estimated at 0.2–3% yr –1, depending on the vegetation type and location (Atwood et al. 2017; Howard et al. 2017)."

Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded or damaged coastal wetlands including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass ecosystems, leading to sequestration of ‘blue carbon’ in wetland vegetation and soil (SRCCL, Chapter 6; SROCC, Chapter 5). Successful approaches to wetland restoration include: (i) passive restoration, the removal of anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation or preventing recovery; and (ii) active restoration, purposeful manipulations to the environment in order to achieve recovery to a naturally functioning system (Elliott et al. 2016) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 3). Restoration of coastal wetlands delivers many valuable co-benefits, including enhanced water quality, biodiversity, aesthetic values, fisheries production (food security), and protection from rising sea levels and storm impacts (Barbier et al. 2011; Hochard et al. 2019; Sun and Carson 2020; Duarte et al. 2020). Of the 0.3 Mkm 2 coastal wetlands globally, 0.11 Mkm 2 of mangroves are considered feasible for restoration (Griscom et al. 2017). Risks associated with coastal wetland restoration include uncertain permanence under future climate scenarios (IPCC AR6 WGII, Box 3.4), partial offsets of mitigation through enhanced methane and nitrous oxide release and carbonate formation, and competition with other land uses, including aquaculture and human settlement and development in the coastal zone (SROCC, Chapter 5). To date, many coastal wetland restoration efforts do not succeed due to failure to address the drivers of degradation (van Katwijk et al. 2016). However, improved frameworks for implementing and assessing coastal wetland restoration are emerging that emphasise the recovery of ecosystem functions (Zhao et al. 2016; Cadier et al. 2020). Restoration projects that involve local communities at all stages and consider both biophysical and socio-political context are more likely to succeed (Brown et al. 2014; Wylie et al. 2016)."

The SROCC concluded that cost-effective coastal blue carbon restoration had a potential of about 0.15–0.18 GtCO2-eq yr –1, a low global potential compared to other ocean-based solutions but with extensive co-benefits and limited adverse side effects (Gattuso et al. 2018)."

Recent studies emphasise the time frame needed to achieve the full mitigation potential (Duarte et al. 2020; Taillardat et al. 2020). The first project-derived estimate of the net GHG benefit from seagrass restoration found 1.54 tCO2-eq (0.42 MgC) ha –1 yr –110 years after restoration began (Oreska et al. 2020); comparable to the default emission factor in the Wetlands Supplement (Kennedy et al. 2014). Recent studies of rehabilitated mangroves also indicate that annual carbon sequestration rates in biomass and soils can return to natural levels within decades of restoration (Cameron et al. 2019; Sidik et al. 2019). A meta-analysis shows increasing carbon sequestration rates over the first 15 years of mangrove restoration with rates stabilising at 25.7 ± 7.7 tCO2-eq (7.0 ± 2.1 MgC) ha –1 yr –1 through forty years, although success depends on climate, sediment type, and restoration methods (Sasmito et al. 2019). Overall, 30% of mangrove soil carbon stocks and 50–70% of marsh and seagrass carbon stocks are unlikely to recover within 30 years of restoration, underscoring the importance of preventing conversion of coastal wetlands (Goldstein et al. 2020) (Section 7.4.2.8)."

Regional potentials based on country-level estimates from Griscom et al.

Although global potential is relatively moderate, mitigation can be quite significant for countries with extensive coastlines (e.g., Indonesia, Brazil) and for small island states where coastal wetlands have been shown to comprise 24–34% of their total national carbon stock (Donato et al. 2012). Furthermore, non-climatic co-benefits can strongly motivate coastal wetland restoration worldwide (UNEP 2021a). Major successes in both active and passive restoration of seagrasses have been documented in North America and Europe (Lefcheck et al. 2018; de los Santos et al. 2019 ; Orth et al. 2020); passive restoration may also be feasible for mangroves (Cameron et al. 2019)."

Biochar is produced by heating organic matter in oxygen-limited environments (pyrolysis and gasification) (Lehmann and Joseph 2012). Feedstocks include forestry and sawmill residues, straw, manure and biosolids. When applied to soils, biochar is estimated to persist from decades to thousands of years, depending on feedstock and production conditions (J. Wang et al. 2016; Singh et al. 2015). Biochar systems producing biochar for soil application plus bioenergy, generally give greater mitigation than bioenergy alone and other uses of biochar, and are recognised as a CDR strategy. Biochar persistence is increased through interaction with clay minerals and soil organic matter (Fang et al. 2015). Additional CDR benefits arise through ‘negative priming’ whereby biochar stabilises soil carbon and rhizodeposits (Weng et al. 2015; J. Wang et al. 2016; Archanjo et al. 2017; Hagemann et al. 2017; Han Weng et al. 2017; Weng et al. 2018). Besides CDR, additional mitigation can arise from displacing fossil fuels with pyrolysis gases, lower soil N2O emissions (Cayuela et al. 2014, 2015; Song et al. 2016; He et al. 2017; Verhoeven et al. 2017; Borchard et al. 2019), reduced nitrogen fertiliser requirements due to reduced nitrogen leaching and volatilisation from soils (Liu et al. 2019; Borchard et al. 2019), and reduced GHG emissions from compost when biochar is added (Agyarko-Mintah et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017). Biochar application to paddy rice has resulted in substantial reductions (20–40% on average) in N2O (Song et al. 2016; Awad et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018) (Section 7.4.3.5) and smaller reduction in CH4 emissions (Song et al. 2016; Kammann et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2017a; He et al. 2017; Awad et al. 2018). Potential co-benefits include yield increases particularly in sandy and acidic soils with low cation exchange capacity (Woolf et al. 2016; Jeffery et al. 2017); increased soil water-holding capacity (Omondi et al. 2016), nitrogen use efficiency (Liu et al. 2019; Borchard et al. 2019), biological nitrogen fixation (Van Zwieten et al. 2015); adsorption of organic pollutants and heavy metals (e.g., Silvani et al. 2019); odour reduction from manure handling (e.g., Hwang et al. 2018) and managing forest fuel loads (Puettmann et al. 2020). Due to its dark colour, biochar could decrease soil albedo (Meyer et al. 2012), though this is insignificant under recommended rates and application methods. Biochar could reduce enteric CH4 emissions when fed to ruminants (Section 7.4.3.4). Barriers to upscaling include insufficient investment, limited large-scale production facilities, high production costs at small scale, lack of agreed approach to monitoring, reporting and verification, and limited knowledge, standardisation and quality control, restricting user confidence (Gwenzi et al. 2015)."

Developments include mechanistic understanding of ‘negative priming’ and biochar-soil-microbes-plant interactions (DeCiucies et al. 2018; Fang et al. 2019). Indirect climate benefits are associated with persistent yield response to biochar (Kätterer et al. 2019; Ye et al. 2020), improved crop water use efficiency (Du et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2020) and reduced GHG and ammonia emissions from compost and manure (Sanchez-Monedero et al. 2018; Bora et al. 2020a,b; Zhao et al. 2020). A quantification method based on biochar properties is included in the IPCC guidelines for NGHGIs (Domke et al. 2019). Studies report a range of biochar responses, from positive to occasionally adverse impacts, including on GHG emissions, and identify risks (Tisserant and Cherubini 2019). This illustrates the expected variability (Lehmann and Rillig 2014) of responses, which depend on the biochar type and climatic and edaphic characteristics of the site (Zygourakis 2017). Biochar properties vary with feedstock, production conditions and post-production treatments, so mitigation and agronomic benefits are maximised when biochars are chosen to suit the application context (Mašek et al. 2018). A recent assessment finds greatest economic potential (up to USD100 tCO2–1) between 2020 and 2050 to be in Asia and the Pacific (793 MtCO2 yr –1) followed by Developed Countries (447 MtCO2 yr –1) (Roe et al. 2021). Mitigation through biochar will be greatest where biochar is applied to responsive soils (acidic, low fertility), where soil N2O emissions are high (intensive horticulture, irrigated crops), and where the syngas co-product displaces fossil fuels. Due to the early stage of commercialisation, mitigation estimates are based pilot-scale facilities, leading to uncertainty. However, the long-term persistence of biochar carbon in soils has been widely studied (Singh et al. 2012; Fang et al. 2019; Zimmerman and Ouyang 2019). The greatest uncertainty is the availability of sustainably-sourced biomass for biochar production."

Agroforestry is a set of diverse land management systems that integrate trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock in space and/or time. Agroforestry accumulates carbon in woody vegetation and soil (Ramachandran Nair et al. 2010) and offers multiple co-benefits such as increased land productivity, diversified livelihoods, reduced soil erosion, improved water quality, and more hospitable regional climates (Ellison et al. 2017; Kuyah et al. 2019; Mbow et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020). Incorporation of trees and shrubs in agricultural systems, however, can affect food production, biodiversity, local hydrology and contribute to social inequality (Amadu et al. 2020; Fleischman et al. 2020; Holl and Brancalion 2020). To minimise risks and maximise co-benefits, agroforestry should be implemented as part of support systems that deliver tools, and information to increase farmers’ agency. This may include reforming policies, strengthening extension systems and creating market opportunities that enable adoption (Jamnadass et al. 2020; Sendzimir et al. 2011; P. Smith et al. 2019 a). Consideration of carbon sequestration in the context of food and fuel production, as well as environmental co-benefits at the farm, local, and regional scales can further help support decisions to plant, regenerate and maintain agroforestry systems (Kumar and Nair 2011; Miller et al. 2020). In spite of the advantages, biophysical and socio-economic factors can limit the adoption (Pattanayak et al. 2003).

The SRCCL estimated the global technical mitigation potential of agroforestry, with medium confidence, to be between 0.08 and 5.6 GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2050 (Griscom et al. 2017; Dickie et al. 2014a; Zomer et al. 2016; Hawken 2017). Estimates are derived from syntheses of potential area available for various agroforestry systems, for example, windbreaks, farmer managed natural regeneration, and alley cropping and average annual rates of carbon accumulation. The cost-effective economic potential, also with medium confidence, is more limited at 0.3–2.4 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Zomer et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019).

Updated estimates of agroforestry’s technical mitigation potential and synthesised estimates of carbon sequestration across agroforestry systems have since been published. The most recent global analysis estimates technical potential of 9.4 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Chapman et al. 2020) of agroforestry on 1.87 and 1.89 billion ha of crop and pasture lands below median carbon content, respectively. This estimate is at least 68% greater than the largest estimate reported in the SRCCL (Hawken 2017) and represents a new conservative upper bound as Chapman et al. (2020) only accounted for above-ground carbon. Considering both above- and below-ground carbon of windbreaks, alley cropping and silvopastoral systems at a more limited areal extent (Griscom et al. 2020), the economic potential of agroforestry was estimated to be only about 0.8 GtCO2-eq yr –1. Variation in estimates primarily result from assumptions on the agroforestry systems including, extent of implementation and estimated carbon sequestration potential when converting to agroforestry."
wg3_ch07_7.4.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Regional estimates of mitigation potential are scant with agroforestry options differing significantly by geography (Feliciano et al. 2018). For example, multi-strata shaded coffee and cacao are successful in the humid tropics (Somarriba et al. 2013; Blaser et al. 2018), silvopastoral systems are prevalent in Latin American (Peters et al. 2013; Landholm et al. 2019) while agrosilvopastoral systems, shelterbelts, hedgerows, and windbreaks are common in Europe (Joffre et al. 1988; Rigueiro-Rodriguez 2009). At the field scale, agroforestry accumulates between 0.59 and 6.24 t ha –1 yr –1 of carbon above-ground. Below-ground carbon often constitutes 25% or more of the potential carbon gains in agroforestry systems (De Stefano and Jacobson 2018; Cardinael et al. 2018). Roe et al. (2021) estimate greatest regional economic (up to USD100 tCO2–1) mitigation potential for the period 2020–2050 to be in Asia and the Pacific (368.4 MtCO2-eq yr –1) and Developed Countries (264.7 MtCO2-eq yr –1)."

Despite uncertainty around global estimates due to regional preferences for management systems, suitable land availability, and growing conditions, there is high confidence in agroforestry’s mitigation potential at the field scale. With countless options for farmers and land managers to implement agroforestry, there is medium confidence in the feasibility of achieving estimated regional mitigation potential.

The degree of complexity influences the multiple functions that farmers and societies can attain from agroforestry: the more complex it is, the more it resembles a natural forest with associated benefits for its carbon storage capacity and its habitat quality for biodiversity (Santos et al. 2019). However, trade-offs exist between the complexity and scalability of agroforestry as complex systems rely on intensive manual labour to achieve high productivity (Tscharntke et al. 2011). To date, mechanisation of structurally diverse agroforests is scarce and hence, efficiencies of scale are difficult to achieve."

Research into other inhibitors/feeds containing inhibitory compounds, such as macroalga or seaweed (Chagas et al. 2019; Kinley et al. 2020; Roque et al. 2019), shows promise, although concerns have been raised regarding palatability, toxicity, environmental impacts and the development of industrial-scale supply chains (Abbott et al. 2020; Vijn et al. 2020). In the absence of CH4 vaccines, which are still under development (Reisinger et al. 2021) pasture-based and non-intensive systems remain reliant on increasing production efficiency (Beauchemin et al. 2020).

Emissions from rice cultivation mainly concern CH4 associated with anaerobic conditions, although N2O emission also occur via nitrification and denitrification processes. Measures to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions include (i) improved water management (e.g., single drainage and multiple drainage practices), (ii) improved residue management, (iii) improved fertiliser application (e.g., using slow release fertiliser and nutrient specific application), and (iv) soil amendments (including biochar and organic amendments) (Pandey et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2017b; Yagi et al. 2020; Sriphirom et al. 2020). These measures not only have mitigation potential but can improve water use efficiency, reduce overall water use, enhance drought adaptation and overall system resilience, improve yield, reduce production costs from seed, pesticide, pumping and labour, increase farm income, and promote sustainable development (Quynh and Sander 2015; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Tran et al. 2018; Sriphirom et al. 2019). However, in terms of mitigation of CH4 and N2O, antagonistic effects can occur, whereby water management can enhance N2O emissions due to creation of alternate wet and dry conditions (Sriphirom et al. 2019), with trade-offs between CH4 and N2O during the drying period potentially offsetting some mitigation benefits. Barriers to adoption may include site-specific limitations regarding soil type, percolation and seepage rates or fluctuations in precipitation, water canal or irrigation infrastructure, paddy surface level and rice field size, and social factors including farmer perceptions, pump ownership, and challenges in synchronising water management between neighbours and pumping stations (Quynh and Sander 2015; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Yamaguchi et al. 2019)."

Since AR5 and the SRCCL, studies on mitigation have principally focused on water and nutrient management practices with the aim of improving overall sustainability as well as measurements of site-specific emissions to help improve the resolution of regional estimates. Intensity of emissions show considerable spatial and temporal variation, dependent on site specific factors including degradation of soil organic matter, management of water levels in the field, the types and amount of fertilisers applied, rice variety and local cultivation practices. Variation in CH4 emissions have been found to range from 0.5–41.8 mg m 2 hr –1 in South-East Asia (Sander et al. 2014; Chidthaisong et al. 2018; Setyanto et al. 2018; Sibayan et al. 2018; J.

Wang et al. 2018; Takakai et al. 2020),  and 0.5–10.4 mg m 2 hr –1 in North America (J. Wang et al. 2018). Current studies on emissions of N2O also showed high variation in the range of 0.13–654 ug/m 2/hr (Akiyama et al. 2005; Islam et al. 2018; Kritee et al. 2018; Zschornack et al. 2018; Oo et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.3.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recent studies on water management have highlighted the potential to mitigate GHG emissions, while also enhancing water use efficiency (Tran et al. 2018). A meta-analysis on multiple drainage systems found that Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD) with irrigation management, can reduce CH4 emissions by 20–30% and water use by 25.7%, though this resulted in a slight yield reduction (5.4%) (Carrijo et al. 2017). Other studies have described improved yields associated with AWD (Tran et al. 2018). Water management for both single and multiple drainage can (most likely ) reduce methane emissions by about 35% but increase N2O emissions by about 20% (Yagi et al. 2020). However, N2O emissions occur only under dry conditions, therefore total reduction in terms of net GWP is approximately 30%. Emissions of N2O are higher during dry seasons (Yagi et al. 2020) and depend on site specific factors as well as the quantity of fertiliser and organic matter inputs into the paddy rice system. Variability of N2O emissions from single and multiple drainage can range from 0.06–33 kg/ha (Hussain et al. 2015; Kritee et al. 2018). AWD in Vietnam was found to reduce both CH4 and N2O emissions by 29–30 and 26–27% respectively with the combination of net GWP about 30% as compared to continuous flooding (Tran et al. 2018). Overall, greatest average economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1) between 2020 and 2050 is estimated to be in Asia and the Pacific (147.2 MtCO2-eq yr –1) followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (8.9 MtCO2-eq yr –1) using the IPCC AR4 GWP100 value for CH4 (Roe et al. 2021)."

wg3_ch07_7.4.3.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Improved crop nutrient management can reduce N2O emissions from cropland soils. Practices include optimising fertiliser application delivery, rates and timing, utilising different fertiliser types (i.e., organic manures, composts and synthetic forms), and using slow or controlled-released fertilisers or nitrification inhibitors (Smith et al. 2014; Griscom et al. 2017; P. Smith et al. 2019 a). In addition to individual practices, integrated nutrient management that combines crop rotations including intercropping, nitrogen biological fixation, reduced tillage, use of cover crops, manure and bio-fertiliser application, soil testing and comprehensive nitrogen management plans, is suggested as central for optimising fertiliser use, enhancing nutrient uptake and potentially reducing N2O emissions (Bationo et al. 2012; Lal et al. 2018; Bolinder et al. 2020; Jensen et al. 2020; Namatsheve et al. 2020). Such practices may generate additional mitigation by indirectly reducing synthetic fertiliser manufacturing requirements and associated emissions, though such mitigation is accounted for in the Industry Sector and not considered in this chapter. Tailored nutrient management approaches, such as 4R nutrient stewardship, are implemented in contrasting farming systems and contexts and supported by best management practices to balance and match nutrient supply with crop requirements, provide greater stability in fertiliser performance and to minimise N2O emissions and nutrient losses from fields and farms (Fixen 2020; Maaz et al. 2021). Co-benefits of improved nutrient management can include enhanced soil quality (notably when manure, crop residues or compost is utilised), carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, soil water holding capacity, adaptation capacity, crop yields, farm incomes, water quality (from reduced nitrate leaching and eutrophication), air quality (from reduced ammonia emissions) and in certain cases, it may facilitate land sparing (Sapkota et al. 2014; Johnston and Bruulsema 2014; Zhang et al. 2017; P.

Fertiliser use in Developed Countries is already high (Figure 7.10) with increased nutrient use efficiency among the most promising mitigation measures (Roe et al. 2019; Hijbeek et al. 2019). Considering that Asia and Pacific, and Developed Countries accounted for the greatest share of global nitrogen fertiliser use, it is not surprising that these regions are estimated to have greatest economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1) between 2020 and 2050, at 161.8 and 37.1 MtCO2-eq yr –1 respectively (using the IPCC AR4 GWP100 value for N2O) (Roe et al. 2021)."

However, their mitigation persistence (McGinn et al. 2019), cost (Carroll and Daigneault 2019; Alvarez-Hess et al. 2019) and public acceptance (Jayasundara et al. 2016) or regulatory approval is currently unclear while administration in pasture-based systems is likely to be challenging (Patra et al. 2017; Leahy et al. 2019). Research into other inhibitors/feeds containing inhibitory compounds, such as macroalga or seaweed (Chagas et al. 2019; Kinley et al. 2020; Roque et al. 2019), shows promise, although concerns have been raised regarding palatability, toxicity, environmental impacts and the development of industrial-scale supply chains (Abbott et al. 2020; Vijn et al. 2020). In the absence of CH4 vaccines, which are still under development (Reisinger et al. 2021) pasture-based and non-intensive systems remain reliant on increasing production efficiency (Beauchemin et al. 2020).

Therefore, verification of regional estimates indicated by global assessments is challenging. Feed quality improvement, which may have considerable potential in developing countries (Caro et al. 2016; Mottet et al. 2017a), may have negative wider impacts.

Emissions from rice cultivation mainly concern CH4 associated with anaerobic conditions, although N2O emission also occur via nitrification and denitrification processes. Measures to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions include (i) improved water management (e.g., single drainage and multiple drainage practices), (ii) improved residue management, (iii) improved fertiliser application (e.g., using slow release fertiliser and nutrient specific application), and (iv) soil amendments (including biochar and organic amendments) (Pandey et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2017b; Yagi et al. 2020; Sriphirom et al. 2020). These measures not only have mitigation potential but can improve water use efficiency, reduce overall water use, enhance drought adaptation and overall system resilience, improve yield, reduce production costs from seed, pesticide, pumping and labour, increase farm income, and promote sustainable development (Quynh and Sander 2015; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Tran et al. 2018; Sriphirom et al. 2019). However, in terms of mitigation of CH4 and N2O, antagonistic effects can occur, whereby water management can enhance N2O emissions due to creation of alternate wet and dry conditions (Sriphirom et al. 2019), with trade-offs between CH4 and N2O during the drying period potentially offsetting some mitigation benefits. Barriers to adoption may include site-specific limitations regarding soil type, percolation and seepage rates or fluctuations in precipitation, water canal or irrigation infrastructure, paddy surface level and rice field size, and social factors including farmer perceptions, pump ownership, and challenges in synchronising water management between neighbours and pumping stations (Quynh and Sander 2015; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Yamaguchi et al. 2019)."

The SRCCL estimated a global mitigation potential from improved rice cultivation of 0.08–0.87 GtCO2-eq yr –1 between 2020 and 2050, with the range representing the difference between technical and economic constraints, types of activities included (e.g., improved water management and straw residue management) and GHGs considered (Dickie et al. 2014a; Beach et al. 2015; Paustian et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017) (SRCCL, Chapter 2)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL).  Since AR5 and the SRCCL, studies on mitigation have principally focused on water and nutrient management practices with the aim of improving overall sustainability as well as measurements of site-specific emissions to help improve the resolution of regional estimates. Intensity of emissions show considerable spatial and temporal variation, dependent on site specific factors including degradation of soil organic matter, management of water levels in the field, the types and amount of fertilisers applied, rice variety and local cultivation practices. Variation in CH4 emissions have been found to range from 0.5–41.8 mg m 2 hr –1 in South-East Asia (Sander et al. 2014; Chidthaisong et al. 2018; Setyanto et al. 2018; Sibayan et al. 2018; J. Wang et al. 2018; Maneepitak et al. 2019), 0.5–37.0 mg m 2 hr –1 in Southern and Eastern Asia (Zhang et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2012; Oo et al. 2018; J. Wang et al. 2018; Takakai et al. 2020),  and 0.5–10.4 mg m 2 hr –1 in North America (J. Wang et al. 2018). Current studies on emissions of N2O also showed high variation in the range of 0.13–654 ug/m 2/hr (Akiyama et al. 2005; Islam et al. 2018; Kritee et al. 2018; Zschornack et al. 2018; Oo et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.3.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recent studies on water management have highlighted the potential to mitigate GHG emissions, while also enhancing water use efficiency (Tran et al. 2018). A meta-analysis on multiple drainage systems found that Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD) with irrigation management, can reduce CH4 emissions by 20–30% and water use by 25.7%, though this resulted in a slight yield reduction (5.4%) (Carrijo et al. 2017). Other studies have described improved yields associated with AWD (Tran et al. 2018). Water management for both single and multiple drainage can (most likely ) reduce methane emissions by about 35% but increase N2O emissions by about 20% (Yagi et al. 2020). However, N2O emissions occur only under dry conditions, therefore total reduction in terms of net GWP is approximately 30%. Emissions of N2O are higher during dry seasons (Yagi et al. 2020) and depend on site specific factors as well as the quantity of fertiliser and organic matter inputs into the paddy rice system. Variability of N2O emissions from single and multiple drainage can range from 0.06–33 kg/ha (Hussain et al. 2015; Kritee et al. 2018). AWD in Vietnam was found to reduce both CH4 and N2O emissions by 29–30 and 26–27% respectively with the combination of net GWP about 30% as compared to continuous flooding (Tran et al. 2018). Overall, greatest average economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1) between 2020 and 2050 is estimated to be in Asia and the Pacific (147.2 MtCO2-eq yr –1) followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (8.9 MtCO2-eq yr –1) using the IPCC AR4 GWP100 value for CH4 (Roe et al. 2021)."

wg3_ch07_7.4.3.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Improved crop nutrient management can reduce N2O emissions from cropland soils. Practices include optimising fertiliser application delivery, rates and timing, utilising different fertiliser types (i.e., organic manures, composts and synthetic forms), and using slow or controlled-released fertilisers or nitrification inhibitors (Smith et al. 2014; Griscom et al. 2017; P. Smith et al. 2019 a). In addition to individual practices, integrated nutrient management that combines crop rotations including intercropping, nitrogen biological fixation, reduced tillage, use of cover crops, manure and bio-fertiliser application, soil testing and comprehensive nitrogen management plans, is suggested as central for optimising fertiliser use, enhancing nutrient uptake and potentially reducing N2O emissions (Bationo et al. 2012; Lal et al. 2018; Bolinder et al. 2020; Jensen et al. 2020; Namatsheve et al. 2020). Such practices may generate additional mitigation by indirectly reducing synthetic fertiliser manufacturing requirements and associated emissions, though such mitigation is accounted for in the Industry Sector and not considered in this chapter. Tailored nutrient management approaches, such as 4R nutrient stewardship, are implemented in contrasting farming systems and contexts and supported by best management practices to balance and match nutrient supply with crop requirements, provide greater stability in fertiliser performance and to minimise N2O emissions and nutrient losses from fields and farms (Fixen 2020; Maaz et al. 2021). Co-benefits of improved nutrient management can include enhanced soil quality (notably when manure, crop residues or compost is utilised), carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, soil water holding capacity, adaptation capacity, crop yields, farm incomes, water quality (from reduced nitrate leaching and eutrophication), air quality (from reduced ammonia emissions) and in certain cases, it may facilitate land sparing (Sapkota et al. 2014; Johnston and Bruulsema 2014; Zhang et al. 2017; P. Smith et al. 2019 a; Mbow et al. 2019)."

Improved crop nutrient management is feasible in all regions, but effectiveness is context dependent. Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the lowest global fertiliser consumption rates, with increased fertiliser use suggested as necessary to meet projected future food requirements (Mueller et al. 2012; ten Berge et al. 2019; Adam et al. 2020; Falconnier et al. 2020). Fertiliser use in Developed Countries is already high (Figure 7.10) with increased nutrient use efficiency among the most promising mitigation measures (Roe et al. 2019; Hijbeek et al. 2019). Considering that Asia and Pacific, and Developed Countries accounted for the greatest share of global nitrogen fertiliser use, it is not surprising that these regions are estimated to have greatest economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO2-eq –1) between 2020 and 2050, at 161.8 and 37.1 MtCO2-eq yr –1 respectively (using the IPCC AR4 GWP100 value for N2O) (Roe et al. 2021)."

As with other non-CO2GHG mitigation estimates, values may slightly differ depending upon which IPCC GWP100 values were used.

These may incorporate several of the mitigation measures described in Section 7.4.3, while potentially also delivering environmental co-benefits. This Box assesses evidence specifically on the mitigation capacity of some such system approaches. The approaches are not mutually exclusive, may share similar principles or practices and can be complimentary. In all cases, mitigation may result from either (i) emission reductions or (ii) enhanced carbon sequestration, via combinations of management practices as outlined in Figure 1 within this Box.

Limited evidence concerning the mitigation capacity of AE at a system level (Saj et al. 2017; Snapp et al. 2021) makes conclusions difficult, yet studies into specific practices that may be incorporated, suggest AE may have mitigation potential (medium confidence) (Section 7.4.3). However, AE, that incorporates management practices used in organic farming (see below), may result in reduced yields, driving compensatory agricultural production elsewhere. Research into GHG mitigation by AE as a system and impacts of wide-scale implementation is required. Despite absence of a universally accepted definition (see Annex I), RA is gaining increasing attention and shares principles of AE. Some descriptions include carbon sequestration as a specific aim (Elevitch et al. 2018). Few studies have assessed mitigation potential of RA at a system level (e.g., Colley et al. 2020). Like AE, it is likely  that RA can contribute to mitigation, the extent to which is currently unclear and by its case-specific design, will vary (medium confidence)."

OF is perhaps noted more for potential co-benefits, such as enhanced system resilience and biodiversity promotion, than mitigation. Several studies have reviewed the emissions footprint of organic compared to conventional systems (Mondelaers et al. 2009; Tuomisto et al. 2012; Skinner et al. 2014; Meier et al. 2015; Seufert and Ramankutty 2017; Clark and Tilman 2017; Meemken and Qaim 2018; Bellassen et al. 2021). Acknowledging potential assessment limitations (Meier et al. 2015; van der Werf et al. 2020), evidence suggests organic production to typically generate lower emissions per unit of area, while emissions per unit of product vary and depend on the product ( high agreement , medium evidence). OF has been suggested to increase soil carbon sequestration (Gattinger et al. 2012), though definitive conclusions are challenging (Leifeld et al. 2013). Fewer studies consider impacts of large-scale conversion from conventional to organic production globally.

Large-scale conversion, without fundamental changes in food systems and diets (Muller et al. 2017; Theurl et al. 2020), may lead to increases in absolute emissions from land-use change, driven by greater land requirements to maintain production (L.G.

wg3_ch07_box-7.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"The study shows that by 2030 under BAU scenario GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 MtCO2-eq yr –1 (using GWP100 and IPCC AR4 values) with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO2-eq yr –1 through the adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, for example, efficient use of fertiliser, zero-tillage, and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. Under the BAU scenario the projected GHG emissions from major crop and livestock species is estimated at 489 MtCO2-eq in 2030, whereas under mitigation scenario GHG emissions are estimated at 410 MtCO2-eq implying a technical mitigation option of about 78.67 MtCO2-eq yr –1 (Box 7.6, Figure 1). Major sources of projected emissions under the BAU scenario, in order of importance, were cattle, rice, buffalo, and small ruminants. Although livestock production and rice cultivation account for a major share of agricultural emissions, the highest mitigation potential was observed in rice (about 36 MtCO2-eq yr –1) followed by buffalo (about 14 MtCO2-eq yr –1), wheat (about 11 MtCO2-eq yr –1) and cattle (about 7 MtCO2-eq yr –1). Crops such as cotton and sugarcane each offered mitigation potential of about 5 MtCO2-eq yr –1 while the mitigation potential from small ruminants (goat/sheep) was about 2 MtCO2-eq yr –1."

When the additional benefits of increased yield due to adoption of the mitigation measures were considered, about 80% of the technical mitigation potential (67.5 out of 85.5 MtCO2-eq) could be achieved by cost-saving measures. When yield benefits were considered, green fodder supplements to ruminant diets were the most cost-effective mitigation measure, followed by vermicomposting and improved diet management of small ruminants. Mitigation measures such as fertigation and micro-irrigation, various methods of restoring degraded land and feed additives in livestock appear to be cost-prohibitive, even when considering yield benefits, if any. The study accounted for GHG emissions at the farm level and excluded emissions arising due to processing, marketing or consumption post farm-gate. It also did not include emissions from feed production, since livestock in India mostly rely on crop by-products and concentrates. Further the potential of laser land levelling seems exaggerated which may also be redundant with already accounted potential from ‘improved water management in rice’. The mitigation potential of agroecological approaches/technologies such as natural farming which is picking up in India in recent years has also been overlooked."

It may reduce net GHG emissions by displacing the use of coal, oil and natural gas with renewable biomass in the production of heat, electricity, and fuels. When combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and biochar production, bioenergy systems may provide CDR by durably storing biogenic carbon in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products, further contributing to mitigation (Chum et al. 2011; Cabral et al. 2019; Hammar and Levihn 2020; Emenike et al. 2020; Moreira et al. 2020b; Y.

Bioenergy systems are commonly integrated within forest and agriculture systems that produce food, feed, lumber, paper and other bio-based products. They can also be combined with other AFOLU mitigation options: deployment of energy crops, agroforestry and A/R can provide biomass while increasing land carbon stocks (Sections 7.4.2.2 and 7.4.3.3) and anaerobic digestion of manure and wastewater, to reduce methane emissions, can produce biogas and CO2 for storage (Section 7.4.3.7). But ill-deployment of energy crops can also cause land carbon losses (Hanssen et al. 2020) and increased biomass demand for energy could hamper other mitigation measures such as reduced deforestation and degradation (Sections 7.4.2.1)."

It is difficult to disentangle bioenergy development from the overall development in the AFOLU sector given its multiple interactions with food, land, and energy systems. It is therefore not possible to precisely determine the scale of bioenergy and BECCS deployment at which negative impacts outweigh benefits. Important uncertainties include governance systems, future food and biomaterials demand, land-use practices, energy systems development, climate impacts, and time scale considered when weighing negative impacts against benefits (Robledo-Abad et al. 2017; Turner et al. 2018b; Daioglou et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019; Kalt et al. 2020; Hanssen et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021; Cowie et al. 2021) (SRCCL, Cross-Chapter Box 7; Box 7.7).

Literature complementary to IAM studies indicate opportunities for integration of biomass production systems into agricultural landscapes (e.g., agroforestry, double cropping) to produce biomass while achieving co-benefits (Section 12.5). Similarly, climate-smart forestry puts forward measures (Box 7.3) adapted to regional circumstances in forest sectors, enabling co-benefits in nature conservation, soil protection, employment and income generation, and provision of wood for buildings, bioenergy and other bio-based products (Nabuurs et al. 2017)."

Therefore, shifting toward sustainable and healthy diets requires effective food-system oriented reform policies that integrate agriculture, health, and environment policies to comprehensively address synergies and conflicts in co-lateral sectors  (agriculture, trade, health, environment protection etc.) and capture spill-over effects, for example, climate change, biodiversity loss, food poverty (FAO and WHO 2019; Galli et al. 2020)."

According to the AR5, changes in human diets and consumption patterns can reduce emissions 5.3 to 20.2 GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2050 from diverted agricultural production and avoided land-use change (Smith et al. 2014). In the SRCCL, a ‘contract and converge’ model of transition to sustainable healthy diets was suggested as an effective approach, reducing food consumption in over-consuming populations and increasing consumption of some food groups in populations where minimum nutritional needs are not met (P. Smith et al. 2019 a). The total technical mitigation potential of changes in human diets was estimated as 0.7–8 GtCO2-eq yr –1 by 2050 (Tilman and Clark 2014; Springmann et al. 2016; Hawken 2017) (SRCCL, Chapter 2 and 6), ranging from a 50% adoption of healthy diets (<60g of animal-based protein) and only accounting for diverted agricultural production, to the global adoption of a vegetarian diet."

Poore and Nemecek (2018) revealed that shifting towards diets that exclude animal-source food could reduce land use by 3.1 billion ha, decrease food-related GHG emissions by 6.5 GtCO2-eq yr –1, acidification by 50%, eutrophication by 49%, and freshwater withdrawals by 19% for a 2010 reference year. Frank et al. (2019)  estimated non-CO2 emissions reductions of 0.4 GtCO2-eq yr –1 at a carbon price of USD100 tCO2–1 and 0.6 GtCO2-eq yr –1 at USD20 tCO2–1 in 2050 from shifting to lower animal-source diets (430 kcal of livestock calorie intake) in developed and emerging countries. From a systematic literature review, Ivanova et al. (2020)  found mitigation potentials of 0.4–2.1 tCO2-eq capita –1 for a vegan diet, of 0.01–1.5 for a vegetarian diet, and of 0.1–2.0 for Mediterranean or similar healthy diet."

In the EU, (Latka et al. 2021) found that moving to healthy diets through price incentives could bring about annual reductions of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture of 12–111 MtCO2-eq yr –1. At the country level, recent studies show that following National Dietary Guidelines (NDG) would reduce food system GHG emissions by 4–42%, confer large health gains (1.0–1.5 million quality-adjusted life-years) and lower health care system costs (NZD 14–20 billion) in New Zealand Drew et al. (2020); reduce 28% of GHG emissions in Argentina Arrieta and González (2018); about 25% in Portugal Esteve-Llorens et al.

Therefore, a transition towards low-GHG emission diets and achieving their mitigation potential requires a combination of appropriate policies, financial and non-financial incentives and awareness-raising campaigns to induce changes in consumer behaviour with potential synergies between climate objectives, health and equity (Rust et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers. Food loss and waste (FLW) refer to the edible parts of plants and animals produced for human consumption that are not ultimately consumed (UNEP 2021b). Food loss occurs through spoilage, spilling or other unintended consequences due to limitations in agricultural infrastructure, storage and packaging (Parfitt et al. 2010). Food waste typically takes place at the distribution (retail and food service) and consumption stages in the food supply chain and refers to food appropriate for human consumption that is discarded or left to spoil (HLPE 2014). Options that could reduce FLW include: investing in harvesting and post-harvesting technologies in developing countries, taxing and other incentives to reduce business and consumer-level waste in developed countries, mandatory FLW reporting and reduction targets for large food businesses, regulation of unfair trading practices, and active marketing of cosmetically imperfect products (van Giesen and de Hooge 2019; Sinclair Taylor et al. 2019). Other studies suggested providing options of longer-lasting products and behavioural changes (e.g., through information provision) that cause dietary and consumption changes and motivate consumers to actively make decisions that reduce FLW. Reductions of FLW along the food chain bring a range of benefits beyond GHG mitigation, including reducing environmental stress (e.g., water and land competition, land degradation, desertification), safeguarding food security, and reducing poverty (Galford et al. 2020; Venkatramanan et al. 2020). Additionally, FLW reduction is crucial for achieving SDG 12 which calls for ensuring ‘sustainable consumption and production patterns’ through lowering per capita global food waste by 50% at the retail and consumer level and reducing food losses along food supply chains by 2030. In line with these SDG targets, it is estimated that reducing FLW can free up several million km 2 of land ( high confidence). The interlinkages between reducing FLW and food system sustainability are discussed in Chapter 12. Recent literature identifies a range of barriers to climate change mitigation through FLW reduction, which are linked to technological, biophysical, socio-economic, financial and cultural contexts at regional and local levels (Vogel and Meyer 2018; Gromko and Abdurasalova 2019; Rogissart et al. 2019; Blok et al. 2020). Examples of these barriers include infrastructural and capacity limitations, institutional regulations, financial resources, constraining resources (e.g., energy), information gaps (e.g., with retailers), and consumers’ behaviour (Gromko and Abdurasalova 2019; Blok et al. 2020)."

In the SRCCL, the technical mitigation potential of reducing food and agricultural waste was estimated at 0.76–4.5 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Bajželj et al. 2014; Dickie et al. 2014b; Hawken 2017) (SRCCL, Chapter 2 and 6)."
wg3_ch07_7.4.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL).  Since the SRCCL, there have been very few quantitative estimates of the mitigation potential of FLW reductions. Evidence suggests that reducing FLW together with overall food intake could have substantial mitigation potential, equating to an average of 0.3 tCO2-eq capita –1 (Ivanova et al. 2020). Some regional sectoral studies indicate that reducing FLW in the EU can reduce emissions by 186 MtCO2-eq yr –1, the equivalent of around 15% of the environmental impacts (climate, acidification, and eutrophication) of the entire food value chain (Scherhaufer et al. 2018). In the UK, disruptive low-carbon innovations relating to FLW reduction were found to be associated with potential emissions reductions ranging between 2.6 and 3.6 MtCO2-eq (Wilson et al. 2019). Other studies investigated the effect of tax mechanisms, such as ‘pay as you throw’ for household waste, on the mitigation potential of reducing FLW. Generally, these mechanisms are recognised as particularly effective in reducing the amount of waste and increasing the recycling rate of households (Carattini et al. 2018; Rogissart et al. 2019). Technological FWL mitigation opportunities exist throughout the food supply chain; post-harvest opportunities for FLW reductions are discussed in Chapter 12. Based on IPCC AR4 GWP100 values for CH4 and N2O, greatest economic mitigation potential (up to USD100 tCO2–1) for the period 2020–2050 from FLW reduction is estimated to be in Asia and Pacific (192.3 GtCO2-eq yr –1) followed by Developed Countries (101.6 GtCO2-eq yr –1) (Roe et al. 2021).

Potentials at 3.7 (2.2–5.1) GtCO2-eq yr –1 are considered plausible. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 0.5 (0.0–0.9) GtCO2-eq yr –1. See the section above for the joint land-use effects of food related demand-side measures which increases three-fold when accounting for the land-use effects as well.

The use of wood products refers to the fate of harvested wood for material uses and includes two distinctly different components affecting the carbon cycle, including carbon storage in wood products and material substitution. When harvested wood is used for the manufacture of wood products, carbon remains stored in these products depending on their end use and lifetime. Carbon storage in wood products can be increased through enhancing the inflow of products in use, or effectively reducing the outflow of the products after use. This can be achieved through additional harvest under sustainable management (Pilli et al. 2015; Johnston and Radeloff 2019), changing the allocation of harvested wood to long-lived wood products or by increasing products’ lifetime and increasing recycling (Brunet-Navarro et al. 2017; Jasinevičius et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2021). Material substitution involves the use of wood for building, textiles, or other applications instead of other materials (e.g., concrete or steel, which consume more energy to produce) to avoid or reduce emissions associated with the production, use and disposal of those products it replaces."

First of all, the enhanced use of wood products could potentially activate or lead to improved sustainable forest management that can mitigate and adapt (Verkerk et al. 2020). Secondly, carbon storage in wood products and the potential for substitution effects can be increased by additional harvest, but with the risk of decreasing carbon storage in forest biomass when not done sustainably (P. Smith et al. 2019 a). Conversely, reduced harvest may lead to gains in carbon storage in forest ecosystems locally, but these gains may be offset through international trade of forest products causing increased harvesting pressure or even degradation elsewhere (Kastner et al. 2011; Kallio et al. 2018; Pendrill et al. 2019b).

However, there is still limited understanding of the substitution effects at the level of markets, countries (Leskinen et al. 2018).

Traded feedstock provided another 0.071 GtCO2 yr –1 of carbon storage in 2015 and 0.12 GtCO2 yr –1 by 2065. These potentials exclude the effect of material substitution. Another recent study estimated the global mitigation potential of mid-rise urban buildings designed with engineered wood products at 0.04–3.7 GtCO2 yr –1 (Churkina et al. 2020). Another study (Oliver et al. 2014) estimated that using wood to substitute for concrete and steel as building materials could provide a technical mitigation potential of 0.78–1.73 GtCO2 yr –1 achieved through carbon storage in wood products and through material and energy substitution."

There is medium confidence that material substitution and carbon storage in wood products contribute to climate change mitigation when also the carbon balances of forest ecosystems are considered of sustainably managed large areas of forests in medium term.

The assessments of individual mitigation measures or sectoral estimates used to estimate mitigation potential in Section 7.4, when aggregated together, do not account for interactions and trade-offs. Integrative land-use models (ILMs) combine different land-based mitigation options and are partially included in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which combine insights from various disciplines in a single framework and cover the largest sources of anthropogenic GHG emissions from different sectors. Over time, ILMs and IAMs have extended their system coverage (Johnson et al. 2019). However, the explicit modelling and analysis of integrated land-use systems is relatively new compared to other sectoral assessments such as the energy system (Jia et al. 2019). Consequently, ILMs as well as IAMs differ in their portfolio and representation of land-based mitigation options, the representation of sustainability goals other than climate action as well as the interplay with mitigation in other sectors (van Soest et al. 2019; Johnson et al. 2019). These structural differences have implications for the regional and global deployment of different mitigation options as well as their sustainability impacts."
wg3_ch07_7.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"As a consequence of the relative novelty of land-based mitigation assessment in ILMs and IAMs, the portfolio of land-based mitigation options does not cover the full option space as outlined in Section 7.4.

Land-based mitigation options are only partially included in ILM and IAM analyses, which mostly rely on afforestation/reforestation and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Most ILM and IAM scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al. 2017), which is a set of contrasting future scenarios widely used in the research community such as in the CMIP6 exercise, the SRCCL and the IPBES global assessment. However, the coverage of land-based mitigation options in these scenarios is mostly limited to dietary changes, higher efficiency in food processing (especially in livestock production systems), reduction of food waste, increasing agricultural productivity, methane reductions in rice paddies, livestock and grazing management for reduced methane emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management, improvement of N-efficiency, international trade, first generation of biofuels, avoided deforestation, afforestation, bioenergy and BECCS (Popp et al. 2017; Van Meijl et al. 2018; Frank et al. 2019). Hence, there are mitigation options not being broadly included in integrated pathway modelling as soil carbon, forest management, agroforestry or wetland management (Humpenöder et al. 2020) which have the potential to alter the contribution of land-based mitigation in terms of timing, potential and sustainability consequences (Frank et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch07_7.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In most of the assessed mitigation pathways, the AFOLU sector is of great importance for climate change mitigation as it (i) turns from a source into a sink of atmospheric CO2 due to large-scale afforestation and reforestation, (ii) provides high amounts of biomass for bioenergy with or without CCS and (iii), even under improved agricultural management, still causes residual non-CO2 emissions from agricultural production and (iv) interplays with sustainability dimensions other than climate action (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2017; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Frank et al. 2018; Hasegawa et al. 2018; van Soest et al. 2019). Regional AFOLU GHG emissions in scenarios with <4°C warming in 2100 (scenario category C7), as shown in Figure 7.13, are shaped by considerable CH4 and N2O emissions throughout 2050 and 2100, mainly from ASIA and AFRICA. CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation are largely caused by ASIA, followed by AFRICA, while CH4 emissions from paddy rice production are almost exclusively caused by ASIA. N2O emissions from animal waste management and soils are more equally distributed across region."

In particular, the reduction of CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation in ASIA and AFRICA is profound. Land-related CO2 emissions, which include emissions from deforestation as well as removals from afforestation, are slightly negative (i.e., AFOLU systems turn into a sink) in <1.5°C, <2°C and <3°C mitigation pathways compared to <4°C scenarios.

Land for dedicated second generation bioenergy crops and afforestation displace agricultural land for food production (cropland and pasture) and other natural land. For instance, in the <1.5°C mitigation pathway in ASIA, bioenergy and forest area together increased by about 2.1 million km 2 between 2020 and 2100, mostly at the cost of cropland and pasture (median values). Such large-scale transformations of land use have repercussions on biogeochemical cycles (e.g., fertiliser and water) but also on the economy (e.g., food prices) and potential socio-political conditions."

wg3_ch07_7.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"For different models and scenarios from the AR6 database, the amount of mitigated emissions is presented together with the respective carbon price (Figure 7.15). To determine mitigation potentials, scenarios are compared to a benchmark scenario which usually assumes business-as-usual trends and no explicit additional mitigation efforts. Scenarios have been excluded, if they do not have an associated benchmark scenario or fail the vetting according to the AR6 scenario database, or if they do not report carbon prices and CO2 emissions from AFOLU. Scenarios with contradicting assumptions (for example, fixing some of the emissions to baseline levels) are excluded. Furthermore, only scenarios with consistent 3  regional and global level results are considered. Mitigation potentials are computed by subtracting scenario specific emissions and sequestration amounts from their respective benchmark scenario values. This difference accounts for the mitigation that can be credited to the carbon price which is applied in a scenario. A few benchmark scenarios, however, apply already low carbon prices. For consistency reasons, a carbon price that is applied in a benchmark scenario is subtracted from the respective scenario specific carbon price. This may generate a bias because low carbon prices tend to have a stronger marginal impact on mitigation than high carbon prices. Scenarios with carbon prices which become negative due to the correction are not considered. The analysis considers all scenarios from the AR6 database which pass the criteria and should be considered as an ensemble of opportunity (Huppmann et al. 2018)."

Furthermore, indirect emission changes and interactions with other sectors can be highly relevant (Daioglou et al. 2019; Kalt et al. 2020) and are also accounted for in the presented potentials. Hereby, some sequestration efforts can occur in other sectors, while leading to less mitigation in the AFOLU sector. For instance, as an integral part of many scenarios, BECCS deployment will lead to overall emissions reductions, and even provision of CDR as a result of the interplay between three direct components (i) LULUCF emissions/sinks, (ii) reduction of fossil fuel use/emissions, (iii) carbon capture and sequestration. Since the latter two effects can compensate for the LULUCF effect, BECCS deployment in ambitious stabilisation scenarios may lead to reduced sink/increased emissions in LULUCF (Kalt et al. 2020). The same holds for trade-offs between carbon sequestration in forests versus harvested wood products both for enhancing the HWP pool and for material substitution. The strengths of the competition between biomass use and carbon sequestration will depend on the biomass feedstocks considered (Lauri et al. 2019)."

MACCs consider only technological mitigation options, integrated assessments typically include also demand side response to the carbon price and GHG efficiency improvements through structural change and international trade. These additional mitigation options can represent more than 60% of the total non-CO2 mitigation potential in the agricultural sector, where they are more important in the livestock sector, and thus the difference between sectoral and integrated assessments is more pronounced for the CH4 emissions (Frank et al. 2019)."

wg3_ch07_7.5.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Land use is at the centre of the interdependencies with other sectors, including energy. Some models see a strong competition between BECCS deployment with its respective demand for biomass, and CO2 mitigation/sequestration potentials in the land sector. Biomass demand may lead to an increase in CO2 emissions from land use despite the application of a carbon price when land-use expansion for dedicated biomass production, such as energy plantations, comes from carbon rich land use/land cover alternatives, or when increased extraction of biomass from existing land uses, such as forest management, leads to reduction of the carbon sink (Daioglou 2019; Luderer et al. 2018) and can explain the high variety of observations in some cases. Overall, the large variety of observations shows a large variety of plausible results, which can go back to different model structures and assumptions, showing a robust range of plausible outcomes (Kriegler et al. 2015)."

Selected SDGs are found to have positive synergies for AFOLU GHG abatement and to consistently decrease GHG emissions for both agriculture and forestry, thereby allowing for even more rapid and deeper emissions cuts. In particular, the decreased consumption of animal products and less food waste (SDG 12), and the protection of high biodiversity ecosystems such as primary forests (SDG 15) deliver high synergies with GHG abatement. On the other hand, protection of highly biodiverse ecosystems from conversion (SDG 15) limits the global biomass potentials for bioenergy (Frank et al. 2021), and while several forestry measures enhancing woody biomass supply for bioenergy may have synergies with improving ecosystems conditions, many represent a threat to biodiversity (Camia et al. 2020) (Sections 7.6.5 and 17.3.3.7, Figure 17.1 and Supplementary Material Table 17.SM.1)."

For consistency this chapter discusses IMPs as described in detail in chapters 1 and 3 of this report but focusing on the land-use sector. All pathways are assessed by different IAM realisations and do not only reduce GHG emissions but also use CDR options, whereas the amount and timing varies across pathways, as do the relative contributions of different land-based CDR options."

This pathway shows a strong decrease of CO2 emissions from land-use change in 2030, mainly due to reduced deforestation, as well as moderately decreasing N2O and CH4 emissions from agricultural production due to improved agricultural management and dietary shifts away from emissions-intensive livestock products. However, in contrast to CO2 emissions, which turn net-negative around 2050 due to afforestation/reforestation, CH4 and N2O emissions persist throughout the century due to difficulties of eliminating these residual emissions based on existing agricultural management methods (Frank et al. 2017; Stevanović et al. 2017). Comparably small amounts of BECCS are applied by the end of the century. Forest area increases at the cost of other natural vegetation."

Consequently, all GHG emission reductions as well as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS-based CDR start earlier in time at a higher rate of deployment. However, in contrast to CO2 emissions, which turn net-negative around 2030 due to afforestation/reforestation, CH4 and N2O emissions persist throughout the century, similar to ModAct , due to ongoing increasing demand for total calories and animal-based commodities (Bodirsky et al. 2020) and difficulties of eliminating these residual emissions based on existing agricultural management methods (Stevanović et al. 2017; Frank et al. 2017). In addition to abating land-related GHG emissions as well as increasing the terrestrial sink, this example also shows the potential importance of the land sector in providing biomass for BECCS and hence CDR in the energy sector. Cumulative CDR (2020–2100) amounts to 502 GtCO2 for BECCS and 121 GtCO2 for land-use change (including afforestation and reduced deforestation). In consequence, compared to ModAct  scenario ,  competition for land is increasing and much more other natural land as well as agricultural land (cropland and pasture land) is converted to forest or bioenergy cropland with potentially severe consequences for various sustainability dimensions such as biodiversity (Hof et al. 2018) and food security (Fujimori et al. 2019)."

Even under the more ambitious climate change mitigation target (1.5°C with no or low overshoot (OS), C1), the high share of renewable energy in IMP Ren strongly reduces the need for large-scale land-based CDR, which is reflected in smaller bioenergy and afforestation areas compared to IMP Neg-2.0. However, CH4 and N2O emissions from AFOLU persist throughout the century, similar to ModAct  scenario and IMP Neg-2.0."
wg3_ch07_7.5.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"In contrast to IMPs Neg-2.0 and Ren, IMP SP (Soergel et al. 2021; 1.5°C with no or low OS, C1) displays a future of generally low resource and energy consumption (including healthy diets with low animal-calorie shares and low food waste) as well as significant but sustainable agricultural intensification in combination with high levels of nature protection. This pathway shows a strong near-term decrease of CO2 emissions from land-use change, mainly due to reduced deforestation, and in difference to all other IMPs described in this chapter strongly decreasing N2O and CH4 emissions from agricultural production due to improved agricultural management but also based on dietary shifts away from emissions-intensive livestock products as well as lower shares of food waste. In consequence, comparably small amounts of land are needed for land demanding mitigation activities such as BECCS and afforestation. In particular, the amount of agricultural land converted to bioenergy cropland is smaller compared to other mitigation pathways. Forest area increases either by regrowth of secondary vegetation following the abandonment of agricultural land or by afforestation/reforestation at the cost of agricultural land."
wg3_ch07_7.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since the establishment of the UNFCCC, international agencies, countries, sub-national units and NGO’s have developed policies to facilitate and encourage GHG mitigation within AFOLU (Figure 7.18). Early guidance and policies focused on developing GHG inventory methodology with some emphasis on afforestation and reforestation projects, but the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the Kyoto Protocol focused attention on emission reduction projects, mostly outside of AFOLU. As successive IPCC AR6 WGIII reports illustrated large potential for AFOLU mitigation, methods to quantify and verify carbon emission reductions emerged within several projects in the early 2000s, through both voluntary (e.g., the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX)) and regulated (e.g., New South Wales and California) markets. The CDM dedicated large attention to LULUCF, including dedicated methodologies and bodies. The reasons for limited uptake of CDM afforestation/reforestation projects were multiple and not limited to the regulatory constraints, but also due to the low abatement potential (poor cost/performance ratio) compared to other mitigation opportunities."

While there has been considerable focus on forest and agricultural project-based mitigation actions, national governments were encouraged to incorporate project-based approaches with other sectoral strategies in their Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) after 2012. NAMAs reflect the country’s proposed strategy to reduce net emissions across various sectors within their economy (e.g., forests or agriculture). More recently, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) indicate whether individual countries plan to use forestry and agricultural policies or related projects amongst a set of measures in other sectors, to reduce their net emissions as part of the Paris Agreement (e.g., Forsell et al. 2016; Fyson and Jeffery 2019)."

Some protocols have been revised multiple times, such as the USA State of California’s forest carbon protocol, which is in its fifth revision, with the latest in 2019 (see http://www.climateactionreserve.org/how/protocols/forest/). Credits from carbon registries feed into regulatory programs, such as the cap and trade programme in California, or voluntary offset markets (Hamrick and Gallant 2017a).

Over 20 countries and regions have adopted explicit carbon taxes on carbon emission sources and fossil fuels, however, the charges have not been applied to non-CO2 agricultural emissions (OECD 2021a). California may implement regulations on methane emissions from cattle, however, regulations if approved, will not go into effect until 2024. Institutional and trade-related barriers (e.g., leakage) likely will limit widespread implementation of taxes on emissions in the food sector globally. Many countries exempt purchases of fuels used in agricultural or fishery production from fuel or carbon taxes, thus lowering the effective tax rate imposed on those sectors (OECD 2021a). Furthermore, bioenergy, produced from agricultural products, agricultural waste, and wood is often exempted from explicit carbon taxes.

However, our summation of actually paid funds in Table 7.4 is much smaller than what is portrayed by Salzman et al. (2018). REDD+ may operate at the country level, or for specific programmes or forests within a country.

Evidence from the EU similarly suggests that payments for some agroenvironmental practices may be additional, while others are not (Chabé-Ferret and Subervie 2013). Other studies, in particular in Latin America where many PES programmes have been implemented, have found a wide range of estimates of effectiveness (e.g., Honey-Rosés et al. 2011; Robalino and Pfaff 2013; Alix-Garcia et al. 2015; Robalino et al. 2015; Mohebalian and Aguilar 2016; Jayachandran et al. 2017; Börner et al. 2017; Burivalova et al. 2019).

Enforcement of these regulations, among other approaches is credited with encouraging the large-scale reduction in deforestation and associated carbon emissions after 2004 (Nepstad et al. 2014).

wg3_ch07_7.6.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Set asides and protected areas have been a widely utilised approach for conservation, and according to (FAO 2020d), 726 Mha (18%) of forests are in protected areas globally. A review of land sparing and land sharing policies in developing countries indicated that most of them follow land sparing models, sometimes in combination with land sharing approaches. However, there is still no clear evidence of which policy provides the best results for ecosystem services provision, conservation, and livelihoods (Mertz and Mertens 2017). The literature contains a wide range of results on the effectiveness of protected areas to reduce deforestation (Burivalova et al. 2019), with studies suggesting that protected areas provide significant protection of forests (e.g., Blackman 2015), modest protection (Andam et al. 2008), as well as increases in deforestation (Blackman 2015) and possible leakage of harvesting to elsewhere (Kallio et al. 2018). An estimate of the contributions of protected areas to mitigation between 2000 and 2012, showed that in the tropics, PAs reduced carbon emissions from deforestation by 4.88 PgC, or around 29%, when compared to the expected rates of deforestation (Bebber and Butt 2017). In that study, the tropical Americas (368.8 TgC yr −1) had the largest contribution, followed by Asia (25.0 TgC yr −1) and Africa (12.7 TgC yr −1). The authors concluded that local factors had an important influence on the effectiveness of protected areas. For example, in the Brazilian Amazon, protected area effectiveness is affected by the government agency controlling the land (federal indigenous lands, federal PAs, and state PAs) (Herrera et al. 2019). Because protected areas limit not just land-use change, but also logging or harvesting non-timber forest products, they may be relatively costly approaches for forest conservation (medium confidence)."
wg3_ch07_7.6.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Community forest management (CFM)  allows less intensive use of forest resources, while at the same time providing carbon benefits by protecting forest cover. Community forest management provides property rights to communities to manage resources in exchange for their efforts to protect those resources. In many cases, the local communities are indigenous people who otherwise would have insecure tenure due to an advancing agricultural frontier or mining activity. Other examples are forest owner associations like those discussed in Box 7.8. According to the Rights and Resources Initiative (2018), the area of forests under community management increased globally by 152 Mha from 2002 to 2017, with over 500 Mha under community management in 2017. Studies have now shown that improved property rights with community forest management can reduce deforestation and increase carbon storage (Deininger and Minten 2002; Alix-Garcia et al. 2005; Alix-Garcia 2007; Bowler et al. 2012; Blackman 2015; Fortmann et al. 2017; Burivalova et al. 2019). Efforts to expand property rights, especially community forest management, have reduced carbon emissions from deforestation in tropical forests in the last two decades ( high confidence), although the extent of carbon savings has not been quantified globally."

Multiple policies have been enacted at national and supra-national levels to promote the use of bioenergy in the transport sector, and for bioelectricity production. Existing policies mandate or subsidise the production and use of bioenergy. In the past few years, policies have been proposed, put in place or updated in Australia (Renewable Energy Target), Brazil (RenovaBio, Nationally Determined Contribution), Canada (Clean Fuel Standard), China (Biodiesel Industrial Development Policy, Biodiesel Fuel Blend Standard), the European Union (Renewable Energy Directive II), the USA (Renewable Fuel Standards), Japan (FY2030), Russia (Energy Strategy Bill 2035), India (Revised National Policy on Biofuels), and South Africa (Biofuels Regulatory Framework)."
wg3_ch07_7.6.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"While current policies focus on bioenergy to decarbonise the energy system, some also contain provisions to minimise the potential environmental and social trade-offs from bioenergy production. For instance, the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED II) and US Renewable Energy Standard (US-RFS) assign caps on the use of biofuels, which are associated with indirect land-use change and food-security concerns. The Netherlands has a stringent set of 36 sustainability criteria to which the certified biomass needs to comply. The EU-RED II also sets a timeline for the complete phase-out of high-risk biofuels (Section 7.4.4)."
wg3_ch07_7.6.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Forest certification programs, such as Forest Sustainability Council (FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), are consumer driven, voluntary programmes that influence timber harvesting practices, and may reduce emissions from forest degradation with reduced impact logging and other approaches (medium confidence). Forest certification has expanded globally to over 440 Mha (Kraxner et al. 2017). As the area of land devoted to certification has increased, the amount of timber produced from certified land has increased. In 2018, FSC accounted for harvests of 427 million m 3 and jointly FSC and PEFC accounted for 689 million m 3 in 2016 or around 40% of total industrial wood production (FAO 2018c). There is evidence that reduced impact logging can reduce carbon losses in tropical regions (Pearson et al. 2014; Ellis et al. 2019). However, there is conflicting evidence about whether forest certification reduces deforestation (e.g., Blackman et al. 2018; Tritsch et al. 2020)."

The number of private commitments to reduce deforestation from supply chains has greatly increased in recent years, with at least 865 public commitments by 447 producers, processors, traders, manufacturers and retailers as of December, 2020 (New York Declaration on Forests 2021). Industry partnerships with NGOs, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), have become more widespread and visible in agricultural production. For example, RSPO certifies members all along the supply chain for palm oil and claims around 19% of total production. Similar sustainability efforts exist for many of the world’s major agricultural products, including soybeans, rice, sugar cane, and cattle."
wg3_ch07_7.6.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is evidence that the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an industry-NGO effort whereby large industry consumers agreed voluntarily not to purchase soybeans grown on land deforested after 2006, reduced deforestation in the legal Amazon (Nepstad et al. 2014; Gibbs et al. 2015). However, recent studies have shown that some deforestation from the Amazon was displaced to the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) region (Moffette and Gibbs 2021), which is a global hotspot for biodiversity, and has significant carbon stocks. These results illustrate the importance of broadening the scope of supply chain management to minimise or eliminate displacement (Lima et al. 2019). In addition, while voluntary efforts may improve environmental outcomes for a time, it is not clear that they are sufficient to deliver long-term reductions in deforestation, given the increases in deforestation that have occurred in the Amazon in recent years (Box 7.9). Voluntary efforts would be more effective at slowing deforestation if they present stronger linkages to regulatory or other approaches (Lambin et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch07_box-7.8_p1,NO_TITLE,"Summary of the case. Indigenous peoples include more than 5000 different peoples, with over 370 million people, in 70 countries on five continents (UNIPP 2012). For example, in Latin America and Caribbean, forests cover more than 80% of the area occupied by indigenous peoples (330 million hectares) (FAO and FILAC, 2021) which points to their critical role for forest governance (Garnett et al. 2018; Fa et al. 2020). The Menominee people (Wisconsin, USA) practice sustainable forestry on their reservation according to a land ethic integral to the tribal identity. The Tribe calls themselves ‘The Forest Keepers’, recognising that the connection of their future to the sustainable management of the forest that allowed the forest volume standing today to be higher than when timber harvesting began more than 160 years ago. Management practices are based on continuous forest inventories (Mausel et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch07_box-7.8_p2,NO_TITLE,"Introduction to the case. Forest management and timber harvesting operations began shortly after the Menominee Indian Reservation was created by treaty in 1854. The Menominee reservation sits on about 95,000 ha of land in Wisconsin that spans multiple forest types and is more diverse than adjacent forests. The collectively maintained reservation has 87% of its land under sustained yield forestry."
wg3_ch07_box-7.8_p3,NO_TITLE,"Case description. The Tribe, in the 19th century, had already mastered vegetation manipulation with fire, sustainable forestry, multiple-use, ecosystem, and adaptive management. The centrepiece of the Tribe’s economy has been its forest product industry, Menominee Tribal Enterprises (MTE) (Pecore 1992). A balance between growth and removals and continuous forest inventories (CFI) are central for forest management for the past 160 years, aiming not at very large volumes, but at very high-quality trees. During this same period, more than 2.3 billion board feet have been harvested from the same area, equivalent to 0.3 m 3 ha –1 yr –1."
wg3_ch07_box-7.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"Interactions and limitations. In 2013, the Menominee Tribe started a collaboration with the US Forest Service to implement climate adaptation measures. The Tribe actively works to reduce the risk of forest damage and decided to further promote diversity by planting tree seedlings adapted to a warming climate (https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/and-trees-will-last-forever). However, new challenges are related to increasing pressures on forest ecosystems such as non-native insects, pathogens, weed invasions, and the costs for continuous forest inventories to support long-term forest management."
wg3_ch07_box-7.8_p5,NO_TITLE,"Identified lessons. The elements of sustainability are intertwined with Menominee history, culture, spirituality, and ethics. The balance between the environment, community, and economy for the short term as well as future generations is an example of protecting the entire environment as the Menominee land is a non-fragmented remnant of the prehistoric Lake States forest which has been dramatically reduced all around the reserve (Schabel and Pecore 1997). These and other types of community forest owner associations exist all over the world. Examples are Södra in Sweden (with 52,000 forest owners) (Södra, 2021) or Waldbauernverband in North-Rhine Westphalia (with 150,000 forest owners and covering 585,000 ha) (AGDW-The Forest Owners, 2021). These are ways for small forest owners to educate, jointly put wood on the market, employ better forest management, use machinery together, and apply certification jointly. In this manner and with all their diversity of goals, they manage to maintain carbon sinks and stocks, while preserving biodiversity and producing wood."

A set of public policies designed in participatory process involving federal government, states, municipalities, and civil society successfully reduced deforestation rates until 2012. However, deforestation rates increased after 2013, and particularly between 2019 and 2020. Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by changes in environmental governance, weak law enforcement, and polarisation of the national politics."

wg3_ch07_box-7.9_p8,NO_TITLE,"Combating deforestation was a theme in several programs, government plans, and projects not being more restricted to the environmental agenda. This broader inclusion resulted from a long process of insertion and articulation in the government dating back to 2003 while elaborating on the Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, a historic meeting took place in an Amazonian city, with the president of the Republic, state governors, ministers, and various business leaders, civil institutions, and social movements. It was presented and approved the document entitled ‘Sustainable Amazonia – Guidelines and Priorities of the Ministry of Environment for the Sustainable Development of the Amazon Brazilian’, containing several guidelines for conservation and sustainable use in the region. At the meeting, the Union and some states signed a Cooperation Agreement aiming to elaborate a plan for the Amazon, to be widely discussed with the various sectors of the regional and national society (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013)."
wg3_ch07_box-7.9_p10,NO_TITLE,"The PPCDAm had three main lines of action: (i) territorial management and land use; (ii) command and control; and (iii) promotion of sustainable practices. During the execution of the 1st and 2nd phases of the PPCDAm (2004–2011), important results in the territorial management and land-use component included, for example, the creation of 25 Mha of federal Protected Areas (PAs) located mainly in front of the expansion of deforestation, as well as the homologation of 10 Mha of Indigenous Lands. Also, states and municipalities created approximately 25 Mha, so that all spheres of government contributed to the expansion of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon. In the ‘command and control’ component, agencies performed hundreds of inspection operations against illegal activities (e.g., illegal logging) under strategic planning based on technical and territorial priorities. Besides, there was a significant improvement of the environmental monitoring systems, involving the analysis of satellite images to guide actions on the ground. Another policy was the restriction of public credit to enterprises linked to illegal deforestation following a resolution of the Brazilian Central Bank (2008) (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013). Also, in 2008, Brazil created the Amazon Fund, a REDD+ mechanism (Government of Brazil, n.d.)."

Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by critical changes in the political context, and weakening the environmental rule of law, forest conservation, and sustainable development programmes (for example, changes in the Amazon Fund governance in disagreement with the main donors). In 2019, the annual deforestation rate reached 10,129 km 2 being the first time it surpassed 10,000 km 2 since 2008 (INPE, 2021). Besides, there has been no effective transition from the historical economic model to a sustainable one. The lack of clarity in the ownership of land is still a major unresolved issue in the Amazon."
wg3_ch07_box-7.9_p13,NO_TITLE,"The reduction of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was possible due to effective political and institutional support for environmental conservation. The initiatives of the Action Plan included the expansion of the protected areas network (conservation unities and indigenous lands), improvement of deforestation monitoring to the enforcement of environmental laws, and the use of economic instruments, for example, by cutting off public credit for municipalities with higher deforestation rates (Ricketts et al. 2010; Souza et al. 2013; Nepstad et al. 2014; Arima et al. 2014; Blackman and Veit 2018)."

wg3_ch07_box-7.10_p2,"Mitigation Effectiveness: Additionality, Permanence and Leakage ","More than 200 million trees have regenerated on more than 5 Mha in the Sahel (Sendzimir et al. 2011). The Maradi/Zinder region of Niger is the epicentre of experimentation and scale up. This vast geographic extent generates significant mitigation potential despite the relatively modest per unit area increase in carbon of about 0.4 MgC ha –1 a –1 (Luedeling and Neufeldt 2012). In addition to the carbon benefits, these agroforestry systems decrease erosion, provide animal fodder, recharge groundwater, generate nutrition and income benefits and act as safety nets for vulnerable rural households during climate and other shocks (Bayala et al. 2014, 2015; Binam et al. 2015; Sinare and Gordon 2015; Ilstedt et al. 2016)."
wg3_ch07_box-7.10_p4,"Mitigation Effectiveness: Additionality, Permanence and Leakage ","A mélange of factors contributed to regreening in the Sahel.

This policy shift was catalysed by greater regional autonomy resulting from economic decline and coincided with successful pilots and NGO-led experimentation, cash-for-work, and training efforts to support changes in land management (Sendzimir et al. 2011). Participation of farmers in planning and implementation helped align actions with local knowledge and goals as well as market opportunities."

Without planting new trees, FMNR is presumed to be cheaper than other approaches to restoration, though comparative economic analysis has yet to be conducted (Chomba et al. 2020). Relatively lower investment costs are believed to have contributed to the replication across the landscape. These factors worked together to contribute to a groundswell of action that affected rights, access, and use of local resources (Tougiani et al. 2009)."

Around USD0.7 billion yr –1 has been invested in land-based carbon offsets (Table 7.4), but as noted in Streck (2012), there is a large funding gap between these efforts and the scale of efforts necessary to meet 1.5 or 2.0°C targets outlined in SR1.5. As Box 7.12 discusses, forestry actions could achieve up to 5.8 GtCO2 yr –1 with costs rising from USD178 billion yr –1 to USD400 billion yr –1 by 2050. Over half of this investment is expected to occur in Latin America, with 13% in SE Asia and 17% in sub-Saharan Africa (Austin et al. 2020). Other studies have suggested that similar sized programmes are possible, although they do not quantify total costs (e.g., Griscom et al. 2017 ; Busch et al. 2019). The currently quantified efforts to reduce net emissions with forests and agricultural actions are helpful, but society will need to quickly ramp up investments to achieve carbon sequestration levels consistent with high levels of mitigation. Only 2.5% of climate mitigation funding goes to land-based mitigation options, an order of magnitude below the potential proportional contribution (Buchner et al. 2015)."

For example, the economic potential (available up to USD100 tCO2–1) for soil carbon sequestration in croplands is 1.9 (0.4–6.8) GtCO2 yr –1 (Section 7.4.3.1), however, less than 2% of the carbon in Table 7.4 is derived from soil carbon sequestration projects. While reductions in CH4 emissions due to enteric fermentation constitute a large share of potential agricultural mitigation reported in Section 7.4, agricultural CH4 emission reductions so far have been relatively modest compared to forestry sequestration. The protocols to quantify emission reductions in the agricultural sector are available and have been tested, and the main limitation appears to be the lack of available financing or the unwillingness to re-direct current subsidies (medium confidence)."

These reductions in emissions have typically resulted from policy innovations outside of the climate space, or market trends. For example, in the USA, there has been widespread adoption of conservation tillage in the last 30 years as a labour-saving crop management technique. In Europe, agricultural N2O and CH4 emissions have declined due to reductions in nutrient inputs and cattle numbers (Henderson et al. 2020). These reductions may be attributed to mechanism within the Common Agricultural Policy (Section 7.6.2.1), but could also be linked to higher nutrient prices in the 2000–2014 period. Other environmental policies could play a role, for example, efforts to reduce water pollution from phosphorus in The Netherlands, may ultimately reduce cattle numbers, also lowering CH4 emissions."

However, the investments in low-carbon agriculture in Brazil amounted only 2% of the total funds for conventional agriculture in 2019. Programmes on deforestation in Brazil had successes and failures, as described in Box 7.9. Indonesia has engaged in a wide range of programmes in the REDD+ space, including a moratorium implemented in 2011 to prevent the conversion of primary forests and peatlands to oil palm and logging concessions (Wijaya et al. 2017; Tacconi and Muttaqin 2019; Henderson et al. 2020).

These include efforts to reduce N2O emission, increase implementation of conservation agriculture, improve livestock management, and implement forestry and grassland practices, including agroforestry (Box 7.10). Within several of the NDCs, countries have explicitly suggested intensification as an approach to reduce emission in the livestock sector.

The presence of significant subsidy programmes intended to improve farmer welfare and rural livelihoods makes it more difficult to implement regulatory programmes aimed at reducing net emissions in agriculture, however, it may increase the potential to implement new subsidy programmes that encourage practices aimed at reducing net emissions (medium confidence). For instance, in the USA, crop insurance can influence both crop choices and land use (Miao et al. 2016; Claassen et al. 2017), both of which will affect emission trends.

The benefits of various natural climate solutions depend on a variety of spatially dependent issues as well as institutional factors, including their management status (managed or unmanaged systems), their productivity, opportunity costs, technical difficulty of implementation, local willingness to consider, property rights and institutions, among other factors. Biomass energy, as described elsewhere in this chapter and in (Cross-Working Group Box 3 in Chapter 12), is a potential example of an option with trade-offs that emerge when policies favour one type of mitigation strategy over another. Bioenergy production needs safeguards to limit negative impacts on carbon stocks on the land base as is already in place in the EU Renewable Energy Directive and several national schemes in Netherlands, UK and Denmark (Buchholz et al. 2016; Khanna et al. 2017; DeCicco and Schlesinger 2018; Favero et al. 2020). It is argued that a carbon tax on only fossil fuel derived emissions, may lead to massive deployment of bioenergy, although the effects of such a policy can be mitigated when combined with policies that encourage sustainable forest management and protection of forest carbon stocks as well as forest management certification ( high confidence) (Nabuurs et al. 2017, Baker et al. 2019 and Favero et al. 2020)."

Carbon sequestration policies, sustainable land management (forest and agriculture), and biomass energy policies can be complementary (Favero et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2019).

Opportunity costs are a critical component of AFOLU finance, and must be included in any estimate of the funds necessary to carry out projects. They are largest, as share of total costs, in forestry because they play a prominent role in achieving high levels of afforestation, avoided deforestation, and improved forest management. In case of increasing soil carbon in croplands through reduced tillage, there are often cost savings associated with increased residues because there is less effort tilling, but the carbon effects per hectare are also modest. There could, however, be small opportunity costs in cases where residues may otherwise be marketed to a biorefinery. The effect of reduced tillage on yields varies considerably across sites and crop types, but tends to enhance yields modestly in the longer-run."

In each case, the required investment is the same – the planting cost plus the net foregone returns of agricultural rents – even though a different entity pays the cost. Private entities that pay for carbon credits will also bear the direct costs of planting plus the opportunity costs. In the case of avoided deforestation, opportunity costs similarly must be paid to individual actors to avoid the deforestation."

However, changes in agricultural land use and degradation of natural resources (UNEP 2019; IPBES 2019b) suggests that not all of this intensification is sustainable. Although agricultural intensification has led to less GHG emissions compared to a scenario where that intensification had not taken place (Burney et al. 2010), absolute agriculture related emissions have continued to increase (Section 7.2). Active pursuit of SI was found to be expanding, with implementation on an increasing area, notably in developing countries (Pretty et al. 2018), yet regional agricultural area expansion at the expense of native habitat also continues in such regions (Section 7.3). Although there are specific examples of SI (Box 7.13) global progress in achieving SI is acknowledged as slow (Cassman and Grassini 2020) with potentially multiple, context specific geophysical and socio-economic barriers to implementation (Firbank et al. 2018; da Silva et al. 2021 )."

Both area- and product unit-based metrics are valid, relevant under different contexts and useful in approaching SI, but do not capture overall impacts and trade-offs (Garnett 2014).

wg3_ch07_7.6.3_p1, Socio-economic Barriers and Opportunities ,"The AR5 and other assessments have acknowledged many barriers and opportunities to effective implementation of AFOLU measures. Many of these barriers and opportunities focus on the context in developing countries, where a significant portion of the world’s cost-effective mitigation exists, but where domestic financing for implementation is likely to be limited. The SSPs capture some of this context, and as a result, IAMs (Section 7.5) exhibit a wide range of land-use outcomes, as well as mitigation potential. Potential mitigation, however, will be influenced by barriers and opportunities that are not considered by IAMs or by bottom-up studies reviewed here. For example, more efficient food production systems, or sustainable intensification within agriculture, and globalised trade could enhance the extent of natural ecosystems leading to lower GHG emissions from the land system and lower food prices (Popp et al. 2017), but this (or any) pathway will create new barriers to implementation and encourage new opportunities, negating potential benefits (Box 7.11). It is critically important to consider the current context in any country."

The lack of resources thus far committed to implementing AFOLU mitigation, income and access to alternative sources of income in rural households that rely on agriculture or forests for their livelihoods remains a considerable barrier to adoption of AFOLU ( high confidence). Section 7.6.1 illustrates that to date only USD0.7 billion yr –1 has been spent on AFOLU mitigation, well short of the more than USD400 billion yr –1 that would be needed to achieve the economic potential described in Section 7.4. Despite long-term recognition that AFOLU can play an important role in mitigation, the economic incentives necessary to achieve AFOLU aspirations as part of the Paris Agreement or to maintain temperatures below 2.0°C have not emerged. Without quickly ramping up spending, the lack of funding to implement projects remains a substantial barrier ( high confidence). Investments are critically important in the livestock sector, which has the highest emissions reduction potential among options because actions in the sector influence agriculture specific activities, such as enteric fermentation, as well as deforestation (Mayberry et al. 2019). In many countries with export-oriented livestock industries, livestock farmers control large swaths of forests or re-forestable areas. Incentive mechanisms and funding can encourage adoption of mitigation strategies, but funding is currently too low to make consistent progress."

The largest share of funding to date has been for REDD+, and many of the commitments to date suggest that there will be significant funding in this area for the foreseeable future. Funding for conservation programmes in OECD countries and China affects carbon, but has been driven by other objectives such as water quality and species protection. Considerably less funding has been available for agricultural projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and outside of voluntary markets, there do not appear to be large sources of funding emerging either through international organisations, or national programs. In the agricultural sector, funding for carbon must be obtained by redirecting existing resources from non-GHG conservation to GHG measures, or by developing new funding streams (Henderson et al. 2020)."

Most approaches to reduce emissions, especially in agriculture, require new or different technologies that involve significant time or financial investments by the implementing landholders.

The number of hungry and food insecure people in the world is growing, reaching 821 million in 2017, or one in every nine people (FAO 2018b), and two-thirds live in rural areas (Laborde Debucquet et al. 2020). Consideration of rural poverty and food insecurity is central in AFOLU mitigation because there are a large number of farms in the world (about 570 million), and most are smaller than 2 hectares.

AR6 presents new estimates of the mitigation potential for shifts in diets and reductions in food waste, but given long-standing dietary traditions within most cultures, some of the strongest barriers exist for efforts to change diets (medium confidence). Furthermore, the large number of undernourished who may benefit from increased calories and meat will complicate efforts to change diets. Regulatory or tax approaches will face strong resistance, while efforts to use educational approaches and voluntary measures have limited potential to slow changes in consumption patterns due to free-riders, rebound effects, and other limitations. Food loss and waste occurs across the supply chain, creating significant challenges to reduce it (FAO 2019c). Where food loss occurs in the production stage, in other words, in fields at harvest, there may be opportunities to align reductions in food waste with improved production efficiency, however, adoption of new production methods often requires new investments or changes in labour practices, both of which are barriers."

Governance challenges exist at all levels of government, with poor coordination, insufficient information sharing, and concerns over accountability playing a prominent role within REDD+ projects and programmes (Ravikumar et al. 2015). In some cases, governments are increasingly centralising REDD+ governance and limiting the distribution of governance functions between state and non-state actors (Zelli et al. 2017; Phelps et al. 2010).

While a considerable amount of land is certainly available for new forests or new bioenergy crops, that land has current uses that will affect not only the costs, but also the willingness of current users or owners, to shift uses.

Section 7.6.1 illustrates that to date only USD0.7 billion yr –1 has been spent on AFOLU mitigation, well short of the more than USD400 billion yr –1 that would be needed to achieve the economic potential described in Section 7.4. Despite long-term recognition that AFOLU can play an important role in mitigation, the economic incentives necessary to achieve AFOLU aspirations as part of the Paris Agreement or to maintain temperatures below 2.0°C have not emerged. Without quickly ramping up spending, the lack of funding to implement projects remains a substantial barrier ( high confidence). Investments are critically important in the livestock sector, which has the highest emissions reduction potential among options because actions in the sector influence agriculture specific activities, such as enteric fermentation, as well as deforestation (Mayberry et al. 2019). In many countries with export-oriented livestock industries, livestock farmers control large swaths of forests or re-forestable areas. Incentive mechanisms and funding can encourage adoption of mitigation strategies, but funding is currently too low to make consistent progress."

The largest share of funding to date has been for REDD+, and many of the commitments to date suggest that there will be significant funding in this area for the foreseeable future. Funding for conservation programmes in OECD countries and China affects carbon, but has been driven by other objectives such as water quality and species protection. Considerably less funding has been available for agricultural projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and outside of voluntary markets, there do not appear to be large sources of funding emerging either through international organisations, or national programs. In the agricultural sector, funding for carbon must be obtained by redirecting existing resources from non-GHG conservation to GHG measures, or by developing new funding streams (Henderson et al. 2020)."

Most approaches to reduce emissions, especially in agriculture, require new or different technologies that involve significant time or financial investments by the implementing landholders.

Mitigation and adaptation can have important implications for vulnerable people and communities, for example, mitigation activities consistent with scenarios examined in the SR1.5 could raise food and fiber prices globally (Section. 7.5). In the NDCs, 82 Parties included references to social issues (e.g., poverty, inequality, human well-being, marginalisation), with poverty the most cited factor (70 Parties). The number of hungry and food insecure people in the world is growing, reaching 821 million in 2017, or one in every nine people (FAO 2018b), and two-thirds live in rural areas (Laborde Debucquet et al. 2020). Consideration of rural poverty and food insecurity is central in AFOLU mitigation because there are a large number of farms in the world (about 570 million), and most are smaller than 2 hectares. It is important to better understand how different mitigation policies affect the poor."
wg3_ch07_7.6.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Cultural values and social acceptance. Barriers to adoption of AFOLU mitigation will be strongest where historical practices represent long-standing traditions ( high confidence). Adoption of new mitigation practices, however, may proceed quickly if the technologies can be shown to improve crop yields, reduce costs, or otherwise improve livelihoods (Ranjan 2019). AR6 presents new estimates of the mitigation potential for shifts in diets and reductions in food waste, but given long-standing dietary traditions within most cultures, some of the strongest barriers exist for efforts to change diets (medium confidence). Furthermore, the large number of undernourished who may benefit from increased calories and meat will complicate efforts to change diets. Regulatory or tax approaches will face strong resistance, while efforts to use educational approaches and voluntary measures have limited potential to slow changes in consumption patterns due to free-riders, rebound effects, and other limitations. Food loss and waste occurs across the supply chain, creating significant challenges to reduce it (FAO 2019c). Where food loss occurs in the production stage, in other words, in fields at harvest, there may be opportunities to align reductions in food waste with improved production efficiency, however, adoption of new production methods often requires new investments or changes in labour practices, both of which are barriers."
wg3_ch07_7.6.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Transparent and accountable governance. Good governance and accountability are crucial for implementation of forest and agriculture mitigation. Effective nature-based mitigation will require large-scale estimation, modelling, monitoring, reporting and verification of GHG inventories, mitigation actions, as well as their implications for sustainable development goals and their interactions with climate change impacts and adaptation. Efforts must be made to integrate the accounting from projects to the country level. While global datasets have emerged to measure forest loss, at least temporarily (e.g., Hansen et al. 2013), similar datasets do not yet exist for forest degradation and agricultural carbon stocks or fluxes. Most developing countries have insufficient capacity to address research needs, modelling, monitoring, reporting and data requirements (Ravindranath et al. 2017), compromising transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability."

Governance challenges exist at all levels of government, with poor coordination, insufficient information sharing, and concerns over accountability playing a prominent role within REDD+ projects and programmes (Ravikumar et al. 2015). In some cases, governments are increasingly centralising REDD+ governance and limiting the distribution of governance functions between state and non-state actors (Zelli et al. 2017; Phelps et al. 2010). Overlap and duplication in Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) and REDD+ also limits governance effectiveness (Gupta et al. 2016)."

Some positive signs exist as over 500 million hectares of forests have been converted to community management with clear property rights in the past two decades (Rights and Resources Initiative 2018), but adoption of forest and agricultural mitigation practices will be limited in large remaining areas with unclear property rights (Gupta et al. 2016)."

Climate mitigation scenarios in the two recent special reports (SR1.5 and SRCCL) that aim to limit global temperature increase to 2°C or less involve carbon dioxide (CO2) removal from the atmosphere. To support large-scale CDR, these scenarios involve significant land-use change, due to afforestation/reforestation, avoided deforestation, and deployment of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While a considerable amount of land is certainly available for new forests or new bioenergy crops, that land has current uses that will affect not only the costs, but also the willingness of current users or owners, to shift uses. Regions with private property rights and a history of market-based transactions may be the most feasible for land-use change or land management change to occur. Areas with less secure tenure or a land market with fewer transactions in general will likely face important hurdles that limit the feasibility of implementing novel nature-based solutions."

Afforestation can have minor to severe consequences for surface water acidification, depending on site-specific factors and exposure to air pollution and sea-salts (Futter et al. 2019).

Their results suggest that while there is large potential for afforestation and reforestation, the carbon uptake potential in land-based climate change mitigation efforts is highly dependent on the assumptions related to climate drivers, land use and land management, and soil carbon responses to land-use change. Less analysis has been conducted on bioenergy crop yields, however, bioenergy crop yields are also likely to be highly variable, suggesting that bioenergy supply could exceed or fall short of expectations in a given region, depending on site conditions."

While the terrestrial sink relies on regrowth in secondary forests (Houghton and Nassikas 2017), there is emerging evidence that the sink will slow in the Northern Hemisphere as forests age (Nabuurs et al. 2013), although saturation may take decades (Zhu et al. 2018). Forest management through replanting, variety selection, fertilisation, and other management techniques, has increased the terrestrial carbon sink over the last century (Mendelsohn and Sohngen 2019). Saturation of the sink in situ may not occur when, for example, substitution effects of timber usage are also considered."

However, it is uncertain if this large terrestrial carbon sink will continue in the future (Aragão et al. 2018), as it is increasingly recognised that gains due to CO2 fertilisation are constrained by climate and increasing disturbances (Schurgers et al. 2018; Duffy et al. 2021) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 5). Further, negative synergies between local impacts like deforestation and forest fires may interact with global drivers like climate change and lead to tipping points (Lovejoy and Nobre 2018). Factors that reduce permanence or slow forest growth will drive up costs of forest mitigation measures, suggesting that climate change presents a formidable challenge to implementation of nature-based solutions beyond 2030 (high confidence)."

Deployment of BECCS and forest-based mitigation can be complementary (Favero et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2019), but inefficient policy approaches could lead to net carbon emissions if BECCS replaces high-carbon content ecosystems with crops."

Forest management strategies based on biodiversity and ecosystems functioning interactions can augment the effectiveness of forests in reducing climate change impacts on ecosystem functioning ( high confidence).

Such losses will not only affect current economic growth but also impede the capacity for future economic growth."
wg3_ch07_7.6.5_p2,Ecosystem Services ,"Population growth, economic development, urbanisation, technology, climate change, global trade and consumption, policy and governance are key drivers of global environmental change over recent decades (Kram et al. 2014; UNEP 2019; WWF 2020). Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services are mainly driven by habitat loss, climate change, invasive species, over-exploitation of natural resources, and pollution (Millenium Ecosystem Assesment 2005). The relative importance of these drivers varies across biomes, regions, and countries. Climate change is expected to be a major driver of biodiversity loss in the coming decades, followed by commercial forestry and bioenergy production (OECD 2012; UNEP 2019). Population growth along with rising incomes and changes in consumption and dietary patterns, will exert immense pressure on land and other natural resources (IPCC 2019). Current estimates suggest that 75% of the land surface has been significantly anthropogenically altered, with 66% of the ocean area experiencing increasing cumulative impacts and over 85% of wetland area lost (IPBES 2019a). As discussed, in Section 7.3, land-use change is driven amongst others by agriculture, forestry (logging and fuelwood harvesting), infrastructural development and urbanisation, all of which may also generate localised air, water, and soil pollution (IPBES 2019a). Over a third of the world’s land surface and nearly three-quarters of available freshwater resources are devoted to crop or livestock production (IPBES 2019a). Despite a slight reduction in global agricultural area since 2000, regional agricultural area expansion has occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East (FAO 2019c; OECD and FAO 2019). The degradation of tropical forests and biodiversity hotspots, endangers habitat for many threatened and endemic species, and reduces valuable ecosystem services. However, trends vary considerably by region. As noted in Section 7.3, global forest area declined by roughly 178 Mha between 1990 and 2020 (FAO 2020a), though the rate of net forest loss has decreased over the period, due to reduced deforestation in some countries and forest gains in others. Between 1990 to 2015, forest cover fell by almost 13% in South-East Asia, largely due to an increase in timber extraction, large-scale biofuel plantations and expansion of intensive agriculture and shrimp farms, whereas in North-East Asia and South Asia it increased by 23% and 6% respectively, through policy instruments such as joint forest management, payment for ecosystem services, and restoration of degraded forests (IPBES 2018b). It is lamenting that the area under natural forests which are rich in biodiversity and provide diverse ecosystem services decreased by 301 Mha between 1990 and 2020, decreasing in most regions except Europe and Oceania with largest losses reported in sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 2020a). The increasing trend of mining in forest and coastal areas, and in river basins for extracting has had significant negative impacts on biodiversity, air and water quality, water distribution, and on human health (Section 7.3). Freshwater ecosystems equally face a series of combined threats including from land-use change, water extraction, exploitation, pollution, climate change and invasive species (IPBES 2019a)."

The value of global agricultural output (over USD3.54 trillion in 2018) had increased approximately threefold since 1970, and roundwood production (industrial roundwood and fuelwood) by 27%, between 1980 to 2018, reaching some 4 billion m 3 in 2018. However, the positive trends in these four ecosystem services does not indicate long-term sustainability. If increases in agricultural production are realised through forest clearance or through increasing energy-intensive inputs, gains are likely to be unsustainable in the long run. Similarly, an increase in fish production may involve overfishing, leading to local species declines which also impacts fish prices, fishing revenues, and the well-being of coastal and fishing communities (Sumaila and Lam 2020). Climate change and other drivers are likely to affect future fish catch potential, although impacts will differ across regions (Sumaila et al. 2017; Domke et al. 2019)."

wg3_ch07_7.6.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Currently, land degradation is estimated to have reduced productivity in 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between USD235 billion and USD577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk because of pollinator loss (IPBES 2019a). The global trends reviewed above are based on data from 2000 studies. It is not clear whether the assessment included a quality control check of the studies evaluated and suffer from aggregation bias. For instance, a recent meta-analysis of global forest valuation studies noted that many studies reviewed had shortcomings such as failing to clearly mention the methodology and prices used to value the forest ecosystem services, double counting, data errors, and so on (Ninan and Inoue 2013). Furthermore, the criticisms against the paper by (Costanza et al. 1997), such as ignoring ecological feedbacks and non-linearities that are central to the processes that link all species to each other and their habitats, ignoring substitution effects may also apply to the global assessment (Smith 1997; Bockstael et al. 2000; Loomis et al. 2000). Land degradation has had a pronounced impact on ecosystem functions worldwide (IPBES 2018e). Net primary productivity of ecosystem biomass and of agriculture is presently lower than it would have been under a natural state on 23% of the global terrestrial area, amounting to a 5% reduction in total global net primary productivity  (IPBES 2018e). Over the past two centuries, soil organic carbon, an indicator of soil health, has seen an estimated 8% loss globally (176 GtC) from land conversion and unsustainable land management practices (IPBES 2018e). Projections to 2050 predict further losses of 36 GtC from soils, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These losses are projected to come from the expansion of agricultural land into natural areas (16 GtC), degradation due to inappropriate land management (11 GtC) and the draining and burning of peatlands (9 GtC) and melting of permafrost  (IPBES 2018e). Trends in biodiversity measured by the global living planet index between 1970 to 2016 indicate a 68% decline in monitored population of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish (WWF 2020). FAO’s recent report on the state of the world’s biodiversity for food and agriculture points to an alarming decline in biodiversity for food and agriculture including associated biodiversity such as pollination services, microorganisms which are essential for production systems (FAO 2019d). These suggest that overall ecosystem health is consistently declining with adverse consequences for good quality of life, human well-being, and sustainable development."

The few studies that have assessed the trends in the value of ecosystem services provided by different ecosystems across regions and countries indicate a declining trend (Costanza et al. 2014; Kubiszewski et al. 2017). Land-use change is a major driver behind loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in most regions (IPBES 2018b; IPBES 2018c, IPBES 2018d, Rice et al. 2018). Projected impacts of land-use change and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (material and regulating services) between 2015 to 2050 were assessed to have relatively less negative impacts under global sustainability scenarios as compared to regional competition and economic optimism scenarios (IPBES 2019a). The projected impacts were based on a subset of Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and GHG emissions trajectories (RCP) developed in support of IPCC assessments. There are synergies, trade-offs and co-benefits between ecosystem services and mitigation options with impacts on ecosystem services differing by scale and contexts ( high confidence). Measures such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, soil and water conservation, afforestation, adoption of silvopastoral systems, can help minimise trade-offs between mitigations options and ecosystem services (Duguma et al. 2014). Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is being promoted to enable farmers to make agriculture more sustainable and adapt to climate change (Box 7.4). However, experience with CSA in Africa has not been encouraging. For instance, a study of climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana shows that due to lack of tenure (tree) rights, bureaucratic and legal hurdles in registering trees in cocoa farms, and other barriers small cocoa producers could not realise the project benefits (Box 7.13). Experience of CSA in some other sub-Saharan African countries and other countries such as Belize too has been constrained by weak extension systems and policy implementation, and other barriers (Arakelyan et al. 2017; Kongsager 2017)."

However, we are aware of the inadequacies of traditional GDP as an indicator of well-being. In this context the Dasgupta Biodiversity Review argues for using the inclusive wealth approach to accurately measure social well-being by tracking the changes in produced, human and natural capital (Dasgupta 2021).

Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2°C scenario, improved management of land and more efficient forest practices, a reduction in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015–2050 (Keramidas et al. 2018). If managed and regulated appropriately, the Land sector could become carbon-neutral as early as 2030–2035, being a key sector for emissions reductions beyond 2025 (Keramidas et al. 2018). Nature-based solutions (NBS) with safeguards has immense potential for cost-effective adaptation to climate change; but their impacts will vary by scale and contexts ( high confidence). Griscom et al. 2017 estimate this potential to provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation until 2030 needed to meet 2°C goals with likely co-benefits for biodiversity.

wg3_ch07_7.6.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Currently, land degradation is estimated to have reduced productivity in 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between USD235 billion and USD577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk because of pollinator loss (IPBES 2019a). The global trends reviewed above are based on data from 2000 studies. It is not clear whether the assessment included a quality control check of the studies evaluated and suffer from aggregation bias. For instance, a recent meta-analysis of global forest valuation studies noted that many studies reviewed had shortcomings such as failing to clearly mention the methodology and prices used to value the forest ecosystem services, double counting, data errors, and so on (Ninan and Inoue 2013). Furthermore, the criticisms against the paper by (Costanza et al. 1997), such as ignoring ecological feedbacks and non-linearities that are central to the processes that link all species to each other and their habitats, ignoring substitution effects may also apply to the global assessment (Smith 1997; Bockstael et al. 2000; Loomis et al. 2000). Land degradation has had a pronounced impact on ecosystem functions worldwide (IPBES 2018e). Net primary productivity of ecosystem biomass and of agriculture is presently lower than it would have been under a natural state on 23% of the global terrestrial area, amounting to a 5% reduction in total global net primary productivity  (IPBES 2018e). Over the past two centuries, soil organic carbon, an indicator of soil health, has seen an estimated 8% loss globally (176 GtC) from land conversion and unsustainable land management practices (IPBES 2018e). Projections to 2050 predict further losses of 36 GtC from soils, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These losses are projected to come from the expansion of agricultural land into natural areas (16 GtC), degradation due to inappropriate land management (11 GtC) and the draining and burning of peatlands (9 GtC) and melting of permafrost  (IPBES 2018e). Trends in biodiversity measured by the global living planet index between 1970 to 2016 indicate a 68% decline in monitored population of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish (WWF 2020). FAO’s recent report on the state of the world’s biodiversity for food and agriculture points to an alarming decline in biodiversity for food and agriculture including associated biodiversity such as pollination services, microorganisms which are essential for production systems (FAO 2019d). These suggest that overall ecosystem health is consistently declining with adverse consequences for good quality of life, human well-being, and sustainable development."
wg3_ch07_7.6.5.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Although numerous studies have estimated the value of ecosystem services for different sites, ecosystems, and regions, these studies mostly evaluate ecosystem services at a single point in time (Costanza et al. 1997; Xue and Tisdell 2001; Nahuelhual et al. 2007; de Groot et al. 2012; Ninan and Kontoleon 2016). The few studies that have assessed the trends in the value of ecosystem services provided by different ecosystems across regions and countries indicate a declining trend (Costanza et al. 2014; Kubiszewski et al. 2017). Land-use change is a major driver behind loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in most regions (IPBES 2018b; IPBES 2018c, IPBES 2018d, Rice et al. 2018). Projected impacts of land-use change and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (material and regulating services) between 2015 to 2050 were assessed to have relatively less negative impacts under global sustainability scenarios as compared to regional competition and economic optimism scenarios (IPBES 2019a). The projected impacts were based on a subset of Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and GHG emissions trajectories (RCP) developed in support of IPCC assessments. There are synergies, trade-offs and co-benefits between ecosystem services and mitigation options with impacts on ecosystem services differing by scale and contexts ( high confidence). Measures such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, soil and water conservation, afforestation, adoption of silvopastoral systems, can help minimise trade-offs between mitigations options and ecosystem services (Duguma et al. 2014). Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is being promoted to enable farmers to make agriculture more sustainable and adapt to climate change (Box 7.4). However, experience with CSA in Africa has not been encouraging. For instance, a study of climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana shows that due to lack of tenure (tree) rights, bureaucratic and legal hurdles in registering trees in cocoa farms, and other barriers small cocoa producers could not realise the project benefits (Box 7.13). Experience of CSA in some other sub-Saharan African countries and other countries such as Belize too has been constrained by weak extension systems and policy implementation, and other barriers (Arakelyan et al. 2017; Kongsager 2017)."
wg3_ch07_7.6.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is part of the larger objective of building climate resilience and promoting good quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development. While two of the 17 SDGs directly relate to nature (SDGs 14 and 15 covering marine and terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity), most other SDGs relating to poverty, hunger, inequality, health and well-being, clean sanitation and water, energy, and so on, are directly or indirectly linked to nature (Blicharska et al. 2019). A survey among experts to assess how 16 ecosystem services could help in achieving the SDGs relating to good environment and human well-being suggested that ecosystem services could contribute to achieving about 41 targets across 12 SDGs (Wood et al. 2018). They also indicated cross-target interactions and synergetic outcomes across many SDGs. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is critical to sustaining the well-being and livelihoods of poor and marginalised people, and indigenous communities who depend on natural resources ( high confidence). Nature provides a broad array of goods and services that are critical to good quality of life and human well-being. Healthy and diverse ecosystems can play an important role in reducing vulnerability and building resilience to disasters and extreme weather events (SCBD 2009; The Royal Society Science Policy Centre 2014; Ninan and Inoue 2017)."

However, Reyers and Selig (2020) note that the assessment by (IPBES 2019a) could only assess the consequences of trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services for 35 out of the 169 SDG targets due to data and knowledge gaps, and lack of clarity about the relationship between biodiversity, ecosystem services and SDGs."
wg3_ch07_7.6.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Progress in achieving the 20 Aichi Biodiversity targets which are critical for realising the SDGs has been poor with most of the targets not being achieved or only partially realised (SCBD 2020). There could be synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and human well-being. For instance, a study notes that although policy interventions and incentives to enhance supply of provisioning services (e.g., agricultural production) have led to higher GDP, it may have an adverse effect on the regulatory services of ecosystems (Kirchner et al. 2015). However, we are aware of the inadequacies of traditional GDP as an indicator of well-being. In this context the Dasgupta Biodiversity Review argues for using the inclusive wealth approach to accurately measure social well-being by tracking the changes in produced, human and natural capital (Dasgupta 2021). Targets for nature (biodiversity and ecosystem services) should be refined so as to fit in with the metrics tracked by the SDGs (IPBES 2016; Rosa et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch07_7.6.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Combined mitigation and adaptation approaches have been highlighted throughout Section 7.4 regarding specific measures. Land-based mitigation and adaptation to the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather events can have several co-benefits as well as help promote development and conservation goals. Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2°C scenario, improved management of land and more efficient forest practices, a reduction in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015–2050 (Keramidas et al. 2018). If managed and regulated appropriately, the Land sector could become carbon-neutral as early as 2030–2035, being a key sector for emissions reductions beyond 2025 (Keramidas et al. 2018). Nature-based solutions (NBS) with safeguards has immense potential for cost-effective adaptation to climate change; but their impacts will vary by scale and contexts ( high confidence). Griscom et al. 2017 estimate this potential to provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation until 2030 needed to meet 2°C goals with likely co-benefits for biodiversity. However, due to the time lag for technology deployment and natural carbon gain this mitigation potential of NBS by 2030 or 2050 can be delayed or much lower than the estimated potential (Qin et al. 2021)."

The shade tree seedlings were distributed by NGOs, government extension agencies, and the private sector free of charge or at subsidised prices and was expected to reduce pressure on forests for growing cocoa plants. The CSC programme was mainly targeted at small farmers who constitute about 80% of total farm holdings in Ghana. Although the government extension agency (Cocobod) undertook mass spraying or pruning of cocoa farms they found it difficult to access the 800,000 cocoa smallholders spread across the tropical south of the country. The project brought all stakeholders together, in other words, the government, private sector, local farmers and civil society or NGOs to facilitate the sustainable intensification of cocoa production in Ghana. Creation of a community-based governance structure was expected to promote benefit sharing, forest conservation, adaptation to climate change, and enhanced livelihood opportunities."
wg3_ch07_box-7.13_p9,NO_TITLE,"The role assigned to local government mechanisms such as Ghana’s Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) was expected to give a voice to smallholders who are an important stakeholder in Ghana’s cocoa sector. CREMAs are inclusive because authority and ownership of natural resources are devolved to local communities who can thus have a voice in influencing CSC policy thereby ensuring equity and adapting CSC to local contexts. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of CREMAs will help to make them a reliable mechanism for farmers to voice their concerns and aspirations, and ensure their independence as a legitimate governance structure in the long run. The private sector was assigned an important role to popularise climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana. However, whether this will work to the advantage of smallholder cocoa producers needs to be seen."

wg3_ch07_box-7.13_p11,NO_TITLE,"The policy intervention overlooks the institutional constraints characteristic of the cocoa sector in Ghana where small farmers are dominant and have skewed access to resources and markets. Lack of secure tenure (tree rights) where the ownership of shade trees and timber vests with the state, bureaucratic and legal hurdles to register trees in their cocoa farms are major constraints that impede realisation of the expected benefits of the CSC programme. This is a great disincentive for small cocoa producers to implement CSC initiatives and nurture the shade tree seedlings and undertake land improvement measures. The state marketing board has the monopoly in buying and marketing of cocoa beans including exports which impeded CREMAs or farming communities from directly selling their produce to MNCs and traders. However, many MNCs have been involved in setting up of CREMA or similar structures, extending premium prices and non-monetary benefits (access to credit, shade tree seedlings, agrochemicals) thus indirectly securing their cocoa supply chains. A biased ecological discourse about the benefits of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable intensive narrative, complexities regarding the optimal shade levels for growing cocoa, and dependence on agrochemicals are issues that affect the success and sustainability of the project intervention. Dominance of private sector players especially MNCs in the sector may be detrimental to the interests of smallholder cocoa producers (Nasser et al. 2020)."
