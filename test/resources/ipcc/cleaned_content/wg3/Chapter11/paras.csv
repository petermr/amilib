Reduced materials demand, material efficiency, and circular economy solutions can reduce the need for primary production. Primary production options include switching to new processes that use low to zero GHG energy carriers and feedstocks (e.g., electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) for carbon feedstock), and carbon capture and storage (CCS) for remaining CO2. These options require substantial scaling up of electricity, hydrogen, recycling, CO2, and other infrastructure, as well as phase-out or conversion of existing industrial plants. While improvements in the GHG intensities of major basic materials have nearly stagnated over the last 30 years, analysis of historical technology shifts and newly available technologies indicate these intensities can be reduced to net zero emissions by mid-century. {11.2, 11.3, 11.4}"

The character of these interventions (e.g., appearing in many forms across complex value chains, making cost estimates difficult) combined with the limited data on new fossil-free primary processes help explain why they are less represented in models than, for example, CCS. As a result, overall mitigation costs and the need for CCS may be overestimated. {11.4.2.1}"

Electricity is a versatile energy carrier, potentially produced from abundant renewable energy sources or other low carbon options; regional resources and preferences will vary. Using electricity directly, or indirectly via hydrogen from electrolysis for high temperature and chemical feedstock requirements, offers many options to reduce emissions.

Costs and emissions reductions potential in industry, and especially heavy industry, are highly contingent on innovation, commercialisation, and market uptake policy. Technologies exist to take all industry sectors to very low or zero emissions but require 5 to 15 years of intensive innovation, commercialisation, and policy to ensure uptake. Mitigation costs are in the rough range of USD50–150 tCO2-eq –1, with wide variation within and outside this band. This affects competitiveness and requires supporting policy. Although production cost increases can be significant, they translate to very small increases in the costs for final products, typically less than a few percent depending on product, assumptions, and system boundaries. {11.4.1.5}"

Material efficiency can potentially reduce steel demand by up to 40% based on design for less steel use, long life, reuse, constructability, and low contamination recycling. Secondary production through high quality recycling must be maximised. Production decarbonisation will also be required, starting with the retrofitting of existing facilities for partial fuel switching (e.g., to biomass or hydrogen), CCU and CCS, followed by very low and zero emissions production based on high-capture CCS or direct hydrogen, or electrolytic iron ore reduction followed by an electric arc furnace. {11.3.2, 11.4.1.1}"

Producer, user, and regulator education, as well as innovation and commercialisation policy are needed (medium confidence). Cement and concrete are currently overused because they are inexpensive, durable, and ubiquitous, and consumption decisions typically do not give weight to their production emissions. Basic material efficiency efforts to use only well-made concrete thoughtfully and only where needed (e.g., using right-sized, prefabricated components) could reduce emissions by 24–50% through lower demand for clinker. Cementitious material substitution with various materials (e.g., ground limestone and calcined clays) can reduce process calcination emissions by up to 50% and occasionally much more. Until a very low GHG emissions alternative binder to Portland cement is commercialised, which does not look promising in the near to medium term, CCS will be essential for eliminating the limestone calcination process emissions for making clinker, which currently represent 60% of GHG emissions in best available technology plants. {11.3.2, 11.3.6, 11.4.1.2}"

Fossil fuel-based feedstocks are inexpensive and still without carbon pricing, and their biomass- and electricity-based replacements will likely be more expensive. The chemical industry consumes large amounts of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, carbon monoxide, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes and aromatics from fossil feedstock, and from these basic chemicals produces tens of thousands of derivative end-use chemicals. Hydrogen, biogenic or air-capture carbon, and collected plastic waste for the primary feedstocks can greatly reduce total emissions. Biogenic carbon feedstock is likely to be limited due to competing land uses. {11.4.1.3}"

Pulp mills have access to biomass residues and by-products and in paper mills the use of process heat at low to medium temperatures allows for electrification (high confidence). Competition for feedstock will increase if wood substitutes for building materials and petrochemicals feedstock. The pulp and paper industry can also be a source of biogenic carbon dioxide and carbon for organic chemicals feedstock and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) using CCS. {11.4.1.4}

The potential for zero emission electricity and low-cost hydrogen from electrolysis powered by solar and wind, or hydrogen from other very low emission sources, may reshape where currently energy and emissions intensive basic materials production is located, how value chains are organised, trade patterns, and what gets transported in international shipping. Regions with bountiful solar and wind resources, or low fugitive methane co-located with CCS geology, may become exporters of hydrogen or hydrogen carriers such as methanol and ammonia, or home to the production of iron and steel, organic platform chemicals, and other energy-intensive basic materials. {11.2, 11.4 and Box 11.1}"

Energy efficiency is a well-established policy field with decades of experience from voluntary and negotiated agreements, regulations, energy auditing and demand side-management (DSM) programmes (see AR5). In contrast, materials demand management and efficiency are not well understood and addressed from a policy perspective. Barriers to recycling that policy could address are often specific to the different material loops (e.g., copper contamination for steel and lack of technologies or poor economics for plastics) or waste management systems. For electrification and fuel switching the focus has so far been mainly on innovation and developing technical supply-side solutions rather than creating market demand. {11.5.2, 11.6}"
wg3_ch11_executive-summary_p18,NO_TITLE,"Industry has so far largely been sheltered from the impacts of climate policy and carbon pricing due to concerns for competitiveness and carbon leakage (high confidence). New industrial development policy approaches needed for realising a transition to net zero GHG emissions are emerging. The transition requires a clear direction towards net zero, technology development, market demand for low-carbon materials and products, governance capacity and learning, socially inclusive phase-out plans, as well as international coordination of climate and trade policies. It requires comprehensive and sequential industrial policy strategies leading to immediate action as well as preparedness for future decarbonisation, governance at different levels (from international to local), and integration with other policy domains. {11.6}"
wg3_ch11_11.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 was published in 2014. The Paris Agreement and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015. An increasing number of countries have since announced ambitions to be carbon neutral by 2045–2060. The COVID-19 pandemic shocked the global economy in 2020 and motivated economic stimulus with demands for green recovery and concerns for economic security. All this has created a new context and a growing recognition that all industry, including the energy and emissions intensive industries, need to reach net zero GHG emissions. There is an ongoing mind shift around the opportunities to do so, with electrification and hydrogen emerging among key mitigation options as a result of renewable electricity costs falling rapidly. On the demand side there has been renewed attention to end-use demand, material efficiency, and more and better-quality recycling measures. This chapter takes its starting point in this new context and emphasises the need for deploying innovative processes and practices in order to limit the global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C (IPCC 2018a)."
wg3_ch11_11.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The industrial sector includes ores and minerals mining, manufacturing, construction and waste management. It is the largest source of global GHG and CO2 emissions, which include direct and indirect fuel-combustion-related emissions, emissions from industrial processes and products use, as well as from waste. This chapter is focused on heavy industry – the high temperature heat and process emissions intensive basic materials industries that account for 65% of industrial GHG and over 70% of industrial CO2 emissions (waste excluded), where deployment of near‐zero emissions technologies can be more challenging due to capital intensity and equipment lifetimes compared with other manufacturing industries. The transition of heavy industries to zero emissions requires supplementing the traditional toolkit of energy and process efficiency, fuel switching, electrification, and decarbonisation of power with material end-use demand management and efficiency, circular economy, fossil-free feedstocks, carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Energy efficiency was extensively treated in AR5 and remains a key mitigation option. This chapter is focused mainly on new options and developments since AR5, highlighting measures along the whole value chains that are required to approach zero emissions in primary materials production."
wg3_ch11_11.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Kaya identity offers a useful tool of decomposing emission sources and their drivers, as well as of weighing the mitigation options. The one presented below (Equation 11.1) builds on the previous assessments (IPCC 2014, 2018b; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), and reflect a material stock-driven services-oriented vision to better highlight the growing importance of industrial processes (dominated in emissions  increments in 2010–2019), product use and waste in driving emissions. Services delivery (nutrition, shelter, mobility, education, etc.; see Chapter 5 for more detail) not only requires energy and material flows (fuels, food, feed, fertilisers, packaging, etc.), but also material stocks (buildings, roads, vehicles, machinery, etc.), the mass of which has already exceeded 1000 Gt (Krausmann et al. 2018). As material efficiency appears to be an important mitigation option, material intensity or productivity (material extraction or consumption versus GDP (Oberle et al. 2019; Hertwich et al. 2020)) is reflected in the identity with two dimensions: as material stock intensity of GDP (tonnes per dollar) and material intensity of building and operating accumulated in-use stock. 1 For sub-global analysis the ratio of domestically used materials to total material production becomes important to reflect outsourced materials production and distinguish between territorial and consumption-based emissions. The identity for industry differs significantly from that for sectors with where combustion emissions dominate (Lamb et al. 2021)."

There are different ways to disaggregate Equation 11.1: by industrial subsectors (Bashmakov 2021); by reservoirs of material stock (buildings, infrastructure, vehicles, machinery and appliances, packaging, etc.); by regions and countries (where carbon leakage becomes relevant); by products and production chains (material extraction, production of basic materials, basic materials processing, production of final industrial products); by traditional and low carbon technologies used; and by stages of products’ lives including recycling."

Contributions from different drivers (energy efficiency, low carbon electricity and heat, material efficiency, switching to low carbon feedstock and CCUS) to this evolution vary with time. Energy efficiency dominates in the short- and medium term and potentially long term (in the range of 10–40% by 2050) (IPCC 2018a; Crijns-Graus et al. 2020; IEA 2020a), but for deep decarbonisation trajectories, contributions from the other drivers steadily grow, as the share of non-energy sources in industrial emissions rises and new technologies to address mitigation from these sources mature (Material Economics 2019; CEMBUREAU 2020; BP 2020; Hertwich et al. 2020, 2019; IEA 2021a, 2020a; Saygin and Gielen 2021) (Figure 11.1)."

Growing recycling allowed for replacement of some energy-intensive virgin materials and thus contributed to mitigation. In 2014–2019, a combination of these drivers allowed for a slowdown in the growth of industrial GHG emissions to below 1% (Figure 11.2 and Table 11.1), while to match a net zero emissions trajectory it should decline by 2% yr –1 in 2020–2030 and by 8.9% yr –1 in 2030–2050 (IEA 2021a)."

wg3_ch11_11.2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"There are two major concepts of material efficiency (ME). The broader one highlights demand reduction via policies promoting more intensive use, assuming sufficient (excluding luxury) living space or car ownership providing appropriate service levels – housing days or miles driven and life-time extension (Hertwich et al. 2019, 2020). This approach focuses on dematerialisation of society (Lechtenböhmer and Fischedick 2020), where a ‘dematerialisation multiplier’ (Pauliuk et al. 2021) limits both material stock and GDP growth, as progressively fewer materials are required to build and operate the physical in-use stock to deliver sufficient services. According to the IRP (2020), reducing floor space demand by 20% via shared and smaller housing compared to the reference scenario would decrease Group of Seven (G7) countries’ GHG emissions from the material-cycle of residential construction up to 70% in 2050. The narrower concept ignores demand and sufficiency aspects and focuses on supply chains considering ME as less basic materials use to produce a certain final product, for example, a car or a metre squared of living space (OECD 2019a; IEA 2020a). No matter if the broader or the narrower concept of ME is applied, in 1970–2019 it did not contribute much to the decoupling of industrial emissions from GDP. This is expected to change in the future (Figure 11.2)."
wg3_ch11_11.2.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Material efficiency analysis mostly uses material intensity or productivity indicators, which compare material extraction or consumption with GDP (Oberle et al. 2019; Hertwich et al. 2020). Those indicators are functions of material stock intensity of GDP (tonnes per dollar) and material intensity of building and operating accumulated in-use stock. Coupling services or GDP with the built stock allows for a better evaluation of demand for primary basic materials (Müller et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2013; Liu and Müller 2013; Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Cao et al. 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; Hertwich et al. 2020; Krausmann et al. 2020). Since 1970 material stock growth driven by industrialisation and urbanisation slightly exceeded that of GDP and there was no decoupling, 3  so in Kaya-like identities material stock may effectively replace GDP. There are different methods to estimate the former (see reviews in Pauliuk et al. (2015, 2019) and Wiedenhofer et al. (2019), the results of which are presented for major basic materials with some geographical resolution (Liu and Müller 2013; Pauliuk et al. 2013a) or globally (Graedel et al. 2011; Geyer et al. 2017; Krausmann et al. 2018; Pauliuk et al. 2019; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; International Aluminium Institute 2021a)."

In 1900–2019, the stock grew 31-fold, which is strongly coupled with GDP growth (36-fold). As the UK experience shows, material stock intensity of GDP may ultimately decline after services fully dominate GDP, and this allows for material productivity improvements to achieve absolute reduction in material use, as stock expansion slows down (Streeck et al. 2020). While the composition of basic materials within the stock of manufactured capital was evolving significantly, overall stock use associated with a unit of GDP has been evolving over the last half-century in a quite narrow range of 7.7–8.6 t per USD1000 (2017 purchasing power parity (PPP)) showing neither signs of decoupling from GDP, nor saturation as of yet. Mineral building materials (concrete, asphalt, bricks, aggregate, and glass) dominate the stock volume by mass (94.6% of the whole stock, with the share of concrete alone standing at 43.5%), followed by metals (3.5%) and solid wood (1.4%). The largest part of in-use stock of our ‘cementing societies’ (Cao et al. 2017) is constituted by concrete: about 417 Gt in 2015; Krausmann et al. (2018) extrapolated this to 478 Gt (65 tonnes per capita) in 2018, which contains about 88 Gt of cement. 4 The iron and steel stock is assessed at 25–35 Gt (Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; Gielen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021), while the plastics stock reached 2.5–3.2 Gt (Geyer et al. 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; Saygin and Gielen 2021) and the aluminium stock approached 1.1 Gt (International Aluminium Institute 2021a), or just 0.1% of the total. In sharp contrast to global energy intensity, which has more than halved since 1900 (Bashmakov 2019), in 2019 material stock intensity (in-use stock of manufactured capital per GDP) was only 14% below the 1900 level, but 15% above the 1970 level. In-use stock per capita has been growing faster than GDP per capita since 2000 (Figure 11.3). The growth rate of total in-use stock of manufactured capital was 3.8% in 1971–2000 and 3.5% in 2000–2019, or 32–35 Gt yr –1, to which concrete and aggregates contributed 88%. Recent demand for stockbuilding materials was 51–54 Gt yr –1, to which recycled materials recently contributed only about 10% of material input. About 46–49 Gt yr –1 was virgin inputs, which after accounting for processing waste and short-lived products (over 8 Gt yr –1) scale up to 54–58 Gt yr –1 of primary extraction (Krausmann et al. 2017, 2018; UNEP and IRP 2020).

Whatever metric is applied, industry (coal transformation, mining, quarrying, manufacturing and construction) driven mostly by material production, dominates global energy consumption. About two fifths of energy produced globally goes to industry, directly or indirectly. Direct energy use (including energy used in coal transformation) accounts for nearly 30% of total final energy consumption. When supplemented by non-energy use, the share for the post-AR5 period (2015–2019) stands on average close to 40% of final energy consumption, and at 28.5% of primary energy use. 13 With an account of indirect energy use for the generation of power and centralised heat to be consumed in industry, the latter scales up to 37%. Industrial energy use may be split by: material production and extraction (including coal transformation): 51% on average for 2015–2019; non-energy use (mostly chemical feedstock): 22%14 ; and other energy use (equipment, machinery, food and tobacco, textiles, leather, etc.): 27%.

Industrial energy use per tonne of extracted materials (ores and building materials as a proxy for materials going through the whole production chain to final products) fell by 20% in 2000–2019 and by 15% in 2010–2019, accelerated driven by high energy prices to 2.4% yr –1 in 2014–2019, matching the values observed back in 1990–2000 (Figure 11.2). Assessed per value added using market exchange rates, industrial energy intensity globally dropped by 12% in 2010–2018, after its 4% decline in 2000–2010, resulting in 2000–2018 decline by 15% (IEA 2020b,a). The 2020 COVID crisis slowed down energy intensity improvements by shifting industrial output towards more energy-intensive basic materials (IEA 2020e). Specific energy consumption per tonne of iron and steel, chemicals and cement production in 2019 was about 20% below the 2000 level (IEA 2020b,a). This progress is driven by moving towards best available technologies (BATs) for each product through new and highly efficient production facilities in China, India and elsewhere, and by the contribution from recycled scrap metals, paper and cardboard."
wg3_ch11_11.2.1_p18,NO_TITLE,"Physical energy intensity for the production of materials typically declines and then stabilises at the BAT level once the market is saturated, unless a transformative new technology enters the market (Gutowski et al. 2013; Crijns-Graus et al. 2020; IEA 2021a). Thus, the energy saving effect of switching to secondary used material comes to the forefront, as energy consumption per tonne for many basic primary materials approach the BATs. This highlights the need to push towards circular economy, materials efficiency, reduced demand, and fundamental process changes (e.g., towards electricity and hydrogen-based steel making). Improved recycling rates allow for a substantial reduction in energy use along the whole production chain – material extraction, production, and assembling – which is in great excess of energy used for collection, separation, treatment, and scrap recycling minus energy used for scrap landfilling. The International Energy Agency (IEA 2019b) estimates that by increasing the recycling content of fabricated metals, average specific energy consumption (SEC) for steel and aluminium may be halved by 2060. Focusing on whole systems ‘integrative design’ expands efficiency resource much beyond the sum of potentials for individual technologies. Material efficiency coupled with energy efficiency can deliver much greater savings than energy efficiency alone. Gonzalez Hernandez et al. (2018b) stress that presently about half of steel or aluminium are scrapped in production or oversized for targeted services. They show that resource efficiency expressed in exergy as a single metric for both material and energy efficiency for the global iron and steel sector is only 33%, while secondary steel-making is about twice as efficient (66%) as ore-based production (29%). While shifting globally in ore-based production from the average to the best available level can save 6.4 EJ yr –1, the saving potential of shifting to secondary steel-making is 8 EJ yr –1, and is limited mostly by scrap availability and steel quality requirements."

This quiet evolution was interrupted in the beginning of the 21st century, when total emissions increased by 60–68% depending on the metric applied (the fastest growth ever seen).

wg3_ch11_11.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Economic development. Regional differences in emission trends are determined by the differences observed in economic development, trade and supply chain patterns. The major source of industrial emissions is production of energy-intensive materials, such as iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, non-ferrous metals and non-metallic products. Steel and cement are key inputs to urbanisation and infrastructure development (buildings and infrastructure are responsible for about three fourths of the steel stock). Application of a ‘services-stock-flow-emissions’ perspective (Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; Bashmakov 2021; Haberl et al. 2021) shows that relationship patterns between stages of economic development, per capita stocks and flows of materials are not trivial with some clear transition points. Cao et al. (2017) mapped countries by four progressive stages in cement stock per capita S-shape evolution as a function of income and urbanisation: initial stage for developing countries with a low level and slow linear growth; take-off stage with accelerated growth; slowdown stage; and finally a shrinking stage (represented by just a few countries with very high incomes exceeding 40,000 USD2010 per capita) and urbanisation levels above 80%. Bleischwitz et al. (2018) use a similar approach with five stages to study material saturation effects for apparent consumption and stocks per capita for steel, cement, aluminium, and copper. This logic may be generalised to other materials from which in-use stock is built. While globally cement in-use stock is about 12 tonnes per capita, in developed countries it is 15–30 tonnes per capita, but the order of magnitude is lower in developing states with high per capita escalation rates (Cao et al. 2017). When stocks for some materials saturate – per capita stock peaks – the ‘scrap age’ is coming (Pauliuk et al. 2013a). Steel in-use stock has already saturated in advanced economies at 14 ± 2 tonnes per capita due to largely completed urbanisation and infrastructure developments, and a switch towards services-dominated economy. This saturation level is three to four times that of the present global average, which is below 4 tonnes per capita (Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Graedel et al. 2011; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019). China is entering the maturing stage of steel and cement consumption, resulting in a moderate projection of additional demand followed by expected industrial emissions peaking in the next 10 to 15 years (Zhou et al. 2013; Bleischwitz et al. 2018; OECD 2019a; Wu et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2020). But many developing countries are still urbanising, and the growing need for infrastructure services results in additional demand for steel and cement. Materials intensity of the global economy is projected by OECD (2019a) to decline at 1.3% yr –1 until 2060, driven by improving resource efficiency and the switch to circular economy, but with a projected tripling of global GDP it means a doubling of projected materials use (OECD 2019a). Under the business-as-usual scenario, India’s demand for steel may more than quadruple over the next 30 years (de la Rue du Can et al. 2019; Dhar et al. 2020). In the IEA (2021a) net-zero-energy scenario, the saturation effect along with material efficiency counterbalances activity effects and keeps demand growth for basic materials modest while escalate demand for critical materials (copper, lithium, nickel, graphite, cobalt and others)."

In Equation 11.1 the share of allocated emissions (Dm) equals unity when territorial emission is considered, and to the ratio of domestically used materials to total material production for consumption-based emission accounting. Tracking consumption-based emissions provides additional insights in the global effectiveness of national climate policies. Carbon emissions embodied in international trade are estimated to account for 20–30% of global carbon emissions (Meng et al. 2018; OECD.Stat 2019) and are the reason for different emissions patterns of OECD versus non-OECD countries (Chapter 2)."
wg3_ch11_11.2.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Based on OECD.Stat (2019) datasets, 2015 CO2 emissions embodied in internationally traded industrial products (manufacturing and mining, excluding fuels) by all countries are assessed at 3 GtCO2, or 30% of direct CO2 emissions in the industrial sector as reported by Crippa et al. (2021). OECD countries collectively have reduced territorial emissions (shares of basic materials in direct emissions in those regions decline (Figure 11.5 b), but demonstrated no progress in reducing outsourced emissions embedded in imported industrial products (Arto and Dietzenbacher 2014; OECD.Stat 2019). Accounting for net carbon emissions embodied in international trade of only industrial products (1283 million tCO2 in 2015) escalates direct OECD industrial CO2 emissions (1333 million tCO2 of energy-related and 502 million tCO2 of industrial processes) 1.7 fold, 2.3-fold for the US, 1.5-fold for the EU, and more than triples it for the UK, while cutting (Dm) by a third for China and Russia (OECD.Stat 2019; IEA 2020f). In most OECD economies, the amount of CO2 embodied in net import from non-OECD countries is equal to, or even greater than, the size of their Paris 2030 emissions reduction commitments. In the UK, the Parliament Committee on Energy and Climate Change requested that a consumption-based inventory be complementarily used to assess the effectiveness of domestic climate policy in delivering absolute global emissions reductions (Barrett et al. 2013; UKCCC 2019a). It should be noted that the other side of the coin is that exports from countries with lower production carbon intensities can lead to overall less emissions than if production took place in countries with high carbon intensities, which may become critical in the global evolution toward lower emissions. The evolution of Dm to the date was driven mostly by factors other than carbon regulation often equipped with carbon leakage prevention tools. Empirical tests have failed to date to detect meaningful ‘carbon leakage’ and impacts of carbon prices on net import, direct foreign investments, volumes of production, value added, employment, profits, and innovation in industry (Sartor 2013; Branger et al. 2016; Saussay and Sato 2018; Ellis et al. 2019; Naegele and Zaklan 2019; Acworth et al. 2020; Carratù et al. 2020; Pyrka et al. 2020; Zachmann and McWilliams 2020). In the coming years, availability of large low-cost renewable electricity potential and cheap hydrogen may become a new driver for relocation of such carbon intensive industries as steel production (Bataille 2020a; Gielen et al. 2020; Bataille et al. 2021a; Saygin and Gielen 2021)."

Rapid growth in material demand over the last quarter century has seen demand for key energy-intensive materials increase 2.5- to 3.5-fold (Figure 11.6), with growth linked to, and often exceeding, population growth and economic development. The International Energy Agency (IEA) explains, ‘as economies develop, urbanise, consume more goods and build up their infrastructure, material demand per capita tends to increase considerably. Once industrialised, an economy’s material demand may level off and perhaps even begin to decline’ (IEA 2019b)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The Kaya-like identity presented earlier in the chapter (Equation 11.1) suggests that material demand can be decoupled from population and economic development by two means: (i) reducing the accumulated material stock (MStock) used to deliver material services; and (ii) reducing the material (MPR+MSE) required to maintain material stocks (MStock). Such material demand reduction strategies are linked upstream to material efficiency strategies (the delivery of goods and services with less material demand, and thus energy and emissions) and to demand reduction behaviours, through concepts such as sufficiency, sustainable consumption and social practice theory (Spangenberg and Lorek 2019). Materials demand can also be influenced through urban planning, building codes and related socio-cultural norms that shape the overall demand for square metres per capita of floor space, mobility and transport infrastructures (Chapter 5)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Modelling suggests that per capita material stocks saturate (level off) in developed countries and decouple from GDP. Pauliuk et al.

More recently, Bleischwitz et al. (2018) confirmed the occurrence of a saturation effect for four materials (steel, cement, aluminium and copper) in four industrialised countries (Germany, Japan, UK and USA) together with China. These findings have led to the revision of some material demand forecasts, which previously had been based solely on population and economic trends."

Materials are required to meet demand for the creation of new stocks and the maintenance of existing stocks (Gutowski et al. 2017). Once saturation is attained the need for new stocks is minimised, and materials are only required for replacing old stocks and maintenance. Saturation allows material efficiency strategies (such as light-weight design, longer lifetimes, and more intense use) to reduce the required per capita level of material stocks, and material circularity strategies (closing material loops through remanufacture, reuse and recycling) to lessen the energy and carbon impacts required to maintain the material stock. However, it should be noted that some materials still show little evidence of saturation (i.e., plastics, see Box 11.2). Furthermore, meeting climate change targets in developed countries will require the construction of new low-carbon infrastructures (i.e., renewable energy generation, new energy distribution and storage systems, electric vehicles and building heating systems) which may increase demand for emissions intensive materials (i.e., steel, concrete and glass)."

wg3_ch11_11.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Material efficiency (ME) – the delivery of goods and services with less material – is increasingly seen as an important strategy for reducing GHG emissions in industry (IEA 2017, 2019b). Options to improve ME exist at every stage in the lifecycle of materials and products, as shown in Figure 11.7. This includes: designing products which are lighter, optimising to maintain the end-use service while minimising material use, designing for circular principles (i.e., longer life, reusability, repairability, and ease of high-quality recycling); pushing manufacturing and fabrication process to use materials and energy more efficiently and recover material wastes; increasing the capacity, intensity of use, and lifetimes of product in use; improving the recovery of materials at the end of life, through improved remanufacturing, reuse and recycling processes. For more specific examples see Allwood et al. (2012); Lovins (2018); Hertwich et al. (2019); Scott et al. (2019); and Rissman et al. (2020)."

For this reason, ME interventions have traditionally been under-represented in climate change scenario modelling and integrated assessment models (IAMs) (Grubler et al. 2018; Allwood 2018). However, two advances in the modelling of materials flows have underpinned the recent emergence of ME options being included in climate scenario modelling."
wg3_ch11_11.3.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Firstly, over many years, the academic community has built up detailed global material-flow maps of the processing steps involved in making energy-intensive materials. Some prominent recent examples include: steel (Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018b), pulp and paper (Van Ewijk et al. 2018), petrochemicals (Levi and Cullen 2018). In addition, material-flow maps at the regional and sectoral levels have flourished, for example: steel (Serrenho et al. 2016) and cement (Shanks et al. 2019) in the UK; automotive sheet-metal (Horton et al. 2019); and steel-powder applications (Azevedo et al. 2018). The detailed and transparent physical mapping of material supply chains in this manner enables ME interventions to be traced back to where emissions are released, and allows these options to be compared against decarbonisation and traditional energy efficiency measures (Levi and Cullen 2018). For example, a recent analysis by Hertwich et al. (2019) makes the link between ME strategies and reducing GHG emissions in buildings, vehicles and electronics, while Gonzalez Hernandez et al. (2018a) examines leveraging ME as a climate strategy in European Union (EU) policy. Research to explore the combined analysis of materials and energy, using exergy analysis (for steel: Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018b) allows promising comparisons across industrial sectors."
wg3_ch11_11.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Secondly, many ME interventions result in immediate GHG emissions savings (short-term), for example, light-weighting products, reusing today’s product components, and improving manufacturing yields. Yet, for other ME actions emissions savings are delayed temporally (long-term). For example, designing a product for future reuse, or with a longer life, only reaps emissions savings at the end of the product life, when emissions for a replacement product are avoided. Many durable products have long lifetimes (cars >10 years, buildings >40 years) which requires dynamic modelling of material stocks, over time, to enable these actions to be included in scenario modelling activities. Consequently, much effort has been invested recently to model material stocks in use, to estimate their lifetimes, and anticipate the future waste and replenishment materials to maintain existing stocks and grow the material stock base. Dynamic material models have been applied to material and product sectors, at the country and global level. These include, for example: vehicles stocks in the UK (Serrenho et al. 2017; Craglia and Cullen 2020) and in China (Liu et al. 2020); buildings stocks in the UK (Cabrera Serrenho et al. 2019), China (Hong et al. 2016; Cao et al. 2018, 2019) and the European Union (Sandberg et al. 2016); electronic equipment in Switzerland (Thiébaud et al. 2017); specific material stocks, such as cement (Cao et al. 2020, 2017), construction materials (Sverdrup et al. 2017; Habert et al. 2020), plastics (Geyer et al. 2017), copper (Daehn et al. 2017), and all metals (Elshkaki et al. 2018); all materials in China (Jiang et al. 2019), Switzerland (Heeren and Hellweg 2019) and the world (Krausmann et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"These two advances in the knowledge base have allowed the initial inclusion of some ME strategies in energy and climate change scenario models. The International Energy Agency (IEA) first created a ME scenario (MES) in 2015, with an estimated 17% reduction in industrial energy demand in 2040 (IEA 2015). The World Energy Outlook report includes a dedicated sub-chapter with calculations explicitly on industrial material efficiency (IEA 2019c). They also include ME options in their modelling frameworks and reporting, for example for petrochemicals (IEA 2018a), and in the Material Efficiency in Clean Energy Transitions report (IEA 2019b). In Grubler et al. (2018) 1.5°C Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario, global material output decreases by 20% from today, by 2050, with one-third due to dematerialisation, and two-thirds due to ME, resulting in significant emissions savings. Material Economics’ analysis of Industrial Transformation 2050 (Material Economics 2019), found that resource efficiency and circular economy measures (i.e., ME) could almost halve the 530 MtCO2 yr –1 emitted by the basic materials sectors in the EU by 2050. Finally, the Emissions Gap Report, UNEP (2019) includes an assessment of potential material efficiency savings in residential buildings and cars."
wg3_ch11_11.3.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Clearly, more work is required to fully integrate ME strategies into mainstream climate change models and future scenarios. Efforts are focused on endogenising ME strategies within climate change modelling, assessing the synergies and trade-offs which exist between energy efficiency and ME interventions, and building up data for the assessment of emissions saved and the cost of mitigation from real ME actions. This requires analysts to work in cross-disciplinary teams and to engage with stakeholders from across the full breadth of material supply chains. Efforts should be prioritised to foster engagement between the IAM community and emerging ME models based in the Life Cycle Assessment, Resource Efficiency, and Industrial Ecology communities (see also Sharmina et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Circular economy (CE) is another effective approach to mitigate industrial GHG emissions and has been widely promoted worldwide since the fourth IPCC assessment report (AR4). From an industrial point of view, CE focuses on closing the loop for materials and energy flows by incorporating policies and strategies for more efficient energy, materials and water consumption, while emitting minimal waste to the environment (Geng et al. 2013). Moving away from a linear mode of production (sometimes referred to as an ‘extract-produce-use-discard’ model), CE promotes the design of durable goods that can be easily repaired, with components that can be reused, remanufactured, and recycled (Wiebe et al. 2019). In particular, since CE promotes reduction, reuse and recycling, a large amount of energy and GHG-intense virgin material processing can be reduced, leading to significant carbon emission reductions. For example, in the case of aluminium, the energy efficiency of primary production is relatively close to best available technology (Figure 11.8), while switching to production using recycled materials requires only about 5% as much energy (Section 11.4.1.4). However, careful evaluation is needed from a lifecycle perspective since some recycling activities may be energy- and emission-intensive, for example, the chemical recycling of plastics (Section 11.4.1.3)."

Each level requires different tools and policies, such as CE-oriented incentive and tax policies (macro level), and eco-design regulations (micro level).

For instance, leading chemical companies are incorporating CE into their industrial practices, for example, through the design of more recyclable plastics, a differentiated and market-driven portfolio of resins, films and adhesives that deliver a total package that is more sustainable, cost-efficient and capable of meeting new packaging and plastics preferences. Problematically, at the same time the plastics industry is improving recyclability, it has, for example, been expanding into markets without recycling capacity (Mah 2021). Similarly, automakers are pursuing strategies to increase the portion of new vehicles that are fully recyclable when they reach the end of life, with increasing ambitions for using recycled material, largely motivated by end-of-life vehicle regulations. This will require networks that are available to collect and sort all the materials in vehicles, and policy incentives to do it (Wiebe et al. 2019; Soo et al. 2021)."

Industrial parks reduce the cost of infrastructure and utilities by concentrating industrial activities in planned areas, and are typically founded around large, long-term anchor companies. Complementary industries and services provided by industrial parks can entail diversified effects on the surrounding region and stimulate regional development (Huang et al. 2019a). This is crucial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) because they often lack access to information and funds for sophisticated technologies."
wg3_ch11_11.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Typical CE tools and policies at this level include sustainable supply chains and industrial symbiosis. A common platform for sharing information and enhancing communication among industrial stakeholders through the application of information and telecommunication technologies is helpful for facilitating the creation of industrial symbiosis. The main benefit of industrial symbiosis is the overall reduction of both virgin materials and final wastes, as well as reduced/avoided transportation costs from by-product exchanges among tenant companies, which can specifically help small- and medium-sized enterprises to improve their growth and competitiveness. From a climate perspective, this indicates significant industrial emission mitigation since the extraction, processing of virgin materials and the final disposal of industrial wastes are more energy intensive. Also, careful site selection of such parks can facilitate the use of renewable energy. Due to these advantages, eco-industrial parks have been actively promoted, especially in East Asian countries, such as China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), where national indicators and governance exist (Geng et al. 2019). For instance, the successful implementation of industrial symbiosis at Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone has achieved significant co-benefits, including GHG-emission reduction, economic and social benefits, and improved ecosystem functions (Liu et al. 2018). Another case at Ulsan industrial park, South Korea, estimated that 60,522 tonnes of CO2 were avoided annually through industrial symbiosis between two companies (Kim et al. 2018b). The case of China shows the great potential of implementing these measures, estimating 111 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent will be reduced in 213 national-level industrial parks in 2030 compared with 2015 (Guo et al. 2018). As such, South Korea’s national eco-industrial park project has reduced over 4.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent through their industrial symbiosis efforts (Park et al. 2019). Meso-level CE solutions have been identified as essential for industrial decarbonisation (Section 11.4.3). Moreover, waste prevention as the top of the so-called ‘waste hierarchy’ can be promoted on the meso level for specific materials or product systems. For instance, the European Environment Agency published a report on plastic waste prevention approaches in all 28 EU-member states (Wilts and Bakas 2019). However, challenges exist for industrial symbiosis activities, such as inter-firm contractual uncertainties, the lack of synergy infrastructure, and the regulations that hamper reuse and recycling. Therefore, necessary legal reforms are needed to address these implementation barriers."
wg3_ch11_11.3.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Macro level: The macro level uses both micro- and meso-level tools within a broader policy strategy, addressing the specific challenge of CE as a cross-cutting policy (Wilts et al. 2016). More synergy opportunities exist beyond the boundary of one industrial park. This indicates the necessity of scaling up industrial symbiosis to urban symbiosis. Urban symbiosis is defined as the use of by-products (waste) from cities as alternative raw materials for energy sources for industrial operations (Sun et al. 2017). It is based on synergistic opportunity arising from geographic proximity through the transfer of physical sources (waste materials) for environmental and economic benefits. Japan is the first country to promote urban symbiosis. For instance, the Kawasaki urban symbiosis efforts can save over 114,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually (Ohnishi et al. 2017). Another simulation study indicates that Shanghai (the largest Chinese city) has the potential to save up to 16.8 MtCO2 through recycling all the available wastes (Dong et al. 2018). As such, the simulation of urban-energy-symbiosis networks in Ulsan, South Korea, indicates that 243,396 tCO2–1 yr –1 emission and USD48 million yr –1 fuel cost can be saved (Kim et al. 2018a). Moreover, Wiebe et al. (2019) estimate that the adoption of the CE can lead to a significantly lower global material extraction compared to a baseline. Their global results range from a decrease of about 27% in metal extraction to 8% in fossil fuel extraction and use, 8% in forestry products, and about 7% in non-metallic minerals, indicating significant climate change benefits. A macro-perspective calculation on the circulation of iron in Japan’s future society shows that CO2 emissions from the steel sector can be reduced by 56% as per the following assumptions: the amount recovered from social stock is the same as the amount of inflow, and all scrap was used domestically, and the export of steel products is halved (LCS 2018). A key challenge is to go beyond ensuring proper waste management to setting metrics, targets and incentives to preserve the incorporated value in specific waste streams. Estimations for Germany have shown that despite recycling rates of 64% for all solid-waste streams, these activities only lead to a resource-use reduction of only 18% (Steger et al. 2019). In general, the identification of the most appropriate CE method for different countries requires understanding and information exchange on background conditions, local policies and myriad other factors influencing material flows from the local up to the global level (Tapia Carlos et al. 2019). Also, an information platform should be created at the national level so that all the stakeholders can share their CE technologies and expertise, information (such as materials/energy/water consumption data), and identify the potential synergy opportunities."
wg3_ch11_11.3.4_p1,Heat-use Energy Efficiency Improvement ,"Energy efficiency in industry is an important mitigation option and central in keeping 1.5°C within reach (IPCC SR1.5). It has long been recognised as the first mitigation option in industry (Yeen Chan and Kantamaneni 2016; Nadel and Ungar 2019; IEA 2021a). It allows reduction of the necessary scale of deployment for low-carbon energy supplies and associated mitigation costs (Energy Transitions Commission 2018). The efficiency potentials are greatest in the non-energy-intensive industries and are often relatively limited in energy-intensive ones, such as steel (Pardo and Moya 2013; Kuramochi 2016; Arens et al. 2017).

There are two parallel processes in improvement of specific energy consumption (SEC): progress in energy-efficient BAT and moving the SEC of industrial plants towards BAT. Both slow down as theoretical thermodynamic minimums are approached (Gutowski et al. 2013). For the last several decades the focus has been on effective spreading of BAT technologies through application of policies for worldwide diffusion of energy-saving technologies (Section 11.6). As a result the SEC for many basic primary materials is approaching BAT and there are signs that energy efficiency improvements have been slowing down over recent decades (IEA 2019d, 2020a, 2021a) (Figure 11.8)."

In general, and non-exclusively, this implies a transition from coal (about 0.09 tCO2GJ–1 on combustion), refined petroleum products (about 0.07 tCO2GJ–1), and natural gas (about 0.05 tCO2GJ–1) to biofuels, direct solar heating, electricity, hydrogen, ammonia, or net zero synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Switching to these energy carriers is not necessarily lower emitting, however; how they are made matters."
wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Fuel switching has already been observed to reduce direct combustion CO2 emissions in many jurisdictions. There are significant debates about the net effect of upstream fossil fuel production and fugitive emissions, but observers have noted that in the case of US power generation it would take a leakage rate of about 2.7% from natural gas production to undo the direct fuel switching from coal mitigation effect, and the value is likely higher in most cases (Alvarez et al. 2012; Hausfather 2015). Coal mine methane emissions are also estimated to be substantially higher than previously assessed (Kholod et al. 2020). Alvarez et al. (2018) estimated US fugitive emissions (not including the Permian) at 2.3% of supply, 60% more than previously estimated, while recent Canadian papers indicate fugitive emissions are at least 50% more than reported (Chan et al. 2020; MacKay et al. 2021). However, given the potential for energy supply infrastructure lock-in effects (Tong et al. 2019), purely fossil fuel to fossil fuel switching is a limited and potentially dangerous strategy unless it is used very carefully and in a limited way."
wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Biofuels come in many forms, including ones that are nearly identical to fossil fuels but sourced from biogenic sources. Solid biomass, either direct from wood chips, lignin or processed pellets, is the most commonly used renewable fuel in industry today and is occasionally used in cement kilns and boilers. Biomethane, biomethanol, and bioethanol are all commercially made today using fermentation and anaerobic digestion techniques and are mostly ‘drop-in’ compatible with fossil fuel equivalents. In principle they cycle carbon in and out of the atmosphere, but their lifecycle GHG intensities are typically not GHG neutral due to land-use changes, soil carbon depletion, fertiliser use, and other dynamics (Hepburn et al. 2019), and are highly case specific. Most commercial biofuel feedstocks come from agricultural (e.g., corn) and food waste sources, and the feedstock is limited; to meet higher levels of biomass use a transition to using higher cellulose feedstocks like straw, switchgrass and wood waste, available in much larger quantities, must be fully commercialised and deployed. Significant efforts have been made to make ethanol from cellulosic biomass, which promises much higher quantities, lower costs, and lower intensities, but commercialisation efforts, with a few exceptions, have largely not succeeded (Padella et al. 2019). The IEA estimates, however, that up to 20% of today’s fossil methane use, including by industry, could be met with biomethane (IEA 2020g) by 2040, using a mixture of feedstocks and production techniques. Biofuel use may also be critical for producing negative emissions when combined with carbon capture and storage (i.e., bioenergy with carbon capture and storage – BECCS). Most production routes for biofuels, biochemicals and biogas generate large side streams of concentrated CO2 which is easily captured, and which could become a source of negative emissions (Sanchez et al. 2018) (Section11.3.6). Finally, it should be noted that biofuel combustion can, if inadequately controlled, have substantial negative local air quality effects, with implications for SDGs 3, 7 and 11."

Electricity is a flexible energy carrier that can be made from many forms of primary energy, with high potential process improvements in terms of end-use efficiency (Eyre 2021), quality and process controllability, digitisability, and no direct local air pollutants (McMillan et al. 2016; Jadun et al. 2017; Deason et al. 2018; Mai et al. 2018). The net-GHG effect of electrification is contingent on how the electricity is made, and because total output increases can be expected, for full effect it should be made with a very low GHG intensity primary source (i.e., <50 g CO2 kWh –1: e.g., hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, wind, solar photovoltaics, or fossil fuels with 95+% carbon capture and storage (IPCC 2014)). This has strong implications for the electricity sector and its generation mix when the goal is a net-zero-emissions electricity system. Despite their falling costs, progressively higher mixes of variable wind and solar on a given grid will require support from grid flexibility sources, including demand response, more transmission, storage on multiple time scales, or firm low-to-negative emissions generation sources (e.g., nuclear energy, hydrogen fuel cells or turbines, biofuels, fossil or biofuels with CCS, and geothermal) to moderate costs (Jenkins et al. 2018; Sepulveda et al. 2018; Williams et al. 2021). Regions that may be slower to reduce the GHG intensity of their electricity production will likely need to consider more aggressive use of other measures, like energy and material efficiency or bioenergy."

wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"For these reasons, lighter, manufacturing-orientated industries are more readily electrifiable than heavier industry like steel, cement, chemicals and other sectors with high heat and feedstock needs. Steam boilers, curing, drying and small-scale process heating, with typically lower maximum heat temperature needs (<200°C–250°C) are readily electrifiable with appropriate fossil-fuel-to-electricity price ratios (accounting for capital costs and efficiencies), and direct induction and infrared heating are available for higher temperature needs. These practices are uncommon outside regions with ample hydroelectric power due to the currently relatively low cost of coal, natural gas and heating oil, and especially when there is no carbon combustion cost. Madeddu et al. (2020) argue up to 78% of Europe’s industrial energy requirements are electrifiable through existing commercial technologies. In contrast, Mai et al. (2018) saw only a moderate industrial heat supply electrification in their high-electrification scenario for the US. Electrification has also been explored in: raw and recycled steel (Fischedick et al. 2014 b; Vogl et al. 2018); ammonia (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Philibert 2017a); and chemicals (Palm et al. 2016; Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017). While most chemical production of feedstock chemicals (e.g., H2, NH3, CO, CH3OH, C2H4, C2H6 and C2H5OH) is done thermo-catalytically today, it is feasible to use direct electrocatalytic production, by itself or in combination with utilisation of previously captured carbon sources if a fossil fuel feedstock is used, or well-known bio-catalytic (e.g., fermentation) and thermo-catalytic processes (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; De Luna et al. 2019; Kätelhön et al. 2019).

For example, 75 TWh of electricity was used by steel in the EU in 2015 (out of the 1000 TWh total used by industry), Material Economics (2019), varying between their new process, circularity and CCUS scenarios, projects increased demand to 355 (+373%), 214 (+185%) and 238 (+217%) TWh. These values are consistent with Vogl et al. (2018), which projects a tripling of electricity demand in the German or Swedish steel industries if hydrogen-direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace steel-making (DRI EAFs) replaces BF-BOFs. Material Economics (2019) was conservative with its use of electricity in chemical production, making preferential use of biofeedstocks and some CCUS, and electricity demand still rose from 118 TWh to 510, 395 and 413 TWh in their three scenarios. Bazzanella and Ausfelder (2017), exploring deeper reductions from the chemical sector using more electrochemistry, projected scenarios with higher electricity demands of 960–4900 TWh (140% of the projected available clean electricity at the time) with maximum electricity use. In counterpoint, however, with revised wind capabilities and costs, the IEA (2019e) Offshore Wind Outlook indicates that ten times the current EU electricity use could be produced if necessary. Greater use of electro-catalytic versus thermo-catalytic chemistry, as projected by De Luna et al. (2019), could greatly reduce these electricity needs, but the technology readiness levels are currently low. Finally, the UKCCC (2019b), which focused primarily on CCS for industry in its ‘Further Ambition’ scenario (the UK currently consumes about 300 TWh), in its supplementary ‘Further Electrification’ scenario projects an additional 300 TWh for general electrolysis needs and another 200 TWh for synthetic fuel production."

This indicates a possible need for another energy carrier to minimise instantaneous generation and transmission needs. These needs can be met at varying current and potential future costs using: bioliquids or gases hydrogen, ammonia, or net zero synthetic hydrocarbons or alcohols."
wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p10,NO_TITLE,"Broadly speaking, hydrogen can contribute to a cleaner energy system in two ways: (i) existing applications of hydrogen (e.g., nitrogen fertiliser production, refinery upgrading) can use hydrogen produced using alternative, cleaner production methods; (ii) new applications can use low-GHG hydrogen as an alternative to current fuels and inputs, or as a complement to the greater use of electricity in these applications. In these cases – for example, in transport, heating, industry (e.g., hydrogen-direct reduced iron and steel production) and electricity – hydrogen can be used in its pure form, or be converted to hydrogen-based fuels, including ammonia, or synthetic net zero hydrocarbons and alcohols such as methane or methanol (IEA 2019f). The IEA states that hydrogen could be used to help integrate more renewables, including by enhancing storage options and ‘exporting sunshine and wind’ from places with abundant resources; decarbonise steel, chemicals, trucks, ships and planes; and boost energy security by diversifying the fuel mix and providing flexibility to balance grids (IEA 2019f)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p11,NO_TITLE,"Around 70 Mt yr –1 of pure hydrogen is produced today: 76% from natural gas and 23% from coal, resulting in emissions of roughly 830 MtCO2 yr –1 in 2016/17 (IEA 2019f), or 4.7% of global industrial direct and indirect emissions (waste excluded;Table 11.1). Fuels refining (about 410 MtCO2 yr –1) and production of ammonia (420 MtCO2 yr –1) largely dominate its uses. Another 45 Mt hydrogen is being produced along with other gases, on purpose or as by-products, and used as fuel, to make methanol or as a chemical reactant (IEA 2019f). Very low and potentially zero GHG (depending on the energy source) hydrogen can be made via: electrolysis separation of water into hydrogen and oxygen (Glenk and Reichelstein 2019), also known as ‘green H2’; electrothermal separation of water, as done in some nuclear plants (Bicer and Dincer 2017); partial oxidation of coal or naphtha or steam/auto methane reforming (SMR/ATR) combined with CCS (Leeson et al. 2017), or ‘blue H2’; methane pyrolysis, where the hydrogen and carbon are separated thermally and the carbon is left as a solid (Abbas and Wan Daud 2010; Ashik et al. 2015), or via biomass gasification (Ericsson 2017), which could be negative emissions if the CO2 from the gasification process is sequestered. All these processes would in turn need to be run using very low or zero GHG energy carriers for the resulting hydrogen to also be low in GHG emissions."
wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p12,NO_TITLE,"Ammonia production, made from hydrogen and nitrogen using the Haber-Bosch process, is the most voluminous chemical produced from fossil fuels, being used as feedstock for nitrogen fertilisers and explosives, as well as a cleanser, a refrigerant, and for other uses. Most ammonia is made today using methane as the hydrogen feedstock and heat source but has been made using electrolysis-based hydrogen in the past, and there are several announced investments to resume doing so. If ammonia is used as a combustion fuel, care must be taken to avoid N2O as a GHG and NOx in general as a local air pollutant."
wg3_ch11_11.3.5_p13,NO_TITLE,"Hydrogen can also be combined with low-to-zero net GHG carbon (Section11.3.6) and oxygen and made into methane, methanol and other potential net zero synthetic hydrocarbonsand alcohol energy carriers using methanation, steam reforming and Fischer-Tropsch processes, all of which can provide higher degrees of storable and shippable high-temperature energy using known industrial processes in novel combinations (Bataille et al. 2018a; Davis et al. 2018). If the hydrogen and oxygen is accessed via electrolysis, the terms ‘power-to-fuel’ or ‘e-fuels’ are often used (Ueckerdt et al. 2021). Given their carbon content, if used as fuels, their carbon will eventually be oxidised and emitted as CO2 to the atmosphere. This makes their net-GHG intensity dependent on the carbon source (Hepburn et al. 2019), with recycled fossil fuels, biocarbon and direct air capture carbon all having very different net-CO2 impacts – see section 11.3.6 on CCS and CCU for elaboration."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Carbon is an important and highly flexible building block for a wide range of fuels, organic chemicals and materials including methanol, ethanol, olefins, plastics, textiles, and wood and paper products. In this chapter we define CCS as requiring return of CO2 from combustion or process gases or ambient air to the geosphere for geological time periods (i.e., thousands of years) (IPCC 2005; IEA 2009; Bruhn et al. 2016; IEA 2019g). CCU is defined as being where carbon (as CO or CO2) is captured from one process and reused for another, reducing emissions from the initial process, but is then potentially but not necessarily released to the atmosphere in following processes (Bruhn et al. 2016; Detz and van der Zwaan 2019; Tanzer and Ramírez 2019). In both cases the net effect on atmospheric emissions depends on the initial source of the carbon, be it from a fossil fuel, from biomass, or from direct air capture (Cuéllar-Franca and Azapagic 2015; Hepburn et al. 2019) and the duration of storage or use, which can vary from days to millennia."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"While CCS and CCU share common capture technologies, what happens to the CO2 and therefore the strategies that will employ them can be very different. CCS can help maintain near-CO2 neutrality for fossil CO2 that passes through the process, with highly varying partially negative emissions if the source is biogenic (Hepburn et al. 2019), and fully negative emissions if the source is air capture, all not considering the energy used to drive the above processes. CCS has been covered in other IPCC publications at length, for example, IPCC (2005), and in most mitigation-oriented assessments since, for example, the IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2020 and Net Zero scenario reports (IEA 2021a, 2020a). The potentials and costs for CCS in industry vary considerably due to the diversity of industrial processes (Leeson et al. 2017), as well as the volume and purity of different flows of CO2 (Naims 2016); Kearns et al. (2021) provide a recent review. As a general rule it is not possible to capture all the CO2 emissions from an industrial plant. To achieve zero or negative emissions, CCS would need to be combined with some use of sustainably sourced biofuel or feedstock, or the remaining emissions would need to be offset by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) elsewhere."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"For concentrated CO2 sources (e.g., cleaning of wellhead formation gas to make it suitable for the pipeline network, hydrogen production using steam methane reforming, ethanol fermentation, or from combustion of fossil fuels with oxygen in a nitrogen-free environment, i.e., ‘oxycombustion’) CCS is already amenable to commercial oil and gas reinjection techniques used to eliminate hydrogen sulphide gas and brines at prices of USD10–40 tCO2-eq –1 sequestered (Wilson et al. 2003; Leeson et al. 2017). Most currently operating CCS facilities take advantage of concentrated CO2 flows, for example, from formation gas cleaning on the Snoevit and Sleipner platforms in Norway, from syngas production for the Al Reyadah DRI steel plant in Abu Dhabi, and from SMR hydrogen production on the Quest upgrader in Alberta. Since concentrated process CO2 emissions are often exempted from existing cap and trade systems, these opportunities for CCS have largely gone unexploited. Many existing projects partially owe their existence to the utilisation of the captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery, which in many cases counts as both CCS and CCU because of the permanent nature of the CO2 disposal upon injection if sealed properly (Mac Dowell et al. 2017). There are several industrial CCS strategies and pilot projects working to take advantage of the relative ease of concentrated CO2 disposal (e.g., LEILAC for limestone calcination process emissions from cement production, HISARNA direct oxycombustion smelting for steel) (Bataille 2020a). An emerging option for storing carbon is methane pyrolysis by which methane is split into hydrogen and solid carbon that may subsequently be stored (Schneider et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"There are several post-combustion CCS projects underway globally (IEA 2019g), generally focused on energy production and processing rather than industry. Their costs are higher but evolving downward – Giannaris et al. (2020) suggest USD47 tCO2–1 for a follow-up 90% capture power generation plant based on learnings from the Saskpower Boundary Dam pilot – but crucially these costs are higher than implicit and explicit carbon prices almost everywhere, resulting in limited investment and learning in these technologies. A key challenge with all CCS strategies, however, is building a gathering and transport network for CO2, especially from dispersed existing sites; hence most pilot projects are  built near EOR/geological storage sites, and the movement towards industrial clustering in the EU and UK (UKCCC 2019b), and as suggested in IEA (2019f)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"In the case of CCU, CO and CO2 are captured and subsequently converted into valuable products (e.g., building materials, chemicals and synthetic fuels) (Styring et al. 2011; Bruhn et al. 2016; Artz et al. 2018; Brynolf et al. 2018; Daggash et al. 2018; Breyer et al. 2019; Kätelhön et al. 2019; Vreys et al. 2019). CCU has been envisioned as part of the ‘circular economy’ but conflicting expectations on CCU and its association or not with CCS leads to different and contested framings (Palm and Nikoleris 2021). The duration of the CO2 storage in these products varies from days to millennia according to the application, potentially but not necessarily replacing new fossil, biomass or direct air capture feedstocks, before meeting one of several possible fates: permanent burial, decomposition, recycling or combustion, all with differing GHG implications. While the environmental assessment of CCS projects is relatively straightforward, however, this is not the case for CCU technologies. The net-GHG mitigation impact of CCU depends on several factors (e.g., the capture rate, the energy requirements, the lifetime of utilisation products, the production route that is substituted, and associated room for improvement along the traditional route) and has to be determined by lifecycle CO2 or GHG analysis (e.g., Nocito and Dibenedetto 2020; and Bruhn et al. 2016). For example, steel-mill gases containing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can be used as feedstock together with hydrogen for producing chemicals. In this way, the carbon originally contained in the coke used in the blast furnace is used again, or cascaded, and emissions are reduced but not brought to zero. If fossil-sourced CO2 is only reused once and then emitted, the maximum reduction is 50% (Tanzer and Ramírez 2019). The logic of using steel-mill CO and CO2 could equally be applied to gasified biomass, however, with a far lower net-GHG footprint, likely negative, which CCU fed by fossil fuels cannot be if end-use combustion is involved."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"Partly because of the complexity of the lifecycle analysis accounting, the literature on CCU is not always consistent in terms of the net-GHG impacts of strategies. For example, Artz et al. (2018), focused not just on GHG mitigation but multi-attribute improvements to chemical processes from reutilisation of CO2, suggests the largest reduction in the absolute amount of GHGs from CO2 reutilisation could be achieved by the coupling of highly concentrated CO2 sources with carbon-free hydrogen or electrons from low GHG power in so called ‘power-to-fuel’ scenarios. From the point of view of maximising GHG mitigation using surplus ‘curtailed’ renewable power, however, Daggash et al. (2018) instead indicates the best use would be for direct air capture and CCS. These results depend on what system is being measured, and what the objective is."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p7,NO_TITLE,"There are several potential crucial transitional roles for synthetic hydrocarbons and alcohols (e.g., methane, methanol, ethanol, ethylene, diesel and jet fuel) constructed using fossil, biomass or direct carbon capture (DAC) and CCU (Breyer et al. 2015; Dimitriou et al. 2015; Sternberg and Bardow 2015; Fasihi et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Bataille 2020a). They can allow reductions in the GHG intensity of high-value legacy transport, industry and real estate that currently runs on fossil fuels but cannot be easily or readily retrofitted. They can be used by existing long-lived energy and feedstock infrastructure, transport and storage, which can compensate for seasonal supply fluctuations and contribute to enhancing energy security (Ampelli et al. 2015). Finally, they can reduce the GHG intensity of end uses that are very difficult to run on electricity, hydrogen or ammonia (e.g., long-haul aviation). However, their equivalent mitigation cost today would be very high (USD960–1440 tCO2-eq –1), with the potential to fall to USD24–324 tCO2-eq –1) with commercial economies of scale, with very high uncertainty (Hepburn et al. 2019; IEA 2020a; Ueckerdt et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p8,NO_TITLE,"A very large and important uncertainty is the long-term demand for hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels (whether fossil-, biomass- or DAC-based), chemical feedstocks (e.g., methanol and ethylene) and materials, and competition for biomass feedstock with other priorities, including agriculture, biodiversity and other proximate land-use needs, as well as need for negative emissions through BECCS. The current global plastics production of around 350 Mt yr –1 is almost entirely based on petroleum feedstock and recycling rates are very low. If this or future demand were to be 100% biomass-based it would require tens of exajoules of biomass feedstock (Meys et al. 2021). If demand can be lowered and recycling increased (mechanical as well as chemical) the demand for biomass feedstock can be much lower (Material Economics 2019). Promising routes in the short-term would be to utilise CO2 from anaerobic digestion for biogas and fermentation for ethanol in the production of methane or methanol (Ericsson 2017); methanol can be converted into ethylene and propylene in a methanol-to-olefins process and used in the production of plastics (Box 11.2). New process configurations where hydrogen is integrated into biomass conversion routes to increase yields and utilise all carbon in the feedstock are relatively unexplored (Ericsson 2017; De Luna et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p9,NO_TITLE,"There are widely varying estimates of the capacity of CCU to reduce GHG emissions and meet the net zero objective. According to Hepburn et al. (2019), the estimated potential for the scale of CO2 utilisation in fuels varies widely, from 1 to 4.2 GtCO2 yr –1, reflecting uncertainties in potential market penetration, requiring carbon prices of around USD40 to 80 tCO2–1, increasing over time. The high end represents a future in which synthetic fuels have sizeable market shares, due to cost reductions and policy drivers. The low end – which is itself considerable – represents very modest penetration into the methane and fuels markets, but it could also be an overestimate if CO2-derived products do not become cost competitive with alternative clean energy vectors such as hydrogen or ammonia, or with direct sequestration. Brynolf et al. (2018) indicates that a key cost variable will be the cost of electrolysers for producing hydrogen. Kätelhön et al. (2019) estimate that up to 3.5 GtC yr –1 could be displaced from chemical production by 2030 using CCU, but this would require clean electricity equivalent to 55% of estimated global power production, at the same time other sectors’ demand would also be rising. Mac Dowell et al. (2017) suggest that while CCU, and specifically CO2-based enhanced oil recovery, may be an important economic incentive for early CCS projects (up to 4–8% of required mitigation by 2050), it is unlikely the chemical conversion of CO2 for CCU will account for more than 1% of overall mitigation."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p10,NO_TITLE,"Finally, there is another class of CCU activities associated with carbonation of alkaline industrial wastes (including iron and steel slags, coal fly ash, mining and mineral processing wastes, incinerator residues, cement and concrete wastes, and pulp and paper mill wastes) using waste or atmospheric CO2. Given the large volume of alkaline wastes produced by industry, capture estimates are as high as 4 GtCO2 yr −1 (Cuéllar-Franca and Azapagic 2015; Ebrahimi et al. 2017; Kaliyavaradhan and Ling 2017; Pasquier et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2019c; Pan et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020) However, as some alkaline wastes are already used directly as supplementary cementitious materials to reduce clinker-to-cement ratios, and their abundant availability in the future is questionable (e.g., steel blast furnace slag and coal fly ash), there will be a strong competition between mitigation uses (Section 11.4.2), and the potential for direct removal by carbonation is estimated at about 1 GtCO2 yr −1 (Renforth 2019)."
wg3_ch11_11.3.6_p11,NO_TITLE,"The above CCU literature has identified that there may be a highly unpredictable competition between fossil, biogenic and direct air capture carbon to provide highly uncertain chemical feedstock, material and fuel needs. Fossil waste carbon will likely initially be plentiful but will add to net atmospheric CO2 when released. Biogenic carbon is variably, partially net-negative, but the available stock will be finite and compete with biodiversity and agriculture needs for land. Direct air capture carbon will require significant amounts of low-GHG electricity or methane with high-capture rate CCS (Keith et al. 2018). There are clearly strong interactive effects between low-carbon electrification, switching to biomass, hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic hydrocarbons via CCU, and CCS."
wg3_ch11_11.3.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"In this section we conceptually address interactions between service demand, service product intensity, product material efficiency, energy efficiency, electrication and fuel switching, CCU and CCS, and what conflicts and synergies may exist. Post AR5 a substantial literature has emerged, see Rissman et al. (2020), that addresses integrated and interactive technical deep decarbonisation pathways for GHG-intense industrial sectors, and how they interact with the rest of the economy (Denis-Ryan et al. 2016; Åhman et al. 2017; Wesseling et al. 2017; Axelson et al. 2018; Davis et al. 2018; Bataille et al. 2018a; Bataille 2020a). It is a common finding across this literature and a related scenario literature (Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Material Economics 2019; UKCCC 2019a,b; IEA 2019b, 2020a; CAT 2020; IEA 2021a) that deep decarbonisation of industry requires integrating all available options. There is no ‘silver bullet’ and so all behavioural and technological options have to be mobilised, with more emphasis required on the policy mechanisms necessary to engage a challenging transition in the coming decades in highly competitive, currently GHG-intense, price-sensitive sectors with long-lived capital stock (Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Bataille 2020a), discussed in the final section of this chapter."
wg3_ch11_11.3.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"While the strategies are not sequential and interact strongly, we discuss them in the order given. Reduced demand through reduced service demand and product intensity per service unit (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) reduces the need for the next six strategies. Greater material efficiency (see earlier sections) reduces the need for the next five, and so on – see Figure 11.9 above."

The entire chain’s potential will be maximised when these strategies are designed in ahead of time instead of considered on assembly, or as a retrofit (Allwood et al. 2012; Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018a; IEA 2019b; Material Economics 2019; Bataille 2020a). For example, when designing a building: (i) Is the building shell, interior mass and ducting orientated for passive heating and cooling, and can the shell and roof have building-integrated solar PV or added easily, with hard-to-retrofit wiring already incorporated? (ii) Are steel and high-quality concrete only used where really needed (i.e., for shear, tension and compression strength), can sections be prefabricated off-site, can other materials be substituted, such as wood? (iii) Can the interior fittings be built with easy-to-recycle plastics or other sustainably disposable materials (e.g., wood)? (iv) Can this building potentially serve multiple purposes through its anticipated lifetime, are service conduits oversized and easy to access for retrofitting? (v) When it is time to be taken apart, can pieces be reused, and all componnents recycled at high purity levels, for example, can all the copper wiring be easily be found and removed, are the steel beams clearly tagged with their content? The answers to these questions will be very regionally and site specific, and require revision of educational curricula for the entire supply chain, as well as revision of building codes."
wg3_ch11_11.3.7_p5,NO_TITLE,"Energy efficiency is a critical strategy for net zero transitions and enabling clean electrification (IEA 2021a). Improving the efficiency of energy services provision reduces the need for material intensive energy supply, energy storage, CCU and CCS infrastructure, and limits generation and transmission expansion to reduce an ever-higherdemand, with associated generation, transmission, and distribution losses. Using electricity efficiently can help reduces peak demand and the need for peaking plants (currently often powered by fossil fuels), and energy storage systems."
wg3_ch11_11.3.7_p6,NO_TITLE,"Electrification and final energy efficiency are deeply entangled, because switching to electricity from fossil fuels in most cases improves GJ for GJ end-use energy efficiency: resistance heaters are almost 100% efficient, heat pumps can be 300–400% efficient, induction melting can improve mixing and temperature control, and electric vehicle motors typically translate 90–95% of input electricity to motor drive in contrast to 35–45% for a large, modern internal combustion engine. Overall, the combined effect could be 40% lower global final energy demand assuming renewable electricity is used (Eyre 2021)."

Whether or not they compete for a wide range of end uses and primary demand needs will be regional and whether or not infrastructure is available to supply them. Regions with less than optimal renewable energy resources, or not sufficient to meet growing needs, could potentially indirectly import them as liquid or compressed hydrogen, ammonia or synthetic hydrocarbon feedstocks made in regions with abundant resources (Armijo and Philibert 2020; Bataille 2020a). Large-scale CCU and CCS applications need additional basic materials to build corresponding infrastructure and energy to operate it, thus reducing overall material and energy efficiencies."

wg3_ch11_11.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"An integrated sequencing of mature short-term actions and less mature longer-term actions is crucial to avoid lock-in effects. Temporal implementation and discussion of the general quantitative role of the different options to achieve net zero emissions in the industrial sectors is core to the second part of the section (Section 11.4.2), where industry-wide mitigation pathways are analysed. This comprises the collection and discussion of mitigation scenarios available in the literature with a high technological resolution for the industry sector in addition to a set of illustrative global and national GHG mitigation scenarios selected from chapters 3 and 4, representing different GHG mitigation ambitions and different pathways to achieve certain mitigation targets. Comparing technology-focused sector-based scenarios with more top-down-oriented scenario approaches allows for a reciprocal assessment of both perspectives and helps to identify robust elements for the transformation of the sector. Comparison of real-world conditions within the sector (e.g., industry structure and logics, investment cycles, market behaviour, power, and institutional capacity) and the transformative pathways described in the scenarios helps researchers, analysts, governments, and all stakeholders understand the need not only for technological change, but for structural (e.g., new value chains, markets, infrastructures, and sectoral couplings) and behavioural (e.g., design practices and business models) change at multiple levels."

Relevant interactions are identified and discussed in the third and fourth part of the subsection. Changes are induced along the whole value chain, i.e., switching to an alternative (climate-friendly, e.g., low-GHG hydrogen-based) steel-making process has substantial impacts on the value chain, associated sub-suppliers, and electricity and coal outputs. In addition, cross-sectoral interactions are discussed. This includes feedback loops with other end-use chapters, for example, higher material demand through market penetration of some GHG mitigation technologies or measures (e.g., insulation materials for buildings, steel for windmills) and lower demand through others (e.g., less steel for fossil fuel extraction, transport and processing), or substantial additional demand of critical materials (e.g., the widely varying demands for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earths for producing windmills, solar panels, and batteries). Generally, if consumption- (or behaviour-) driven additional material demand creates scarcity it becomes important to increase efforts on material efficiency, substitution, recycling/reuse, and sustainable consumption patterns."

wg3_ch11_11.4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"For the period leading up to 2020, in terms of end-use allocation globally, approximately 40% of steel is used for structures, 20% for industrial equipment, 18% for consumer products, 13% for infrastructure, and 10% for vehicles (Bataille 2020b). The global production of crude steel increased by 41% between 2008 and 2020 (World Steel Association 2021) and its GHG emissions, depending on the scope covered, is 3.7–4.1 GtCO2-eq. It represented 20% of total global direct industrial emissions in 2019 accounting for coke oven and blast furnace gases use (Crippa et al. 2021; Lamb et al. 2021; Minx et al. 2021; Olivier and Peters 2018; World Steel Association 2021; IEA 2020a) (Figure 11.4 and Table 11.1). Steel production can be divided into primary production based on iron ore and secondary production based on steel scrap. The blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace route (BF-BOF) is the main primary steel route globally, while the electric arc furnace (EAF) is the preferred process for the less energy and emissions-intensive melting and alloying of recycled steel scrap. The direct reduced iron (DRI) route is a lesser-used route that replaces BFs for reducing iron ore, usually followed by an EAF. In 2019, 73% of global crude steel production was produced in BF-BOFs, while 26% was produced in EAFs, a nominal 5.6% of which is DRI (World Steel Association 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,An estimated 15% energy efficiency improvement is possible within the BF-BOF process (Figure 11.8). Several options exist for deep-GHG emissions reductions in steel-production processes (Fischedick et al. 2014 b; Leeson et al. 2017; Axelson et al. 2018; Vogl et al. 2018; Bataille 2020a; Holappa 2020; Rissman et al. 2020; Fan and Friedmann 2021; Wang et al. 2021).Each could reduce specific CO2 emissions of primary steel production by 80% or more relative to today’s dominant BF-BOF route if input streams are based on carbon-free energy and feedstock sources or if they deploy high-capture CCS:
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"•Increasing the share of the secondary route can bring down emissions quickly and potential emissions savings are significant, from a global average 2.3 tCO2–1 per tonne steel in BF-BOFs down to 0.3 (or less) tCO2–1 per tonne steel in EAFs (Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Zhou et al. 2019), the latter depending on scrap preheating and electricity GHG intensity. However, realising this potential is dependent on the availability of regional and global scrap supplies and requires careful sorting and scrap management, especially to eliminate copper contamination (Daehn et al. 2017). There is significant uncertainty about how much new scrap will be available and usable (Xylia et al. 2018; IEA 2019b; Wang et al. 2021). Most steel is recycled already; the gains are mainly to be made in quality (i.e., separation from contaminants like copper). End-of-life scrap availability and its contribution to steel production will increase as in use stock saturates in many countries (Xylia et al. 2016)."

(2016) and Fan and Friedmann (2021) indicate that it would be difficult to retrofit BF-BOFs beyond 50% capture, which is insufficient for long-term emission targets but may be useful in some cases for avoiding cumulative emissions where other options are not available. However, BF-BOFs need their furnaces relined every 15–25 years (IEA 2021a; Vogl et al. 2021b), at a cost of 80–100% of a new build, and this would be an opportunity to build a new facility designed for 90%+ capture (e.g., fewer CO2 outlets). This would depend upon access to transport to geology appropriate for CCS."

During a transitional period, DRI could start with methane or a mixture of methane and hydrogen as some of the methane (≤30% hydrogen can be substituted with green or blue hydrogen without the need to change the process).

Potential material efficiency contribution for the EU is estimated to be much higher – 48% (Material Economics 2019). Recycling would cut the average CO2 emissions per tonne of steel produced by 60% (Material Economics 2019), but globally by 2050 secondary steel production is limited to 40–56% in various scenarios (IEA 2019b), with 46% in the IEA (2021a) and up to 56% in 2050 in Xylia et al.

wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The cement sector is regarded as a sector where mitigation options are especially narrow (Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Habert et al. 2020). Cement is used as the glue to hold together sand, gravel and stone aggregates to make concrete, the most consumed manufactured substance globally. The production of cement has been increasing faster than the global population since the middle of the last century (Scrivener et al. 2018). Despite significant improvements in energy efficiency over the last couple of decades (e.g., a systematic move from wet to dry kilns with calciner preheaters feeding off the kilns), the direct emissions of cement production (the sum of energy and process emissions) are estimated to be 2.1–2.5 GtCO2-eq in 2019 or 14–17% of total global direct industrial GHG emissions (Lehne and Preston 2018; Bataille 2020a; Sanjuán et al. 2020; Crippa et al. 2021; Hertwich 2021; Lamb et al. 2021) (Figure 11.4). Typically, about 40% of these direct emissions originate from process heating (e.g., for calcium carbonate (limestone) decomposition into calcium oxide at 850°C or higher, directly followed by combination with cementitious materials  at about 1450°C to make clinker), while 60% are process CO2 emissions from the calcium carbonate decomposition (Kajaste and Hurme 2016; IEA and WBCSD 2018; Andrew 2019). Some of the CO2 is reabsorbed into concrete products and can be seen as avoided during the decades-long life of the products; estimates of this flux vary between 15 and 30% of the direct emissions (Stripple et al. 2018; Andersson et al. 2019; Schneider 2019; Cao et al. 2020; GCCA 2021a). Some companies are mixing CO2 into hardening concrete, both to dispose of the CO2 and more importantly reduce the need for binder (Lim et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"One of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce cement and concrete emissions is to make stronger concrete through better mixing and aggregate sizing and dispersal; poorly and well-made concrete can vary in strength by a factor of four for a given volume (Fechner and Kray 2012; Habert et al. 2020). This argues for a refocus of the market away from ‘one size fits all’, often bagged cements to professionally mixed clinker, cementitious material and filler mixtures appropriate to the needs of the end use."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Architects, engineers and contractors also tend to overbuild with cement because it is cheap as well as corrosion- and water-resistant. Buildings and infrastructure can be purposefully designed to minimise cement use to its essential uses (e.g., compression strength and corrosion-resistance), and replace its use with other materials (e.g., wood, stone and other fibres) for non-essential uses. This could reduce cement use by 20–30% (Imbabi et al. 2012; Brinkerhoff and GLDNV 2015; D’Alessandro et al. 2016; Lehne and Preston 2018; IEA 2019b; Shanks et al. 2019; Habert et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Because so much of the emissions from concrete come from the limestone calcination to make clinker, anything that reduces use of clinker for a given amount of concrete reduces its GHG intensity. While 95% Portland cement is common in some markets, it is typically not necessary for all end-use applications, and many markets will add blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, or natural pozzolanic materials to replace cement as supplementary cementitious materials; 71% was the global average clinker content of cement in 2019 (IEA 2020a). All these materials are limited in volume, but a combination of roughly two to three parts ground limestone and one part specially selected, calcined clays can also be used to replace clinker (Fechner and Kray 2012; Lehne and Preston 2018; Habert et al. 2020). Local building codes determine what mixes of cementitious materials are allowed for given uses and would need to be modified to allow these alternative mixtures where appropriate."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Ordinary Portland cement process CO2 emissions cannot be avoided or reduced through the use of non-fossil energy sources. For this reason, CCS technology, which could capture just the process emissions (e.g., the EU LEILAC project, which concentrates the process emissions from the limestone calciner, see following paragraph) or both the energy and process-related CO2 emissions, is often mentioned as a potentially important element of an ambitious mitigation strategy in the cement sector. Different types of CCS processes can be deployed, including post-combustion technologies such as amine scrubbing and membrane-assisted CO2-liquefation, oxycombustion in a low-to-zero nitrogen environment (full or partial) to produce a concentrated CO2 stream for capture and disposal, or calcium-looping (Dean et al. 2011). The IEA puts cement CCS technologies at the technology readiness level (TRL) 6–8 (IEA 2020h). These approaches have different strengths and weaknesses concerning emission abatement potential, primary energy consumption, costs and retrofittability (Hills et al. 2016; Gardarsdottir et al. 2019; Voldsund et al. 2019). Use of biomass energy combined with CCS has the possibility of generating partial negative emissions, with the caveats introduced in Section11.3.6 (Hepburn et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"The energy-related emissions of cement production can also be reduced by using bioenergy solids, liquids or gases (TRL 9) (IEA and WBCSD 2018), hydrogen or electricity (TRL 4 according to IEA (2020h)) for generating the high-temperature heat at the calciner – hydrogen and bioenergy co-burning could be complementary due to their respective fast-vs-slow combustion characteristics. In an approach pursued by the LEILAC research project, the calcination process step is carried out in a steel vessel that is heated indirectly using natural gas (Hills et al. 2017). The LEILAC approach makes it possible to capture the process-related emissions in a comparatively pure CO2 stream, which reduces the energy required for CO2 capture and purification. This technology (LEILAC in combination with CCS) could reduce total furnace emissions by up to 85% compared with an unabated, fossil fuelled cement plant, depending on the type of energy sources used for heating (Hills et al. 2017). In principle, the LEILAC approach allows the eventual potential electrification of the calciner by electrically heating the steel enclosure instead of using fossil burners."

There are several highly regional alternative chemistries in use that provide partial reductions (Fechner and Kray 2012; Lehne and Preston 2018; Habert et al. 2020), for example, carbonatable calcium silicate clinkers, and there have been pilot projects with magnesium-oxide-based cements, which could be negative emissions. Lower carbon cement chemistries are not nearly as widely available as limestone deposits (Material Economics 2019), and would require new materials testing protocols, codes, pilots and demonstrations."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Any substantial changes in cement and concrete material efficiency or production decarbonisation, however, will require comprehensive education and continuing re-education for cement producers, architects, engineers, contractors and small, non-professional users of cements.

Even an end-of-pipe solution like CCS will require infrastructure for transport and disposal. Abatement costs for these strategies vary considerably from case to case and for each a plausible cost range is difficult to establish, but they are summarised in Table 11.3 from the following literature and other sources (Wilson et al. 2003; Fechner and Kray 2012; Leeson et al. 2017; Moore 2017; Lehne and Preston 2018; IEA 2019f; Habert et al. 2020)."

With regard to energy requirements and CO2 emissions, ammonia, methanol, olefins, and chlorine production are of great importance (Boulamanti and Moya Rivera 2017). Ammonia is primarily used for nitrogen fertilisers, methanol for adhesives, resins, and fuels, whereas olefins and chlorine are mainly used for the production of polymers, which are the main components of plastics."

Although energy efficiency in the sector has steadily improved over the past decades (Boulamanti and Moya Rivera 2017; IEA 2018a) (Figure 11.8), a significant share of the emissions is caused by the need for heat and steam in the production of primary chemicals (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017) (Box 11.2). This energy is currently supplied almost exclusively through fossil fuels which could be substituted with bioenergy, hydrogen, or low or zero carbon electricity, for example, using electric boilers or high-temperature heat pumps (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Thunman et al. 2019; Saygin and Gielen 2021). The chemical industry has among the largest potentials for industrial energy demand to be electrified with existing technologies, indicating the possibility for a rapid reduction of energy-related emissions (Madeddu et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The production of ammonia causes most CO2 emissions in the chemical industry, about 30% according to the IEA (2018a) and nearly one third according to Crippa et al. (2021), Lamb et al. (2021) and Minx et al. (2021). Ammonia is produced in a catalytic reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen – the latter most often produced through natural gas reforming (Stork et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019) and in some regions through coal gasification, which has several times higher associated CO2 emissions. Future low-carbon options include hydrogen from electrolysis using low- or zero-carbon energy sources (Philibert 2017a), natural gas reforming with CCS, or methane pyrolysis, a process in which methane is transformed into hydrogen and solid carbon (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Material Economics 2019; (Section 11.3.5 and Box 11.1). Electrifying ammonia production would lead to a decrease in total primary energy demand compared to conventional production, but a significant efficiency improvement potential remains in novel synthesis processes (Wang et al. 2018; Faria 2021). Combining renewable energy sources and flexibility measures in the production process could allow for low-carbon ammonia production on all continents (Fasihi et al. 2021). Steam cracking of naphtha and natural gas liquids for the production of olefins (i.e., ethylene, propylene and butylene), and other high-value chemicals is the second most CO2-emitting process in the chemical industry, accounting for another almost 20% of the emissions from the subsector (IEA 2018a). Future lower-carbon options include electrifying the heat supply in the steam cracker as described above, although this will not remove the associated process emissions from the cracking reaction itself or from the combustion of the by-products. Further in the future, electrocatalysis of carbon monoxide, methanol, ethanol, ethylene and formic acid could allow direct electric recombination of waste chemical products into new intermediate products (De Luna et al. 2019)."

Methane pyrolysis, electrified steam cracking, and the biomass-based routes for ethanol-to-ethylene and lignin-to-BTX were ranked as being of medium importance. While macro-level analyses show that large-scale use of carbon circulation through CCU is possible in the chemical industry as primary strategy, it would be very energy intensive and the climate impact depends significantly on the source of and process for capturing the CO2 (Artz et al. 2018; Kätelhön et al. 2019; Müller et al. 2020). Significant synergies can be found when combining circular CCU approaches with virgin carbon feedstocks from biomass (Bachmann et al. 2021; Meys et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In a net zero world carbon will still be needed for many chemical products, but the sector must also address the lifecycle emissions of its products which arise in the use phase, for example, CO2 released from urea fertilisers, or at the end of life, for example, the incineration of waste plastics which was estimated to emit 100 Mt globally in 2015 (Zheng and Suh 2019). Reducing lifecycle emissions can partly be achieved by closing the material cycles starting with material and product design planning for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling of products – ending up with chemical recycling which yields recycled feedstock that substitutes virgin feedstocks for various chemical processes (Rahimi and García 2017; Smet and Linder 2019).However, the chemical recycling processes which are most well-studied are pyrolytic processes which are energy intensive and have significant losses of carbon to off-gases and solid residues (Dogu et al. 2021; Davidson et al. 2021). They are thus associated with significant CO2 emissions, which can even be larger in systems with chemical recycling than energy recovery (Meys et al. 2020). Further, the products from many pyrolytic chemical recycling processes are primarily fuels, which then in their subsequent use will emit all contained carbon as CO2 (Vollmer et al. 2020). Achieving carbon neutrality would thus require this CO2 either to be recirculated through energy-consuming synthesis routes or to be captured and stored (Geyer et al. 2017; Lopez et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019; Thunman et al. 2019). As all chemical products are unlikely to fit into chemical recycling systems, CCS can be used to capture and store a large share of their end-of-life emissions when combined with waste combustion plants or heat-demanding facilities like cement kilns (Leeson et al. 2017; Tang and You 2018)."

Alternatively, waste plastics could be gasified and combined with low-carbon hydrogen to a syngas, for example, the production and methanol and derivatives (Lopez et al. 2018; Stork et al. 2018). Other chemical recycling options include polymer selective chemolysis, catalytic cracking, and hydrocracking (Ragaert et al. 2017).

The above-listed strategies all rely on low-carbon energy to reach near-zero emissions. In considering mitigation strategies for the sector it will be key to focus on those for which there is a clear path towards (close to) zero emissions, with high (carbon) yields over the full product value chain and minimal fossil resource use for both energy and feedstocks (Saygin and Gielen 2021), with CCU and CCS employed for all remnant carbon flows. The necessity of combining mitigation approaches in the chemicals industry with low-carbon energy was recently highlighted in an analysis (Figure 11.10) which showed how the combined use of different recycling options, carbon capture, and biomass feedstocks was most effective at reducing global lifecycle emissions from plastics (Meys et al. 2021). While most of the chemical processes for doing all the above are well known and have been used commercially at least partly, they have not been used at large scale and in an integrated way. In the past, external conditions (e.g., availability and price of fossil feedstocks) have not set the necessary incentives to implement alternative routes and to avoid emitting combustion- and process-related CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Most of these processes will very likely be more costly than using fossil fuels and full-scale commercialisation would require significant policy support and the implementation of dedicated lead markets (Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Material Economics 2019; Wyns et al. 2019). As in other subsectors, abatement costs for the various strategies vary considerably across regions and products, making it difficult to establish a plausible cost range for each (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Philibert 2017a; Philibert 2017b; Axelson et al. 2018; IEA 2018a; De Luna et al. 2019; Saygin and Gielen 2021)."

The global production of crude steel increased by 41% between 2008 and 2020 (World Steel Association 2021) and its GHG emissions, depending on the scope covered, is 3.7–4.1 GtCO2-eq.

Steel production can be divided into primary production based on iron ore and secondary production based on steel scrap. The blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace route (BF-BOF) is the main primary steel route globally, while the electric arc furnace (EAF) is the preferred process for the less energy and emissions-intensive melting and alloying of recycled steel scrap. The direct reduced iron (DRI) route is a lesser-used route that replaces BFs for reducing iron ore, usually followed by an EAF. In 2019, 73% of global crude steel production was produced in BF-BOFs, while 26% was produced in EAFs, a nominal 5.6% of which is DRI (World Steel Association 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,An estimated 15% energy efficiency improvement is possible within the BF-BOF process (Figure 11.8). Several options exist for deep-GHG emissions reductions in steel-production processes (Fischedick et al. 2014 b; Leeson et al. 2017; Axelson et al. 2018; Vogl et al. 2018; Bataille 2020a; Holappa 2020; Rissman et al. 2020; Fan and Friedmann 2021; Wang et al. 2021).Each could reduce specific CO2 emissions of primary steel production by 80% or more relative to today’s dominant BF-BOF route if input streams are based on carbon-free energy and feedstock sources or if they deploy high-capture CCS:
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"•Increasing the share of the secondary route can bring down emissions quickly and potential emissions savings are significant, from a global average 2.3 tCO2–1 per tonne steel in BF-BOFs down to 0.3 (or less) tCO2–1 per tonne steel in EAFs (Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Zhou et al. 2019), the latter depending on scrap preheating and electricity GHG intensity. However, realising this potential is dependent on the availability of regional and global scrap supplies and requires careful sorting and scrap management, especially to eliminate copper contamination (Daehn et al. 2017). There is significant uncertainty about how much new scrap will be available and usable (Xylia et al. 2018; IEA 2019b; Wang et al. 2021). Most steel is recycled already; the gains are mainly to be made in quality (i.e., separation from contaminants like copper). End-of-life scrap availability and its contribution to steel production will increase as in use stock saturates in many countries (Xylia et al. 2016)."

However, BF-BOFs need their furnaces relined every 15–25 years (IEA 2021a; Vogl et al. 2021b), at a cost of 80–100% of a new build, and this would be an opportunity to build a new facility designed for 90%+ capture (e.g., fewer CO2 outlets).

During a transitional period, DRI could start with methane or a mixture of methane and hydrogen as some of the methane (≤30% hydrogen can be substituted with green or blue hydrogen without the need to change the process).

This process is suitable to be combined with CCS technology because of its relatively easy to capture and pure CO2 exhaust gas flow. CO2 emission reductions of 80% are believed to be realisable relative to the conventional blast furnace route (Abdul Quader et al. 2016).

Potential material efficiency contribution for the EU is estimated to be much higher – 48% (Material Economics 2019). Recycling would cut the average CO2 emissions per tonne of steel produced by 60% (Material Economics 2019), but globally by 2050 secondary steel production is limited to 40–56% in various scenarios (IEA 2019b), with 46% in the IEA (2021a) and up to 56% in 2050 in Xylia et al.

wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The cement sector is regarded as a sector where mitigation options are especially narrow (Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Habert et al. 2020). Cement is used as the glue to hold together sand, gravel and stone aggregates to make concrete, the most consumed manufactured substance globally. The production of cement has been increasing faster than the global population since the middle of the last century (Scrivener et al. 2018). Despite significant improvements in energy efficiency over the last couple of decades (e.g., a systematic move from wet to dry kilns with calciner preheaters feeding off the kilns), the direct emissions of cement production (the sum of energy and process emissions) are estimated to be 2.1–2.5 GtCO2-eq in 2019 or 14–17% of total global direct industrial GHG emissions (Lehne and Preston 2018; Bataille 2020a; Sanjuán et al. 2020; Crippa et al. 2021; Hertwich 2021; Lamb et al. 2021) (Figure 11.4). Typically, about 40% of these direct emissions originate from process heating (e.g., for calcium carbonate (limestone) decomposition into calcium oxide at 850°C or higher, directly followed by combination with cementitious materials  at about 1450°C to make clinker), while 60% are process CO2 emissions from the calcium carbonate decomposition (Kajaste and Hurme 2016; IEA and WBCSD 2018; Andrew 2019). Some of the CO2 is reabsorbed into concrete products and can be seen as avoided during the decades-long life of the products; estimates of this flux vary between 15 and 30% of the direct emissions (Stripple et al. 2018; Andersson et al. 2019; Schneider 2019; Cao et al. 2020; GCCA 2021a). Some companies are mixing CO2 into hardening concrete, both to dispose of the CO2 and more importantly reduce the need for binder (Lim et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"One of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce cement and concrete emissions is to make stronger concrete through better mixing and aggregate sizing and dispersal; poorly and well-made concrete can vary in strength by a factor of four for a given volume (Fechner and Kray 2012; Habert et al. 2020). This argues for a refocus of the market away from ‘one size fits all’, often bagged cements to professionally mixed clinker, cementitious material and filler mixtures appropriate to the needs of the end use."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Architects, engineers and contractors also tend to overbuild with cement because it is cheap as well as corrosion- and water-resistant. Buildings and infrastructure can be purposefully designed to minimise cement use to its essential uses (e.g., compression strength and corrosion-resistance), and replace its use with other materials (e.g., wood, stone and other fibres) for non-essential uses. This could reduce cement use by 20–30% (Imbabi et al. 2012; Brinkerhoff and GLDNV 2015; D’Alessandro et al. 2016; Lehne and Preston 2018; IEA 2019b; Shanks et al. 2019; Habert et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Because so much of the emissions from concrete come from the limestone calcination to make clinker, anything that reduces use of clinker for a given amount of concrete reduces its GHG intensity. While 95% Portland cement is common in some markets, it is typically not necessary for all end-use applications, and many markets will add blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, or natural pozzolanic materials to replace cement as supplementary cementitious materials; 71% was the global average clinker content of cement in 2019 (IEA 2020a). All these materials are limited in volume, but a combination of roughly two to three parts ground limestone and one part specially selected, calcined clays can also be used to replace clinker (Fechner and Kray 2012; Lehne and Preston 2018; Habert et al. 2020). Local building codes determine what mixes of cementitious materials are allowed for given uses and would need to be modified to allow these alternative mixtures where appropriate."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Ordinary Portland cement process CO2 emissions cannot be avoided or reduced through the use of non-fossil energy sources. For this reason, CCS technology, which could capture just the process emissions (e.g., the EU LEILAC project, which concentrates the process emissions from the limestone calciner, see following paragraph) or both the energy and process-related CO2 emissions, is often mentioned as a potentially important element of an ambitious mitigation strategy in the cement sector. Different types of CCS processes can be deployed, including post-combustion technologies such as amine scrubbing and membrane-assisted CO2-liquefation, oxycombustion in a low-to-zero nitrogen environment (full or partial) to produce a concentrated CO2 stream for capture and disposal, or calcium-looping (Dean et al. 2011). The IEA puts cement CCS technologies at the technology readiness level (TRL) 6–8 (IEA 2020h). These approaches have different strengths and weaknesses concerning emission abatement potential, primary energy consumption, costs and retrofittability (Hills et al. 2016; Gardarsdottir et al. 2019; Voldsund et al. 2019). Use of biomass energy combined with CCS has the possibility of generating partial negative emissions, with the caveats introduced in Section11.3.6 (Hepburn et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"The energy-related emissions of cement production can also be reduced by using bioenergy solids, liquids or gases (TRL 9) (IEA and WBCSD 2018), hydrogen or electricity (TRL 4 according to IEA (2020h)) for generating the high-temperature heat at the calciner – hydrogen and bioenergy co-burning could be complementary due to their respective fast-vs-slow combustion characteristics. In an approach pursued by the LEILAC research project, the calcination process step is carried out in a steel vessel that is heated indirectly using natural gas (Hills et al. 2017). The LEILAC approach makes it possible to capture the process-related emissions in a comparatively pure CO2 stream, which reduces the energy required for CO2 capture and purification. This technology (LEILAC in combination with CCS) could reduce total furnace emissions by up to 85% compared with an unabated, fossil fuelled cement plant, depending on the type of energy sources used for heating (Hills et al. 2017). In principle, the LEILAC approach allows the eventual potential electrification of the calciner by electrically heating the steel enclosure instead of using fossil burners."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In the long run, if some combination of material efficiency, better mixing and aggregate sizing, cementitious material substitution and 90%+ capture CCS with supplemental bioenergy are not feasible in some regions or at all to achieve near-zero emissions, alternatives to limestone-based ordinary Portland cement may be needed. There are several highly regional alternative chemistries in use that provide partial reductions (Fechner and Kray 2012; Lehne and Preston 2018; Habert et al. 2020), for example, carbonatable calcium silicate clinkers, and there have been pilot projects with magnesium-oxide-based cements, which could be negative emissions. Lower carbon cement chemistries are not nearly as widely available as limestone deposits (Material Economics 2019), and would require new materials testing protocols, codes, pilots and demonstrations."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Any substantial changes in cement and concrete material efficiency or production decarbonisation, however, will require comprehensive education and continuing re-education for cement producers, architects, engineers, contractors and small, non-professional users of cements. It will also require changes to building codes, standards, certification, labeling, procurement, incentives, and a range of polices to help create the market will be needed, as well as those for information disclosure, and certification for quality. Even an end-of-pipe solution like CCS will require infrastructure for transport and disposal. Abatement costs for these strategies vary considerably from case to case and for each a plausible cost range is difficult to establish, but they are summarised in Table 11.3 from the following literature and other sources (Wilson et al. 2003; Fechner and Kray 2012; Leeson et al. 2017; Moore 2017; Lehne and Preston 2018; IEA 2019f; Habert et al. 2020)."

With regard to energy requirements and CO2 emissions, ammonia, methanol, olefins, and chlorine production are of great importance (Boulamanti and Moya Rivera 2017). Ammonia is primarily used for nitrogen fertilisers, methanol for adhesives, resins, and fuels, whereas olefins and chlorine are mainly used for the production of polymers, which are the main components of plastics."

Although energy efficiency in the sector has steadily improved over the past decades (Boulamanti and Moya Rivera 2017; IEA 2018a) (Figure 11.8), a significant share of the emissions is caused by the need for heat and steam in the production of primary chemicals (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017) (Box 11.2). This energy is currently supplied almost exclusively through fossil fuels which could be substituted with bioenergy, hydrogen, or low or zero carbon electricity, for example, using electric boilers or high-temperature heat pumps (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Thunman et al. 2019; Saygin and Gielen 2021). The chemical industry has among the largest potentials for industrial energy demand to be electrified with existing technologies, indicating the possibility for a rapid reduction of energy-related emissions (Madeddu et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The production of ammonia causes most CO2 emissions in the chemical industry, about 30% according to the IEA (2018a) and nearly one third according to Crippa et al. (2021), Lamb et al. (2021) and Minx et al. (2021). Ammonia is produced in a catalytic reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen – the latter most often produced through natural gas reforming (Stork et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019) and in some regions through coal gasification, which has several times higher associated CO2 emissions. Future low-carbon options include hydrogen from electrolysis using low- or zero-carbon energy sources (Philibert 2017a), natural gas reforming with CCS, or methane pyrolysis, a process in which methane is transformed into hydrogen and solid carbon (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Material Economics 2019; (Section 11.3.5 and Box 11.1). Electrifying ammonia production would lead to a decrease in total primary energy demand compared to conventional production, but a significant efficiency improvement potential remains in novel synthesis processes (Wang et al. 2018; Faria 2021). Combining renewable energy sources and flexibility measures in the production process could allow for low-carbon ammonia production on all continents (Fasihi et al. 2021). Steam cracking of naphtha and natural gas liquids for the production of olefins (i.e., ethylene, propylene and butylene), and other high-value chemicals is the second most CO2-emitting process in the chemical industry, accounting for another almost 20% of the emissions from the subsector (IEA 2018a). Future lower-carbon options include electrifying the heat supply in the steam cracker as described above, although this will not remove the associated process emissions from the cracking reaction itself or from the combustion of the by-products. Further in the future, electrocatalysis of carbon monoxide, methanol, ethanol, ethylene and formic acid could allow direct electric recombination of waste chemical products into new intermediate products (De Luna et al. 2019)."

While macro-level analyses show that large-scale use of carbon circulation through CCU is possible in the chemical industry as primary strategy, it would be very energy intensive and the climate impact depends significantly on the source of and process for capturing the CO2 (Artz et al. 2018; Kätelhön et al. 2019; Müller et al. 2020). Significant synergies can be found when combining circular CCU approaches with virgin carbon feedstocks from biomass (Bachmann et al. 2021; Meys et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In a net zero world carbon will still be needed for many chemical products, but the sector must also address the lifecycle emissions of its products which arise in the use phase, for example, CO2 released from urea fertilisers, or at the end of life, for example, the incineration of waste plastics which was estimated to emit 100 Mt globally in 2015 (Zheng and Suh 2019). Reducing lifecycle emissions can partly be achieved by closing the material cycles starting with material and product design planning for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling of products – ending up with chemical recycling which yields recycled feedstock that substitutes virgin feedstocks for various chemical processes (Rahimi and García 2017; Smet and Linder 2019).However, the chemical recycling processes which are most well-studied are pyrolytic processes which are energy intensive and have significant losses of carbon to off-gases and solid residues (Dogu et al. 2021; Davidson et al. 2021). They are thus associated with significant CO2 emissions, which can even be larger in systems with chemical recycling than energy recovery (Meys et al. 2020). Further, the products from many pyrolytic chemical recycling processes are primarily fuels, which then in their subsequent use will emit all contained carbon as CO2 (Vollmer et al. 2020). Achieving carbon neutrality would thus require this CO2 either to be recirculated through energy-consuming synthesis routes or to be captured and stored (Geyer et al. 2017; Lopez et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019; Thunman et al. 2019). As all chemical products are unlikely to fit into chemical recycling systems, CCS can be used to capture and store a large share of their end-of-life emissions when combined with waste combustion plants or heat-demanding facilities like cement kilns (Leeson et al. 2017; Tang and You 2018)."

In considering mitigation strategies for the sector it will be key to focus on those for which there is a clear path towards (close to) zero emissions, with high (carbon) yields over the full product value chain and minimal fossil resource use for both energy and feedstocks (Saygin and Gielen 2021), with CCU and CCS employed for all remnant carbon flows. The necessity of combining mitigation approaches in the chemicals industry with low-carbon energy was recently highlighted in an analysis (Figure 11.10) which showed how the combined use of different recycling options, carbon capture, and biomass feedstocks was most effective at reducing global lifecycle emissions from plastics (Meys et al. 2021). While most of the chemical processes for doing all the above are well known and have been used commercially at least partly, they have not been used at large scale and in an integrated way. In the past, external conditions (e.g., availability and price of fossil feedstocks) have not set the necessary incentives to implement alternative routes and to avoid emitting combustion- and process-related CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Most of these processes will very likely be more costly than using fossil fuels and full-scale commercialisation would require significant policy support and the implementation of dedicated lead markets (Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Material Economics 2019; Wyns et al. 2019). As in other subsectors, abatement costs for the various strategies vary considerably across regions and products, making it difficult to establish a plausible cost range for each (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Philibert 2017a; Philibert 2017b; Axelson et al. 2018; IEA 2018a; De Luna et al. 2019; Saygin and Gielen 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The other big sources of direct global industrial combustion and process CO2 emissions are light manufacturing and industry (9.7% in 2016), non-ferrous metals like aluminium (3.1%), pulp and paper (1.1%), and food and tobacco (1.9%) (Bataille 2020a; Crippa et al. 2021; Lamb et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Light manufacturing and industry represent a very diverse sector in terms of energy service needs (e.g., motive power, ventilation, drying, heating, compressed air, etc.) and it comprises both small and large plants in different geographical contexts. Most of the direct fossil fuel use is for heating and drying, and it can be replaced with low-GHG electricity through direct resistance, high-temperature heat pumps and mechanical vapour recompression, induction, infrared, or other electrothermal processes (Lechtenböhmer et al. 2016; Bamigbetan et al. 2017). Madeddu et al. (2020) argue up to 78% of Europe’s industrial energy requirements are electrifiable through existing commercial technologies and 99% with the addition of new technologies currently under development. Direct solar heating is possible for low temperature needs (<100°C) and concentrating solar for higher temperatures. Commercially available heat pumps can deliver 100°C–150°C but at least up to 280°C is feasible (Zühlsdorf et al. 2019). Plasma torches using electricity can be used where high temperatures (>1000°C) are required, but hydrogen, biogenic or synthetic combustible hydrocarbons (methane, methanol, ethanol, LPG, etc.) can also be used (Bataille et al. 2018a)."

Waste heat can be passed at lower and lower temperatures from facility to facility or circulated as low-grade steam or hot water, and boosted as necessary using heat pumps and direct heating. Such geographic clusters would also enable lower-cost infrastructure for hydrogen production and storage as well as CO2 gathering, transport and disposal (IEA 2019f)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Demand for aluminium comes from a variety of end uses where a reasonable cost, light-weight metal is desirable. It has historically been used in aircraft, window frames, strollers, and beverage containers. As fuel economy has become more desirable and design improvements have allowed crush bodies made of aluminium instead of steel, aluminium has become progressively more attractive for cars. Primary aluminium demand is total demand (100 Mt yr –1 in 2020) net of manufacturing waste reuse (14% of virgin and recycled input) and end-of-life recycling (about 20% of what reaches market). Primary aluminium consumption rose from under 20 Mt yr –1 in 1995 to over 66 Mt primary ingot production in 2020 (International Aluminium Institute change to 2021c). The International Aluminium Institute (2021a) expects total aluminium consumption to reach 150–290 Mt yr –1 by 2050 with primary aluminium contributing 69–170 Mt and secondary recycled 91–120 Mt (as in-use stock triples or quadruples). The OECD forecasts increases in demand by 2060 for primary aluminium to 139 Mt yr –1 and for secondary aluminium to 71 Mt yr –1 (OECD 2019a). Primary (as opposed to recycled) aluminium is generally made in a two-stage process, often geographically separated. In the first stage aluminium oxide is extracted from bauxite ore (often with other trace elements) using the Bayer hydrometallurgical process, which requires up to 200°C heat when sodium hydroxide is used to leach the aluminium oxide, and up to 1000°C for kilning. This is followed by electrolytic separation of the oxygen from the elemental aluminium using the Hall-Héroult process, by far the most energy-intense part of making aluminium. This process has large potential emissions from the electricity used (12.5 MWh per tonne aluminium BAT, 14–15 MWh per tonne average). From bauxite mine to aluminium ingot, reported total global average emissions are between 12 and 17.6 tCO2-eq per tonne of aluminium, depending on estimates and assumptions made 22  (Saevarsdottir et al. 2020). About 10% of this, 1.5 tonnes of direct CO2 per tonne of aluminium are currently emitted as the graphite electrodes are depleted and combine with oxygen, and if less than optimal conditions are maintained, perfluorocarbons can be emitted with widely varying GHG intensity, up to the equivalent of 2 tCO2-eq per tonne of aluminium. PFC emissions, however, have been greatly reduced globally and almost eliminated in well-run facilities. Aluminium, if it is not contaminated, is highly recyclable and requires 1/20 of the energy required to produce virgin aluminium; increasing aluminium recycling rates from the 20–25% global average is a key emissions reduction strategy (Haraldsson and Johansson 2018)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"The use of low- and zero-GHG electricity (e.g., historically from hydropower) can reduce the indirect emissions associated with making aluminium. A public-private partnership with financial support from the province of Québec and the Canadian federal government has recently announced a fundamental modification to the Hall-Héroult process by which the graphite electrode process emissions can be eliminated by substitution of inert electrodes. This technology is slated to be available in 2024 and is potentially retrofittable to existing facilities (Saevarsdottir et al. 2020)."

These processes have been used occasionally in the past but have generally not been used due to the relatively inexpensive nature of fossil fuels."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"The pulp and paper industry (PPI) is a small net-emitter of CO2,  assuming the feedstock is sustainably sourced (Chapter 7), but it has large emissions of biogenic CO2 from feedstock (700–800 Mt yr –1) (Tanzer et al. 2021). It includes pulp mills, integrated pulp and paper mills, and paper mills using virgin pulpwood and other fibre sources, residues and co-products from wood products manufacturing, and recycled paper as feedstock. Pulp mills typically have access to bioenergy in the chemical pulping processes to cover most or all of heat and electricity needs, for example, through chemicals recovery boilers and steam turbines in the kraft process. Mechanical pulping mainly uses electricity for energy; decarbonisation thus depends on grid emission factors. With the exception of the lime kiln in kraft pulp mills, process temperature needs are typically less than or equal to 150°C to 200°C, mainly steam for heating and drying. This means that this sector can be relatively easily decarbonised through continued energy efficiency, fuel switching and electrification, including use of high-temperature heat pumps (Ericsson and Nilsson 2018). Electrification of pulp mills could, in the longer term, make bio-residues currently used internally for energy, available as a carbon source for chemicals (Meys et al. 2021). The PPI also has the capabilities, resources and knowledge, to implement these changes. Inertia is mainly caused by equipment turnover rates, relative fuel and electricity prices, and the profitability of investments."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.4_p8,NO_TITLE,"A larger and more challenging issue is how the forestry industry can contribute to the decarbonisation of other sectors and how biogenic carbon will be used in a fossil-free society, for example, through developing the forest-based bioeconomy (Pülzl et al. 2014; Bauer 2018). In recent years the concept of biorefineries has gained increasing traction. Most examples involve innovations for taking by-products or diverting small streams to produce fuels, chemicals and bio-composites that can replace fossil-based products, but there is little common vision on what really constitutes a biorefinery (Bauer et al. 2017). Some of these options have limited scalability and the cellulose fibre remains the core product even in the relatively large shift from paper production to textiles fibre production."

For deep decarbonisation across all sectors, notably switching to biomass feedstock for fuels, organic chemicals and plastics, the availability of biogenic carbon (in biomass or as biogenic CO2; Chapter 7) becomes an issue. A scenario where biogenic carbon is CCU as feedstock implies large demands for hydrogen, completely new value chains and more closed carbon loops, all areas which are as yet largely unexplored (Ericsson 2017; Meys et al. 2021)."

An increasing body of research proposes deep decarbonisation pathways for energy-intensive industries (Figure 11.13). Bataille et al. (2018a) address the question of whether it is possible to reduce GHG emissions to very low, zero, or negative levels, and identifies preliminary technological and policy elements that may allow the transition, including the use of policy to drive technological innovation and uptake. Material Economics (2019), the IEA (2019b), the Energy Transitions Commission (2018) and Climate Action Tracker (CAT; 2020) take steps to identify pathways integrating energy efficiency, material efficiency, circular economy and innovative technologies options to cut GHG emissions across basic materials and value chains. The key conclusion is that net zero CO2 emissions from the largest sources (steel, plastics, ammonia, and cement) could be achieved by 2050 by deploying already available multiple options packaged in different ways (Davis et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019; UKCCC 2019b). The studies assume that for those technologies that have a kind of breakthrough technology status further technological development and significant cost reduction can be expected."

wg3_ch11_11.4.1.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Table 11.3 acknowledges that for many carbon-intensive products a large variety of novel processes, inputs and practices capable of providing very deep emission reductions are already available and emerging. However, their application is subject to different economic and structural limitations, therefore in the scenarios assuming deep decarbonisation by 2050–2060 different technological mixes can be observed (Section 11.4.2)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"While deep GHG emissions reduction potential is assessed for various regions, assessment of associated costs is limited to only a few regions; nevertheless those analyses may be illustrative at the global scale. UKCCC (2019b) provides costs assessments for different industrial subsectors (Table 11.3) for the UK. They provide three ranges: core, more ambitious, and when energy and material efficiency are limited. The core options range from 2–85 GBP2019 tCO2-eq –1 (e.g., reduction in GHG emissions by about 50% by 2050 applying energy efficiency (EE), ME, CCS, biomass and electrification). The more ambitious options are estimated  at 32–119 GBP2019 tCO2-eq –1 (e.g., 90% emissions reduction via widespread deployment of hydrogen, electrification or bioenergy for stationary industrial heat/combustion). Finally, costs range from 33–299 GBP tCO2-eq –1 when energy and material efficiency are limited."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"In Material Economics (2019), costs are provided for separate technologies and subsectors, and also by pathways, each including new industrial processes, circular economy and CCS components in different proportions, allowing for the transition to net zero industrial emission in the EU by 2050. That means that the study provides information about the three main mid- to long-term options which could enable a wide abatement of GHG emissions. Given different electricity-price scenarios, average abatement costs associated with the circular economy-dominated pathway are: 12–75 EUR2019 tCO2-eq –1; for the carbon capture-dominated pathway 79 EUR2019 tCO2-eq –1; and for the new processes-dominated scenario 91 EUR2019 tCO2-eq –1. Consequently, net-zero-emission pathways are about 3–25% costlier compared to the baseline (Material Economics 2019). According to the Energy Transitions Commission (2018), cement decarbonisation would cost on average USD110–130 tCO2–1 depending on the cost scenario. Rootzén and Johnsson (2016) state that CO2 avoidance costs for the cement industry vary from 25 to 110 EUR tCO2–1, depending on the capture option considered and on the assumptions made with respect to the different cost items involved. According to the Energy Transitions Commission (2018), steel can be decarbonised on average at USD60 tCO2–1, with highly varying costs depending on low-carbon electricity prices."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"For customers of final products, information on the potential impact of supply-side decarbonisation on final prices may be more useful than that of CO2 abatement costs. A different approach has been developed to assess the costs of mitigation by estimating the potential impacts of supply-side decarbonisation on final product prices. Material Economics (2019) shows that with deep decarbonisation, depending on the pathway, steel costs grow by 20–30%; plastics by 20–45%; ammonia by 15–60%; and cement (not concrete) by 70–115%. While these are large and problematic cost increases for material producers working with low margins in a competitive market, final end-use product price increases are far less, for example, a car becomes 0.5% more expensive, supported by both Rootzén and Johnsson (2016) and the Energy Transitions Commission (2018). For comparison, Rootzén and Johnsson (2017) found that decarbonising cement-making, while doubling the cost of cement, would add <1% to the costs of a residential building; the Energy Transitions Commission (2018) found concrete would be 10–30% more expensive, adding USD15,000 or 3% to the price of a house including land value. Finally, the IEA (2020a) estimated the impact on end-use prices are rather small, even in a net zero scenario; they find price increases of 0.2% for a car and 0.6% for a house, based on higher costs for steel and cement respectively."
wg3_ch11_11.4.1.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Thus, the price impact scales down going across the value chain and might be acceptable for a significant share of customers. However, it has to be reflected that the cumulative price increase could be more significant if several different zero-carbon materials (e.g., steel, plastics and aluminium) in the production process of a certain product have to be combined, indicating the importance of material efficiency being applied along with production decarbonisation."

This starts with showing the results of IAM-based scenarios followed by specific studies which provide much higher technological resolution and allow a much deeper look into the interplay of different mitigation strategies. The comparison of more technology-focused sector-based scenarios with top-down-oriented scenarios provides the opportunity for a reciprocal assessment across different modelling philosophies and helps to identify robust elements for the transformation of the sector. Only some of the scenarios available in the literature allow for at least rough estimates of the necessary investments and give direction about relevant investment cycles and potential risks of stranded or depreciated assets. In some specific cases cost comparisons can be translated into expected difference costs not only for the overall sector, but also for relevant materials or even consumer products."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,Chapter 3 conducted a comprehensive analysis of scenarios based on IAMs. The resulting database comprises more than 1000 model-based scenarios published in the literature. The scenarios span a broad range along temperature categories from rather baseline-like scenarios to the description of pathways that are compatible with the 1.5°C target. Comparative discussion of scenarios allows some insights with regard to the relevance of mitigation strategies for the industry sector (Figure 11.11).
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,The main results from the Chapter 3 analysis from an industry perspective are:
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"•While all scenarios show a decline in energy and carbon intensity over time, final energy demand and associated industry-related CO2 emissions increase in many scenarios. Only ambitious scenarios (category C1) show significant reduction in final energy demand in 2030, more or less constant demand in 2050, but increasing demand in 2100, driven by growing material use throughout the 21st century. While carbon intensity shrinks over time, energy related CO2-emissions decline after 2030 even in less ambitious scenarios, but particularly in those pursuing a temperature increase below 2°C. Reduction of CO2 emissions in the sector are achieved through a combination of technologies which includes nearly all options that have been discussed in this chapter (Sections 11.3 and 11.4.1). However, there are big differences with regard to the intensity by which the various options are implemented in the scenarios. This is particularly true for CCS for industrial applications and material efficiency and material demand management (i.e., service demand, service product intensity). The latter options are still under-represented in many global IAMs."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"•There are only a few scenarios which allow net-negative CO2 emissions for the industry for the second half of the century,  while most scenarios assessed (including the majority of 1.5°C scenarios) end up with still significant positive CO2 emissions. In comparison to the whole system most scenarios expect a slower decrease of industry-related emissions. "
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"In addition to the more aggregated discussion, the IAMs illustrative mitigation pathways (IMPs) allow a deeper look into the transformation pathways related to the scenarios. For the illustrative mitigation pathways (IMPs) approach, sets of scenarios have been selected which represent different levels of GHG mitigation ambitions, scenarios which rely on different key strategies or even exclude some mitigation options, represent delayed actions or SDG-oriented pathways. For more detailed information about the selection see Section 3.3.2. Figure 11.12 compares for a selected number of key variables the results of IMPs and puts them in the context of the whole sample of IAMs scenario results for three temperature categories."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"With growing mitigation ambition final energy demand is significantly lower in comparison of a current policy pathway (CurPol) and a scenario that explores the impact of further moderate actions (ModAct). Based on the underlying assumptions, scenarios IMP-SP and IMP-LD are characterised by the lowest final energy demand, triggered by high energy efficiency improvement rates as well as additional demand side measures, while a scenario with extensive use of CDR in the industry and the energy sectors to achieve net-negative emissions (IMP-Neg) leads to a significant increase in final energy demand. Scenario IMP-GS represents a pathway where mitigation action is gradually strengthened by 2030 compared to pre-COP 26 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) shows the lowest final energy demand. All ambitious IMPs show substantially increasing contributions from electricity, with electricity’s end-use share more than doubling for some of them by 2050 and more than tripling by 2100. The share of hydrogen shows a flatter curve for many scenarios, reaching 5% (IMP-Ren) in 2050 and up to 20% in 2100 for some scenarios (Ren, LD). Those scenarios that have a strong focus on renewable energy electrification show high shares of hydrogen in the sector. In comparison to sector-specific and national studies which show typically a range between 5 and 15% by 2050, many IAM IMPs expect hydrogen to play a less important role. Results for industrial CCS show a broad variety of contributions, with the GS scenario (where hydrogen is not relevant as a mitigation option) representing the upper bound to 2050, with almost 2 GtCO2 yr –1 captured and stored by 2050. Beyond 2050 the upper bound is associated with scenario IMP-Neg associated with extensive use of CDR in the industry and energy sectors to achieve net-negative emissions in the second half of the century – more than 6 GtCO2 yr –1 is captured and stored in 2100 (this represents roughly 60% of 2018 direct CO2 emissions of the sector)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 a number of studies providing a high technological level of detail for the industry sector have been released which describe how the industry sector can significantly reduce its GHG emissions until the middle of the century. Many of these studies try to specifically reflect the particular industry sector characteristics and barriers that hinder industry to follow an optimal transformation pathway. They vary in respect to different characteristics. In respect to their geographical scope, some studies analyse the prospects for industry sector decarbonisation on a global level (IEA 2017 a; Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; IEA 2020a, 2019b, 2020c; Tchung-Ming et al. 2018); regional level, for example, European Commission (2018) and Material Economics (2019); or country level – studies for China, from where most industry-related emissions come (e.g., Zhou et al. 2019). 23 In regard to sectoral scope, some studies include the entire industry sector, while others focus on selected GHG emission intensive sectors, such as steel, chemicals and/or concrete. Most of the scenarios focus solely on CO2 emissions, that is non-CO2 emissions of the industrial sector are neglected. 24 "
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Industry sector mitigation studies also differ in regard to whether they develop coherent scenarios or whether they focus on discussing and analysing selected key mitigation strategies, without deriving full energy and emission scenarios. Coherent scenarios are developed in IEA (2017); Energy Transitions Commission (2018); Grubler et al. (2018); Tchung-Ming et al. (2018); IEA (2019b, 2020a,c); IEA (2021a); and IRENA (2021) on the global level, and in Climact (2018); European Commission (2018); and Material Economics (2019) on the European level. Recent literature analysing selected key mitigation strategies, for example IEA (2019b) and Material Economics (2019) has focused either exclusively or to a large extent on analysing the potential of materials efficiency and circular economy measures to reduce the need for primary raw materials relative to a business-as-usual development. The IEA (2021a, 2020a) also provides deep insights in  to single mitigation strategies for the industry sector, particularly the role of CCS. The following discussion mainly concentrates on scenarios from the IEA. It has to be acknowledged that they only represent a small segment of the huge scenario family (see the scenario database in Chapter 3), but this approach enables to show the chronological evolution of scenarios coming from the same institution, using the same modelling approach (which allows a technology-rich analytical backcasting approach), but reflect additional requests that emerge over time (Table 11.5). In the 2DS scenario from the ‘Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP)’ study (IEA 2017), which intends to describe in great technological detail how the global energy system could transform by 2060 so as to be in line with limiting global warming to below 2°C, total CO2 emissions are 74% lower in 2060 than in 2014, while only 39% lower in the industry sector. The Beyond 2°C Scenario (B2DS) of the same study intends to show how far known clean energy technologies (including those that lead to negative emissions) could go if pushed to their practical limits, allowing the future temperature increase to be limited to ‘well below’ 2°C and lowering total CO2 emissions by 100% by 2060 and by 75% relative to 2014 in the industry sector."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Technologies penetration assumed in the CTS scenario by 2060 allows for an industrial emission cut of 45% from 2017 levels and a 50% cut against projected 2060 emissions in the Reference Technology Scenario (RTS) from the same study (IEA 2019b), similar to IEA’s 2DS scenario. Energy efficiency improvements and deployment of BATs contribute 46% to cumulative emission reduction in 2018–2060, while fuel switching  (15%), material efficiency (19%) and deployment of innovative processes (20%) provide the rest. IEA (2020a,c) which continues the Energy Technology Perspectives series include the new Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) to describe a trajectory for emissions consistent with reaching global ‘net zero’ CO2 emissions by around 2070. 25 In 2070 the net zero balance is reached through a compensation of the remaining CO2 emissions (fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes still lead to around 3 GtCO2) by a combination of BECCS and to a lesser degree direct air capture and storage. In IEA (2020c) the Faster Innovation Case (FIC) shows a possibility to reach a net zero emissions level globally already in 2050, assuming that technology development and market penetration can be significantly accelerated. Innovation plays a major role in this scenario as almost half of all the additional emissions reductions in 2050 relative to the reference case would be from technologies that are in an early stage of development and have not yet reached the market today (IEA 2020c). The most ambitious IEA scenario NZE2050 (IEA 2021a) describes a pathway reaching net zero emissions at system level by 2050. With 0.52 GtCO2 industry-related CO2 emissions (including process emissions) it ends up 94% below 2018 levels in 2050. Remaining emissions in the industry sector have to be compensated by negative emissions (e.g., via DAC)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Two studies complement the discussion of the IEA scenarios and are related to the IEA database. 26 The ETC Supply Side scenario builds on the ETP 2017 study, investigating additional emission reduction potentials in the emissions-intensive sectors such as heavy industry and heavy-duty transport so as to be able to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The LED scenario (Grubler et al. 2018) also builds on the ETP 2017 study, but focuses on the possible potential of very far-reaching efforts to reduce future material demand."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"A comparison of the different mitigation scenarios shows that they depend on how individual mitigation strategies in the industry sector (Figure 11.13) are assessed. The use of CCS, for example, is in many scenarios assessed as very important, while other scenarios indicate that ambitious mitigation levels can be achieved without CCS in the industry sector. CCS plays a major role in the B2DS scenario (3.2 GtCO2 in 2050), the ETC Supply Side scenario (5.4 GtCO2 in 2050) and the IEA (2020a, 2021a) scenarios (e.g., 2.8 Gt CO2 in NZE2050 in 2050, roughly one half of the captured CO2 is related to cement production), while it is explicitly excluded in the LED scenario. In the latter scenario, on the other hand, considerable emission reductions are assumed to be achieved by far-reaching reductions in material demand relative to a baseline development. In other words, the analysed scenarios also suggest that to reach very strong emission reductions from the industry sector either CCS needs to be deployed to a great extent or considerable material demand reductions will need to be realised. Such demand reductions only play a minor role in the 2DS scenario and no role in the ETC Supply Side scenario. The SDS described in IEA (2020a) provides a pathway where both CCS and material efficiency contribute significantly. In SDS material efficiency is a relevant factor in several parts of industry, explicitly steel, cement, and chemicals. Combining the different material efficiency options including a substantial part lifetime extension (particularly of buildings) leads to 29% less steel production by 2070, 26% less cement production, and 25% less chemicals production respectively in comparison to the reference line used in the study (Stated Policy Scenario: STEPS). Sector- or subsector-specific analysis supports the growing role of material efficiency. For the global chemical and petrochemical sector, Saygin and Gielen (2021) point out that circular economy (including recycling) has to cover 16% of the necessary reduction that is needed for the implementation of a 1.5°C scenario."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In all scenarios, the relevance of biomass and electricity in industrial final energy demand increases, especially in the more ambitious scenarios NZE2050, SDS, ETC Supply Side and LED. While in all scenarios, electrification becomes more and more important, hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels, on the other hand, do not contribute to industrial final energy demand by the middle of the century in 2DS and B2DS, while LED (1% final energy share in 2050) and particularly ETC Supply Side (25% final energy share in 2050) consider hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels as a significant option. In the updated IEA scenarios hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels already play a more important role. In the SDS share in industry, final energy is around 10% (IEA 2020a) and in the Faster Innovation Case around 12% (IEA 2020c) in 2050. In the latter case this is based on the assumption that by 2050 on average each year 22 hydrogen-based steel plants come into operation (IEA 2020c). In SDS around 60% of the hydrogen is produced on-site via water electrolysis while the remaining 40% is generated in fossil fuel plants (methane reforming) coupled with CCS facilities. In the NZE2050 scenario biomass/biomethane (13%/3%), hydrogen (3%), natural gas with CCUS (4%), and coal with CCUS (4%) are responsible for 27% of the final energy demand of the sector. This is much more than in 2018, starting here from roughly 6% (only biomass). Direct use of electricity still plays a bigger role in the analysis, as share of electricity increases in NZE2050 from 22% in 2018 to 28% in 2030 and 46% in 2050 (with 15% a part of the electricity is used to produce hydrogen). This is reflecting the effect that since the publication of older IEA reports more direct electric applications for the sector become available. In NZE2050 approximately 25% of total heat used in the sector is electrified directly with heat pumps or indirectly with synthetic fuels already by 2030."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"For B2DS it is assumed that most of the available abatement options in the industry sector are pushed to their feasible limits. That leads to cumulative direct CO2 emissions reductions compared to 2DS which come from: energy efficiency improvements and BAT deployment (42%), innovative processes and CCS (37%), switching to lower carbon fuels and feedstocks (13%), and material efficiency strategies in manufacturing processes (8%). Energy efficiency improvements are particularly important in the first time period."

For many energy-intensive industries annual efficiency gains have to be almost doubled (e.g., from 0.6% yr –1 to 1.0% yr –1 for cement production) to contribute sufficiently to the overall goal. If net zero CO2 emissions should be achieved already by 2050 as pursued in the NZE2050 scenario (IEA 2020i, 2021c) further accelerating energy efficiency improvements are necessary (e.g., for cement, annual efficiency gains of 1.75%), leading to the effect that in 2030 many processes are implemented closely to their technological limits. In total, sector final energy demand can be held nearly constant at 2018 levels until 2050 and decoupled from product demand growth."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"The comparative analysis leads to the point that the relevance of individual mitigation strategies in different scenarios depends not only on a scenario’s level of ambition. Instead, implicit or explicit assumptions about: (i) the costs associated with each strategy, (ii) future technological progress and availability of individual technologies, and (iii) the future public or political acceptance of individual strategies are likely to be main reasons for the observed differences between the analysed scenarios. For many energy-intensive products, technologies capable of deep emission cuts are already available. Their application is subject to different economic and resources constraints (incremental investment needs, product prices escalation, requirements for escalation of new low-carbon power generation). To fully exploit potential availability of carbon-free energy sources (e.g., electricity or hydrogen and related derivates) is a fundamental prerequisite and marks the strong interdependencies between the industry and the energy sector."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Assessment of the scenario literature allows to conclude that under specific conditions strong CO2-emission reductions in the industry sector by 2050–2070 and even net-zero-emission pathways are possible. However, there is no consensus on the most plausible or most desirable mix of key mitigation strategies to be pursued. In addition it has to be stressed that suitable pathways are very country-specific and depend on the economic structure, resource potentials, technological competences, and political preferences and processes of the country or region in question (Bataille 2020a)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"There is a consensus among the scenarios that a significant shift is needed from a transition process in the past mainly based on marginal (incremental) changes (with a strong focus on energy efficiency efforts) to one based on transformational change. To limit the barriers that are associated with transformational change, besides overcoming the valley of death for technologies or processes with breakthrough character, it is required to carefully identify structural change processes which are connected with substantial changes of the existing system (including the whole process chain). This has to be done at an early stage and has to be linked with considerations about preparatory measures which are able to flank the changes and to foster the establishment of new structures (Section 11.6). The right sequencing of the various mitigation options and building appropriate bridges between the different strategies are important. Rissman et al. (2020) proposes three phases of technologies deployment for the industry sector: (i) energy/material efficiency improvement (mainly incremental) and electrification in combination with demonstration projects for new technologies potentially important in subsequent phases (2020–2035), (ii) structural shifts based on technologies which reach maturity in phase (i) such as CCS and alternative materials (2035–2050), (iii) widespread deployment for technologies that are nascent today like molten oxide electrolysis-based steel-making. There are no strong boundaries between the different phases and all phases have to be accompanied by effective policies like R&D programmes and market pull incentives."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p13,NO_TITLE,"Taking the steel sector as an illustrative example, sector-specific scenarios examining the possibility to reach GHG reduction beyond 80% (CAT 2020; Bataille et al. 2021b; IEA 2021a; Vogl et al. 2021b) indicate that robust measures comprise direct reduction of iron (DRI) with hydrogen in combination with efforts to further close the loops and increase availability of scrap metal (reducing the demand for primary steel). As hydrogen-based DRI might not be a fully mature technology before 2030 (depending on further developments of the policy framework and technological progress), risk of path dependencies has to be taken into consideration when reinvestments in existing production capacities will be required in the coming years. For existing plants, implementation of energy efficiency measures (e.g., utilisation of waste heat, improvement of high-temperature pumps) could build a bridge for further mitigation measures but have only limited unexhausted potential. As many GHG mitigation measures are associated with high investment costs and missing operating experience, a step-by-step implementing process might be an appropriate strategy to avoid investment leakage (given the mostly long operation times, investment cycles have to be used so as not to miss opportunities) and to gain experience. In the case of steel, companies can start with the integration of a natural gas-based direct reduced iron furnace feeding the reduced iron to an existing blast furnace, blending and later replacing the natural gas by hydrogen in a second stage, and later transitioning to a full hydrogen DRI EAF or molten oxide electrolysis EAF, all without disturbing the local upstream and downstream supply chains."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"It is worth mentioning the flexibility of implementing transformational changes not the least depends on the age profile and projected longevity of existing capital stock, especially the willingness to accept the intentional or market-based stranding of high GHG intensity investments. This is a relevant aspect in all producing countries, but particularly in those countries with a rather young industry structure (i.e., comparative low age of existing facilities on average). Tong et al. (2019) suggest that in China, using the survival rate as a proxy, less than 10% of existing cement or steel production facilities will reach their end of operation time by 2050. Vogl et al. (2021b) argue that the mean blast furnace campaign is considerably shorter than used in Tong et al.(2019), at only 17 years between furnace relining, which suggests there is more room for retrofitting with clean steel major process technologies than generally assumed. Bataille et al. (2021b) found if very low carbon intensity processes were mandatory starting in 2025, given the lifetimes of existing facilities, major steel process lifetimes of up to 27 years would still make a full retrofit cycle with low-carbon processes possible. 27 "
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"In general, early adoption of new technologies plays a major role. Considering the long operation time (lifetime) of industrial facilities (e.g., steel mills and cement kilns) early adoption of new technologies is needed to avoid lock-in. For the SDS 2020 scenario, the IEA (2020h) calculated the potential cumulative reduction of CO2 emissions from the steel, cement and chemicals sector to be around 57 GtCO2 if production technology is changed at its first mandatory retrofit, typically 25 years, rather than at 40 years (typical retrofitted lifetime) (Figure 11.14). Net zero pathways require that the new facilities are based on zero- or near-zero emissions technologies from 2030 onwards (IEA 2021c)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p16,NO_TITLE,"Another important finding is that material efficiency and demand management are still not well represented in the scenario literature. Besides IEA (2020a) two of the few exceptions are Material Economics (2019) for the EU and Zhou et al. (2019) for China. Zhou et al. (2019) describe a consistent mitigation pathway (Reinventing Fire scenario) for China where in 2050 CO2 emissions are at a level 42% below 2010 emissions. Around 13% of the reduction is related to less material demand, mainly based on extension of building and infrastructure lifetime, as well as reduction of material losses in the production process and application of higher quality materials particularly high-quality cement (Zhou et al. 2019). For buildings and cars, Pauliuk et al. (2021) analysed the potential role of material efficiency and demand management strategies on material demand to be covered by the industry sector."

wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p22,NO_TITLE,"While sector-specific cost analyses  are rare in general, there are scenarios indicating that pathways to net zero CO2 emissions in the emissions-intensive sectors can be realised with limited additional costs. According to the Energy Transitions Commission (2018), deep decarbonisation from four major industry subsectors (plastics, steel, aluminium and cement) is achievable on a global level with cumulative incremental capital investments (2015–2050) limited to about 0.1% of aggregate GDP over that period. UKCCC (2019a) assesses that total incremental costs (compared to a theoretical scenario with no climate change policy action at all) for cutting industrial emissions by 90% by 2050 is 0.2% of expected 2050 UK GDP (UKCCC 2019a). The additional investment is 0.2% of gross fixed capital formation (Material Economics 2019). The IEA (2020a) indicates the required annual incremental global investment in heavy industry is approximately 40 billion 2019USD yr –1 moving from STEPS to the SDS scenario (2020–2040), rising to USD55 billion yr –1 (2040–2070), effectively 0.05–0.07% of global annual GDP today."

wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,Chapter 3 conducted a comprehensive analysis of scenarios based on IAMs. The resulting database comprises more than 1000 model-based scenarios published in the literature. The scenarios span a broad range along temperature categories from rather baseline-like scenarios to the description of pathways that are compatible with the 1.5°C target. Comparative discussion of scenarios allows some insights with regard to the relevance of mitigation strategies for the industry sector (Figure 11.11).
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,The main results from the Chapter 3 analysis from an industry perspective are:
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"•While all scenarios show a decline in energy and carbon intensity over time, final energy demand and associated industry-related CO2 emissions increase in many scenarios. Only ambitious scenarios (category C1) show significant reduction in final energy demand in 2030, more or less constant demand in 2050, but increasing demand in 2100, driven by growing material use throughout the 21st century. While carbon intensity shrinks over time, energy related CO2-emissions decline after 2030 even in less ambitious scenarios, but particularly in those pursuing a temperature increase below 2°C. Reduction of CO2 emissions in the sector are achieved through a combination of technologies which includes nearly all options that have been discussed in this chapter (Sections 11.3 and 11.4.1). However, there are big differences with regard to the intensity by which the various options are implemented in the scenarios. This is particularly true for CCS for industrial applications and material efficiency and material demand management (i.e., service demand, service product intensity). The latter options are still under-represented in many global IAMs."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"•There are only a few scenarios which allow net-negative CO2 emissions for the industry for the second half of the century,  while most scenarios assessed (including the majority of 1.5°C scenarios) end up with still significant positive CO2 emissions. In comparison to the whole system most scenarios expect a slower decrease of industry-related emissions. "
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"In addition to the more aggregated discussion, the IAMs illustrative mitigation pathways (IMPs) allow a deeper look into the transformation pathways related to the scenarios. For the illustrative mitigation pathways (IMPs) approach, sets of scenarios have been selected which represent different levels of GHG mitigation ambitions, scenarios which rely on different key strategies or even exclude some mitigation options, represent delayed actions or SDG-oriented pathways. For more detailed information about the selection see Section 3.3.2. Figure 11.12 compares for a selected number of key variables the results of IMPs and puts them in the context of the whole sample of IAMs scenario results for three temperature categories."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"With growing mitigation ambition final energy demand is significantly lower in comparison of a current policy pathway (CurPol) and a scenario that explores the impact of further moderate actions (ModAct). Based on the underlying assumptions, scenarios IMP-SP and IMP-LD are characterised by the lowest final energy demand, triggered by high energy efficiency improvement rates as well as additional demand side measures, while a scenario with extensive use of CDR in the industry and the energy sectors to achieve net-negative emissions (IMP-Neg) leads to a significant increase in final energy demand. Scenario IMP-GS represents a pathway where mitigation action is gradually strengthened by 2030 compared to pre-COP 26 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) shows the lowest final energy demand. All ambitious IMPs show substantially increasing contributions from electricity, with electricity’s end-use share more than doubling for some of them by 2050 and more than tripling by 2100. The share of hydrogen shows a flatter curve for many scenarios, reaching 5% (IMP-Ren) in 2050 and up to 20% in 2100 for some scenarios (Ren, LD). Those scenarios that have a strong focus on renewable energy electrification show high shares of hydrogen in the sector. In comparison to sector-specific and national studies which show typically a range between 5 and 15% by 2050, many IAM IMPs expect hydrogen to play a less important role. Results for industrial CCS show a broad variety of contributions, with the GS scenario (where hydrogen is not relevant as a mitigation option) representing the upper bound to 2050, with almost 2 GtCO2 yr –1 captured and stored by 2050. Beyond 2050 the upper bound is associated with scenario IMP-Neg associated with extensive use of CDR in the industry and energy sectors to achieve net-negative emissions in the second half of the century – more than 6 GtCO2 yr –1 is captured and stored in 2100 (this represents roughly 60% of 2018 direct CO2 emissions of the sector)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 a number of studies providing a high technological level of detail for the industry sector have been released which describe how the industry sector can significantly reduce its GHG emissions until the middle of the century. Many of these studies try to specifically reflect the particular industry sector characteristics and barriers that hinder industry to follow an optimal transformation pathway. They vary in respect to different characteristics. In respect to their geographical scope, some studies analyse the prospects for industry sector decarbonisation on a global level (IEA 2017 a; Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; IEA 2020a, 2019b, 2020c; Tchung-Ming et al. 2018); regional level, for example, European Commission (2018) and Material Economics (2019); or country level – studies for China, from where most industry-related emissions come (e.g., Zhou et al. 2019). 23 In regard to sectoral scope, some studies include the entire industry sector, while others focus on selected GHG emission intensive sectors, such as steel, chemicals and/or concrete. Most of the scenarios focus solely on CO2 emissions, that is non-CO2 emissions of the industrial sector are neglected. 24 "
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Industry sector mitigation studies also differ in regard to whether they develop coherent scenarios or whether they focus on discussing and analysing selected key mitigation strategies, without deriving full energy and emission scenarios. Coherent scenarios are developed in IEA (2017); Energy Transitions Commission (2018); Grubler et al. (2018); Tchung-Ming et al. (2018); IEA (2019b, 2020a,c); IEA (2021a); and IRENA (2021) on the global level, and in Climact (2018); European Commission (2018); and Material Economics (2019) on the European level. Recent literature analysing selected key mitigation strategies, for example IEA (2019b) and Material Economics (2019) has focused either exclusively or to a large extent on analysing the potential of materials efficiency and circular economy measures to reduce the need for primary raw materials relative to a business-as-usual development. The IEA (2021a, 2020a) also provides deep insights in  to single mitigation strategies for the industry sector, particularly the role of CCS. The following discussion mainly concentrates on scenarios from the IEA. It has to be acknowledged that they only represent a small segment of the huge scenario family (see the scenario database in Chapter 3), but this approach enables to show the chronological evolution of scenarios coming from the same institution, using the same modelling approach (which allows a technology-rich analytical backcasting approach), but reflect additional requests that emerge over time (Table 11.5). In the 2DS scenario from the ‘Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP)’ study (IEA 2017), which intends to describe in great technological detail how the global energy system could transform by 2060 so as to be in line with limiting global warming to below 2°C, total CO2 emissions are 74% lower in 2060 than in 2014, while only 39% lower in the industry sector. The Beyond 2°C Scenario (B2DS) of the same study intends to show how far known clean energy technologies (including those that lead to negative emissions) could go if pushed to their practical limits, allowing the future temperature increase to be limited to ‘well below’ 2°C and lowering total CO2 emissions by 100% by 2060 and by 75% relative to 2014 in the industry sector."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Technologies penetration assumed in the CTS scenario by 2060 allows for an industrial emission cut of 45% from 2017 levels and a 50% cut against projected 2060 emissions in the Reference Technology Scenario (RTS) from the same study (IEA 2019b), similar to IEA’s 2DS scenario. Energy efficiency improvements and deployment of BATs contribute 46% to cumulative emission reduction in 2018–2060, while fuel switching  (15%), material efficiency (19%) and deployment of innovative processes (20%) provide the rest. IEA (2020a,c) which continues the Energy Technology Perspectives series include the new Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) to describe a trajectory for emissions consistent with reaching global ‘net zero’ CO2 emissions by around 2070. 25 In 2070 the net zero balance is reached through a compensation of the remaining CO2 emissions (fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes still lead to around 3 GtCO2) by a combination of BECCS and to a lesser degree direct air capture and storage. In IEA (2020c) the Faster Innovation Case (FIC) shows a possibility to reach a net zero emissions level globally already in 2050, assuming that technology development and market penetration can be significantly accelerated. Innovation plays a major role in this scenario as almost half of all the additional emissions reductions in 2050 relative to the reference case would be from technologies that are in an early stage of development and have not yet reached the market today (IEA 2020c). The most ambitious IEA scenario NZE2050 (IEA 2021a) describes a pathway reaching net zero emissions at system level by 2050. With 0.52 GtCO2 industry-related CO2 emissions (including process emissions) it ends up 94% below 2018 levels in 2050. Remaining emissions in the industry sector have to be compensated by negative emissions (e.g., via DAC)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Two studies complement the discussion of the IEA scenarios and are related to the IEA database. 26 The ETC Supply Side scenario builds on the ETP 2017 study, investigating additional emission reduction potentials in the emissions-intensive sectors such as heavy industry and heavy-duty transport so as to be able to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The LED scenario (Grubler et al. 2018) also builds on the ETP 2017 study, but focuses on the possible potential of very far-reaching efforts to reduce future material demand."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"A comparison of the different mitigation scenarios shows that they depend on how individual mitigation strategies in the industry sector (Figure 11.13) are assessed. The use of CCS, for example, is in many scenarios assessed as very important, while other scenarios indicate that ambitious mitigation levels can be achieved without CCS in the industry sector. CCS plays a major role in the B2DS scenario (3.2 GtCO2 in 2050), the ETC Supply Side scenario (5.4 GtCO2 in 2050) and the IEA (2020a, 2021a) scenarios (e.g., 2.8 Gt CO2 in NZE2050 in 2050, roughly one half of the captured CO2 is related to cement production), while it is explicitly excluded in the LED scenario. In the latter scenario, on the other hand, considerable emission reductions are assumed to be achieved by far-reaching reductions in material demand relative to a baseline development. In other words, the analysed scenarios also suggest that to reach very strong emission reductions from the industry sector either CCS needs to be deployed to a great extent or considerable material demand reductions will need to be realised. Such demand reductions only play a minor role in the 2DS scenario and no role in the ETC Supply Side scenario. The SDS described in IEA (2020a) provides a pathway where both CCS and material efficiency contribute significantly. In SDS material efficiency is a relevant factor in several parts of industry, explicitly steel, cement, and chemicals. Combining the different material efficiency options including a substantial part lifetime extension (particularly of buildings) leads to 29% less steel production by 2070, 26% less cement production, and 25% less chemicals production respectively in comparison to the reference line used in the study (Stated Policy Scenario: STEPS). Sector- or subsector-specific analysis supports the growing role of material efficiency. For the global chemical and petrochemical sector, Saygin and Gielen (2021) point out that circular economy (including recycling) has to cover 16% of the necessary reduction that is needed for the implementation of a 1.5°C scenario."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In all scenarios, the relevance of biomass and electricity in industrial final energy demand increases, especially in the more ambitious scenarios NZE2050, SDS, ETC Supply Side and LED. While in all scenarios, electrification becomes more and more important, hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels, on the other hand, do not contribute to industrial final energy demand by the middle of the century in 2DS and B2DS, while LED (1% final energy share in 2050) and particularly ETC Supply Side (25% final energy share in 2050) consider hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels as a significant option. In the updated IEA scenarios hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels already play a more important role. In the SDS share in industry, final energy is around 10% (IEA 2020a) and in the Faster Innovation Case around 12% (IEA 2020c) in 2050. In the latter case this is based on the assumption that by 2050 on average each year 22 hydrogen-based steel plants come into operation (IEA 2020c). In SDS around 60% of the hydrogen is produced on-site via water electrolysis while the remaining 40% is generated in fossil fuel plants (methane reforming) coupled with CCS facilities. In the NZE2050 scenario biomass/biomethane (13%/3%), hydrogen (3%), natural gas with CCUS (4%), and coal with CCUS (4%) are responsible for 27% of the final energy demand of the sector. This is much more than in 2018, starting here from roughly 6% (only biomass). Direct use of electricity still plays a bigger role in the analysis, as share of electricity increases in NZE2050 from 22% in 2018 to 28% in 2030 and 46% in 2050 (with 15% a part of the electricity is used to produce hydrogen). This is reflecting the effect that since the publication of older IEA reports more direct electric applications for the sector become available. In NZE2050 approximately 25% of total heat used in the sector is electrified directly with heat pumps or indirectly with synthetic fuels already by 2030."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"For B2DS it is assumed that most of the available abatement options in the industry sector are pushed to their feasible limits. That leads to cumulative direct CO2 emissions reductions compared to 2DS which come from: energy efficiency improvements and BAT deployment (42%), innovative processes and CCS (37%), switching to lower carbon fuels and feedstocks (13%), and material efficiency strategies in manufacturing processes (8%). Energy efficiency improvements are particularly important in the first time period."

For many energy-intensive industries annual efficiency gains have to be almost doubled (e.g., from 0.6% yr –1 to 1.0% yr –1 for cement production) to contribute sufficiently to the overall goal. If net zero CO2 emissions should be achieved already by 2050 as pursued in the NZE2050 scenario (IEA 2020i, 2021c) further accelerating energy efficiency improvements are necessary (e.g., for cement, annual efficiency gains of 1.75%), leading to the effect that in 2030 many processes are implemented closely to their technological limits.

wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"There is a consensus among the scenarios that a significant shift is needed from a transition process in the past mainly based on marginal (incremental) changes (with a strong focus on energy efficiency efforts) to one based on transformational change. To limit the barriers that are associated with transformational change, besides overcoming the valley of death for technologies or processes with breakthrough character, it is required to carefully identify structural change processes which are connected with substantial changes of the existing system (including the whole process chain). This has to be done at an early stage and has to be linked with considerations about preparatory measures which are able to flank the changes and to foster the establishment of new structures (Section 11.6). The right sequencing of the various mitigation options and building appropriate bridges between the different strategies are important. Rissman et al. (2020) proposes three phases of technologies deployment for the industry sector: (i) energy/material efficiency improvement (mainly incremental) and electrification in combination with demonstration projects for new technologies potentially important in subsequent phases (2020–2035), (ii) structural shifts based on technologies which reach maturity in phase (i) such as CCS and alternative materials (2035–2050), (iii) widespread deployment for technologies that are nascent today like molten oxide electrolysis-based steel-making. There are no strong boundaries between the different phases and all phases have to be accompanied by effective policies like R&D programmes and market pull incentives."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p13,NO_TITLE,"Taking the steel sector as an illustrative example, sector-specific scenarios examining the possibility to reach GHG reduction beyond 80% (CAT 2020; Bataille et al. 2021b; IEA 2021a; Vogl et al. 2021b) indicate that robust measures comprise direct reduction of iron (DRI) with hydrogen in combination with efforts to further close the loops and increase availability of scrap metal (reducing the demand for primary steel). As hydrogen-based DRI might not be a fully mature technology before 2030 (depending on further developments of the policy framework and technological progress), risk of path dependencies has to be taken into consideration when reinvestments in existing production capacities will be required in the coming years. For existing plants, implementation of energy efficiency measures (e.g., utilisation of waste heat, improvement of high-temperature pumps) could build a bridge for further mitigation measures but have only limited unexhausted potential. As many GHG mitigation measures are associated with high investment costs and missing operating experience, a step-by-step implementing process might be an appropriate strategy to avoid investment leakage (given the mostly long operation times, investment cycles have to be used so as not to miss opportunities) and to gain experience. In the case of steel, companies can start with the integration of a natural gas-based direct reduced iron furnace feeding the reduced iron to an existing blast furnace, blending and later replacing the natural gas by hydrogen in a second stage, and later transitioning to a full hydrogen DRI EAF or molten oxide electrolysis EAF, all without disturbing the local upstream and downstream supply chains."
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"It is worth mentioning the flexibility of implementing transformational changes not the least depends on the age profile and projected longevity of existing capital stock, especially the willingness to accept the intentional or market-based stranding of high GHG intensity investments. This is a relevant aspect in all producing countries, but particularly in those countries with a rather young industry structure (i.e., comparative low age of existing facilities on average). Tong et al. (2019) suggest that in China, using the survival rate as a proxy, less than 10% of existing cement or steel production facilities will reach their end of operation time by 2050. Vogl et al. (2021b) argue that the mean blast furnace campaign is considerably shorter than used in Tong et al.(2019), at only 17 years between furnace relining, which suggests there is more room for retrofitting with clean steel major process technologies than generally assumed. Bataille et al. (2021b) found if very low carbon intensity processes were mandatory starting in 2025, given the lifetimes of existing facilities, major steel process lifetimes of up to 27 years would still make a full retrofit cycle with low-carbon processes possible. 27 "
wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"In general, early adoption of new technologies plays a major role. Considering the long operation time (lifetime) of industrial facilities (e.g., steel mills and cement kilns) early adoption of new technologies is needed to avoid lock-in. For the SDS 2020 scenario, the IEA (2020h) calculated the potential cumulative reduction of CO2 emissions from the steel, cement and chemicals sector to be around 57 GtCO2 if production technology is changed at its first mandatory retrofit, typically 25 years, rather than at 40 years (typical retrofitted lifetime) (Figure 11.14). Net zero pathways require that the new facilities are based on zero- or near-zero emissions technologies from 2030 onwards (IEA 2021c)."

(2019) describe a consistent mitigation pathway (Reinventing Fire scenario) for China where in 2050 CO2 emissions are at a level 42% below 2010 emissions. Around 13% of the reduction is related to less material demand, mainly based on extension of building and infrastructure lifetime, as well as reduction of material losses in the production process and application of higher quality materials particularly high-quality cement (Zhou et al. 2019). For buildings and cars, Pauliuk et al. (2021) analysed the potential role of material efficiency and demand management strategies on material demand to be covered by the industry sector."

wg3_ch11_11.4.2.2_p22,NO_TITLE,"While sector-specific cost analyses  are rare in general, there are scenarios indicating that pathways to net zero CO2 emissions in the emissions-intensive sectors can be realised with limited additional costs. According to the Energy Transitions Commission (2018), deep decarbonisation from four major industry subsectors (plastics, steel, aluminium and cement) is achievable on a global level with cumulative incremental capital investments (2015–2050) limited to about 0.1% of aggregate GDP over that period. UKCCC (2019a) assesses that total incremental costs (compared to a theoretical scenario with no climate change policy action at all) for cutting industrial emissions by 90% by 2050 is 0.2% of expected 2050 UK GDP (UKCCC 2019a). The additional investment is 0.2% of gross fixed capital formation (Material Economics 2019). The IEA (2020a) indicates the required annual incremental global investment in heavy industry is approximately 40 billion 2019USD yr –1 moving from STEPS to the SDS scenario (2020–2040), rising to USD55 billion yr –1 (2040–2070), effectively 0.05–0.07% of global annual GDP today."

For cement, steel and primary chemicals GHG intensities are presented, and for all industry absolute GHG emissions are displayed. Effects of the following mitigation strategies are reflected: energy efficiency, material efficiency, circularity/recycling, feedstock carbon intensity, fuel switching, CCU and CCS.

This is widely recognised, for example, in the case of electrification of transport (Sections 6.6.2 and 10.3.1), but it has been less explored for industrial decarbonisation. Industry is a complex web of subsectors and intersectoral interaction and dependence, with associated mitigation opportunities and co-benefits and costs (OECD 2019b; Mendez-Alva et al. 2021). Implementation of the mitigation options assessed in Section 11.3 will result in new sectoral couplings, value chains, and business models but also in the phasing out of old ones. Notably, electrification in industry, hydrogen and sourcing of non-fossil carbon involves profound changes to how industry interacts with electricity systems and how industrial subsectors interact. For example, the chemicals and forestry industries will become much more coupled if various forms of biogenic carbon become an important feedstock for plastics (Figure 11.10). Clinker substitution with blast furnace slag in the cement industry is a well-established way of reducing CO2 emissions (Fechner and Kray 2012), but this slag will no longer be available if blast furnaces are phased out. Furthermore, additional material demand resulting from mitigation in other sectors, as well as adaptation and the importance of material efficiency improvements, are issues that have attracted increasing attention since AR5 (IEA 2019b; Bleischwitz 2020; Hertwich et al. 2020).

A European study shows that temporal heat demand flexibility could allow for up to 100% utilisation of excess heat from industry (Karner et al. 2018).

For future mitigation, the UKCCC (2019b) finds that industrial clustering may be essential for achieving the necessary efficiencies of scale and to build the infrastructure needed for industrial electrification; carbon capture, transport and disposal; hydrogen production and storage;  heat cascading between industries and to other potential heat users (e.g., residential and commercial buildings)."
wg3_ch11_11.4.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"With increasing shares of renewable electricity production there is a growing interest in industrial demand response, storage and hybrid solutions with on-site PV and combined heat and power (CHP) (Shoreh et al. 2016; Scheubel et al. 2017; Schriever and Halstrup 2018). With future industrial electrification, and in particular with hydrogen used as reduction agent in iron-making or as feedstock in the chemicals industry, the level of interaction between industry and power systems becomes very high. Large amounts of coking coal, or oil and gas as petrochemical energy and feedstock, are then replaced by electricity. For example, Meys et al. (2021) estimates a staggering future electricity demand of 10,000 TWh in a scenario for a net zero emissions plastics production of 1100 Mt in 2050 (see Section11.3.5 for other estimates of electricity demand). Much of this electricity is used to produce hydrogen to allow for CCU and this provides a very large potential flexible demand if electrolysers are combined with hydrogen storage. Vogl et al. (2018) describe how hydrogen DRI and EAF steel plants can be highly flexible in their electricity demand by storing hydrogen or hot-briquetted iron and increasing the share of scrap in EAF. The IEA (2019f) Future of Hydrogen report suggests that hydrogen production and storage networks could be in locations with already existing hydrogen production and storage, for example, chemical industries, and that these could be ideal for system load balancing and demand response, and in the case of district heating systems – for heat cascading."
wg3_ch11_11.4.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"The climate awareness that investors, shareholders, and customers demand from companies has been increasing steadily. It is reflected in the growing number of environmental management, carbon footprint accounting, benchmarking and reporting schemes (e.g., the Carbon Disclosure Project, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, Environmental Product Declarations, and others, e.g., Qian et al. 2018) requiring companies to disclose both direct and indirect GHG emissions, and creating explicit (for regulatory schemes) as well as implicit GHG liabilities. This requires harmonised and widely accepted methods for environmental and carbon footprint accounting (Bashmakov et al. 2021b). From an investor perspective there are both physical risks (e.g., potential damages from climate change to business) and transition risks (e.g., premature devaluation of assets driven by new policies and technologies deployment and changes in public and private consumer preferences (NGFS 2019a)). Accompanied by reputational risks this leads to increased attention to Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) principles and increased demands from investors, consumers and governments on climate and sustainability reporting and disclosure (NGFS 2019b). For example, Japan’s Keidanren promotes a scheme by different industries to reduce GHG through the global value chain, including material procurement, product-use stages, and disposal, regardless of geographical origin, with provided quantitative visualisation (Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) 2018). The EU adopted a non-financial disclosure directive in 2014 (Kinderman 2020) and a Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance in 2019 (Section 15.6.1)."

Many of the energy-intensive industries are located based on access to fresh water (e.g., pulp and paper) or sea transport (e.g., petrochemicals). Risks of major concern for industry include disrupted supply chains and energy supplies due to extreme weather events, as well as risks associated with droughts, floods with dirty water, sea level rise and storm surges (Dodman et al. 2021). Adaptation measures may in turn affect the demand for basic materials (e.g., steel and cement), for example, increased demand to build sea walls and protect infrastructure, but we have not found any estimates of the potential demand. Increased heat stress is unsafe for outdoor labourers and can reduce worker productivity, for example, in outdoor construction, resource extraction and waste handling (Ranasinghe et al. 2021)."

Some are already industrialised, while developing and emerging economies are on earlier take-off stages or accelerated growth stages and have yet to build the basic infrastructure needed to allow for basic mobility, housing, sanitation, and other services (Section11.2.3). The available in-use stock of material per capita and in each country therefore differs significantly, and transition pathways will require a different mix of strategies, depending on each country’s material demand to build, maintain, and operate stock of long-lived assets. Industrialised economies have much greater opportunities for reusing and recycling materials, while emerging economies have greater opportunities to avoid carbon lock-in. The IEA projected that more than 90% of the additional 2050 production of key materials will originate in non-OECD countries (IEA 2017). As incomes rise in emerging economies, the industry sector will grow in tandem to meet the increased demand for the manufactured goods and raw materials essential for infrastructure development. The energy and feedstocks needed to support this growth are likely to constitute a large portion of the increase in the emerging economies’ GHG emissions in the future unless new low-carbon pathways are identified and promoted."
wg3_ch11_11.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Emissions are typically categorised by the territory, subsector or group of technologies from which they emanate. An alternative subdivision is that between existing sources that will continue to generate emissions in the future, and those that are yet to be built (Erickson et al. 2015). The rate of emissions from existing assets will eventually tend to zero, but in a timeframe that is relevant to existing climate and energy goals, the cumulative contribution to emissions from existing infrastructure and equipment is likely to be substantial. Aside from the magnitude of the contribution, the distinction between emissions from existing and forthcoming assets is instructive because of the difference in approach to mitigation that may be necessary or desirable in each instance to avoid getting locked into decades of highly carbon-intensive operations (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014)."
wg3_ch11_11.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Details of the methodologies to assess ‘carbon lock-in’ or ‘committed emissions’ differ across studies but the core components of the approaches adopted are common to each: an account of the existing level of emissions for the scope being assessed is established; this level is projected forward with a stylised decay function that is informed by assessments of the current age and typical lifetimes of the underlying assets. From this, a cumulative emissions estimate is calculated. The future emissions intensity of the operated assets is usually assumed to remain constant, implying that nothing is done to retrofit with mitigating technologies (e.g., carbon capture) or alter the way in which the plant is operated (e.g., switching to an alternative fuel or feedstock). While the quantities of emissions derived are often referred to as ‘committed’ or ‘locked-in’, their occurrence is of course dependent on a suite of economic, technology and policy developments that are highly uncertain."
wg3_ch11_11.5.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Data on the current age profile and typical lifetimes of emissions-intensive industrial equipment are difficult to procure and verify and most of the studies conducted in this area contain little detail on the global industrial sector. Two recent studies are exceptions, both of which cover the global energy system, but contain detailed and novel analysis on the industrial sector (Tong et al. 2019; IEA 2020a). Tong et al. (2019) use unit-level data from China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment to obtain a more robust estimate of the age profile of existing capacity in the cement and iron and steel sectors in the country. The IEA (2020a) uses proprietary global capacity datasets for the iron and steel, cement and chemicals sectors, and historic energy consumption data for the remaining industry sectors as a proxy for the rate of historic capacity build-up."
wg3_ch11_11.5.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Both studies come to similar estimates on the average age of cement plants and blast furnaces in China of around 10–12 years old, which are the figures for which they have overlapping coverage. Both studies also use the same assumption of the typical lifetime of assets in these sectors of 40 years, whereas the IEA (2020a) study uses 30 years for chemical sector assets and 25 years for other industrial sectors. The studies come to differing estimates of cumulative emissions by 2050 from the industry sector; 196 GtCO2 in the IEA (2020a) study, and 162 GtCO2 in the Tong et al. (2019) study. This difference is attributable to a differing scope of emissions, with the IEA (2020a) study including industrial process emissions (which for the cement sector in particular are substantial) in addition to the energy-related emissions quantities accounted for in the Tong et al. (2019) study. After correcting for this difference in scope, the emissions estimates compare favourably."
wg3_ch11_11.5.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The IEA (2020a) study provides supplementary analysis for the industry sector, examining the impact of considering investment cycles alongside the typical lifetimes assumed in its core analysis of emissions from existing industrial assets. For three heavy industry sectors – iron and steel, cement, and chemicals – the decay function applied to emissions from existing assets is re-simulated using a 25-year investment cycle assumption (Figure 11.14). This is 15 years shorter than the typical lifetimes assumed for assets in the iron and steel and cement sectors, and five years shorter than that considered for the chemical sector. The shorter timeframe for the investment cycle is a simplified way of representing the intermediate investments that are made to extend the life of a plant, such as the re-lining of a blast furnace, which can occur multiple times during the lifetime of an installation. These investments can often be similar in magnitude to that of replacing the installation, and they represent key points for intervention to reduce emissions. The findings of this supplementary analysis are that around 40%, or 60 GtCO2, could be avoided by 2050 if near-zero emissions options are available to replace this capacity, or units are retired, retrofitted or refurbished in a way that significantly mitigates emissions (e.g., retrofitting carbon capture, or fuel or process switching to utilise bioenergy or low-carbon hydrogen)."

Broadly speaking, these papers argue that while high-emitting facilities may last for a long time, be difficult to shut down early, and are inherent to local boarder supply chains, individual major processes that are currently highly GHG intense, such as blast furnaces and basic oxygen smelters, could be retired and replaced during major retrofits on much shorter time cycles of 15 to 25 years."
wg3_ch11_11.5.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"The cost of retrofitting or retiring a plant before the end of its lifetime depends on plant-specific conditions as well as a range of economic, technology and policy developments. For industrial decarbonisation it may be a greater challenge to accelerate the development and deployment of zero-emission technologies and systems than to handle the economic costs of retiring existing assets before end of life. The ‘lock-in’ also goes beyond the lifetime of key process units, such as blast furnaces and crackers, since they are typically part of large integrated plants or clusters with industrial symbiosis, as well as infrastructures with feedstock storage, ports, and pipelines. Individual industrial plants are often just a small part of a complex network of many facilities in an industrial supply chain. In that sense, current assessments of ‘carbon lock-in’ rely on simplifications due to the high the complexity of industry."

In contrast, chemical clusters may consist of several organisations that are subsidiaries to large multinational corporations with headquarters across the world, that also compete in different markets. Even in the presence of a local vision for sustainability this makes it difficult to engage in formalised collaboration or get support from headquarters (Bauer and Fuenfschilling 2019)."

On the other side, mitigation options may face corresponding institutional barriers.

Industrial policy can be progressive and promote new developments or be protective to help infant or declining industries. It may also involve the phase-out of industries, including efforts to retrain workers and create new jobs. Industrial policy is not one policy intervention but rather the combined effects of many policy instruments that are coordinated towards an industrial goal. Industrial policies can be classified as being either vertical or horizontal depending on whether singular sectors or technologies are targeted (e.g., through R&D, tariffs and subsidies) or the whole economy (e.g., education, infrastructure, and general tax policies). The horizontal policies are not always thought of as industrial policy, although taking a broad view, including policy coordination and institution building, is important for industrial policy to be effective (see e.g., Andreoni and Chang 2019)."

One driver is the desire to retain industry or re-industrialise in regions within Europe and North America where industry has a long record of declining shares of GDP. The need for economic growth and poverty eradication is a key driver in developing countries. An important aspect is the need to meet the ‘dual challenge of creating wealth for a growing population while staying within planetary boundaries’ (Altenburg and Assman 2017). The need for industrial policy that supports environmental goals and green growth has been analysed by Rodrik (2014); Aiginger (2014); Warwick (2013); and Busch et al. (2018). Similar ideas are taken up in OECD reports on green growth (OECD 2011) and system innovation (OECD 2015). However, these approaches to green industrial policy and innovation tend to focus on opportunities for manufacturing industries to develop through new markets for cleaner technologies. They rarely include explicit attention to the necessity of zero emissions and the profound changes in production, use and recycling of basic materials that this entails. This may also involve the phase-out or repurposing of industries that currently rely on fossil fuels and feedstock."

For industry, there has been a long time focus on energy efficiency policies through voluntary and negotiated agreements, energy management and audit schemes, and various programmes targeting industry (Fischedick et al. 2014 a). Since AR5, interest in circular economy policies has increased and they have become more prevalent across regions and countries, including the EU, China, USA., Japan and Brazil (e.g., McDowall et al. 2017; Ranta et al. 2018; Geng et al. 2019). For electrification and CCUS, efforts are nascent and mainly focused on technology development and demonstrations. Policies for demand reduction and materials efficiency are still relatively unexplored (e.g., Pollitt et al. 2020 and IEA 2019b).

This is particularly true for the energy- and emissions-intensive industries where cost increases and lost competitiveness may lead to carbon leakage (i.e., that industry relocates to regions with less stringent climate policies). Heavy industries typically pay no or very low energy taxes and where carbon pricing exists (e.g., in the European Trading Scheme) they are sheltered through free allocation of emission permits and potentially compensated for resulting electricity price increases. For example, Okereke and McDaniels (2012) show how the European steel industry was successful in avoiding cost increases and how information asymmetry in the policy process was important for that purpose."

Mitigation actions therefore are to be considered through the prism of impacts on achieving other economic, social and environmental goals. Those impacts are classified as co-benefits when they are positive or as risk when they are negative. Co-benefits can serve as additional drivers, while risks can inhibit the deployment of available mitigation options. Actions taken to mitigate climate change have direct and indirect interactions with SDGs, both positive (synergies) or negative (trade-offs) (Fuso Nerini et al. 2019)."

Co-benefits form an important driver supporting the adoption of mitigation strategies, yet are commonly overlooked in policymaking. Karlsson et al.

The combination of the above will depend on specific sectoral market barriers, technology maturity, and local political and social acceptance (Hoppmann et al. 2013; Rogge and Reichardt 2016). Industrial decarbonisation policies need to be innovative and definitive about net zero CO2 emissions to trigger the level of investment needed for the profound changes in production, use and recycling of basic materials needed (Nilsson et al. 2021). Inclusive and transparent governance that assesses industry decarbonisation progress, monitors innovation and accountability, and provides regular recommendations for policy adjustments is also important for progressing (Mathy et al. 2016; Bataille 2020a)."

Material efficiency is also neglected in products design, architectural and civil engineering education, infrastructure and building codes, and urban planning (Section 5.6) (Braun et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2019). For example, the overuse of steel and concrete in construction is well documented but policies or strategies (e.g., design guidelines or regulation) for improving the situation are lacking (Dunant et al. 2018; Shanks et al. 2019). Various circular economy solutions are gaining interest from policymakers with examples such as regulations and economic incentives for repair and reuse, initiatives to reduce planned obsolescence, and setting targets for recycling. Barriers that policies need to address are often specific to the different material loops (e.g., copper contamination for steel and lack of technologies or poor economics for plastics)."
wg3_ch11_11.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"There is also a growing interest from policymakers in electrification and fuel switching but the focus has been mainly on innovation and on developing technical production-side solutions rather than on creating markets for enabling demand for low-carbon products, although the concept of green public procurement is gaining traction. The situation is similar for CCU and CCS. Low-carbon technologies adoption represents an additional cost to producers, and this must be handled through fiscal incentives like tax benefits, GHG pricing, green subsidies, regulation and permit procedures. For example, the 45Q tax credit provides some incentives to reduce investor risk for CCS and attract private investment in the USA (Ochu and Friedmann 2021)."

The section describes how the need to focus on long-term transitions rather than incremental changes can be managed through the planning and strategising of transition pathways; discusses the role of research, development, and innovation policy; highlights the need for enabling low-carbon demand and market creation; reflects on the necessity of establishing and maintaining a level of knowledge and capacity in the policy domain about the industrial transition challenge; and points to the critical importance of coherence across geographical and policy contexts.

wg3_ch11_11.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Internalising the cost of GHG emissions in consumer choices and producer investment decisions has been a major strategy promoted by economists and considered by policymakers to mitigate emissions cost-effectively and to incentivise low-GHG innovations in a purportedly technology neutral way (Stiglitz et al. 2017; Boyce 2018). In the absence of a coordinated effort, individual countries, regions and cities have implemented carbon-pricing schemes. As of 23 August 2021, 64 carbon schemes have been implemented or are scheduled by law for implementation, covering 22.5% of global GHG emissions (World Bank 2020), 35 of which are carbon taxes, primarily implemented on a national level and 29 of which are emissions trading schemes, spread across national and sub-national jurisdictions."
wg3_ch11_11.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Assessments of pricing mechanisms show generally that they lead to reduced emissions, even in sectors that receive free allocation such as industry (Martin et al. 2016; Haites et al. 2018; Narassimhan et al. 2018; Metcalf 2019; Bayer and Aklin 2020). However, questions remain as to whether these schemes can bring emissions down fast enough to reach the Paris Agreement goals (Boyce 2018; Tvinnereim and Mehling 2018; World Bank Group 2019). Most carbon prices are well below the levels needed to motivate investments in high-cost options that are needed to reach net zero emissions (Section 11.4.1.5). Among the 64 carbon-price schemes implemented worldwide today, only nine have carbon prices above USD40 (World Bank 2020). These are all based in Europe and include EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) (above USD40 since March 2021), Switzerland ETS, and seven countries with carbon taxes. Furthermore, emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries are typically allowed exemptions and receive provisions that shelter them from any significant cost increase in virtually all pricing schemes (Haites 2018). These provisions have been allocated due to concerns about loss of competitiveness and carbon leakage which result from relocation and increased imports from jurisdictions with no, or weak, GHG emission regulations (Branger and Quirion 2014a; Branger and Quirion 2014b; Jakob 2021a). Embodied emissions in international trade accounts for one quarter of global CO2 emissions in 2015 (Moran et al. 2018) and has increased significantly over the past few decades, representing a significant challenge to competitiveness related to climate policy. CBAM, or CBA are trade-based mechanisms designed to ‘equalise’ the carbon costs for domestic and foreign producers. They are increasingly being considered by policymakers to address carbon leakage and create a level playing field for products produced in jurisdiction with no, or lower, carbon price (Mehling et al. 2019; Markkanen et al. 2021). On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a CBAM that requires importers of aluminium, cement, iron and steel, electricity and fertiliser to buy certificates at the ETS price for the emissions embedded in the imported products (European Commission 2021; Mörsdorf 2021). CBAMs should be crafted very carefully, to meet technical and legal challenges (Jakob et al. 2014; Sakai and Barrett 2016; Rocchi et al. 2018; Cosbey et al. 2019; Joltreau and Sommerfeld 2019; Pyrka et al. 2020). Technical challenges arise because estimating the price adjustment requires reliable data on the GHG content of products imported as well as a clear understanding of the climate policy  implications from the countries of imports. Application of pricing tools in industry requires standardisation (benchmarking) of carbon-intensity assessments at products, installations, enterprises, countries, regions, and the global level. The limited number of existing benchmarking systems are not yet harmonised and thus not able to fulfill this function effectively. This limits the scope of products that can potentially be covered by CBAM-type policies (Bashmakov et al. 2021a)."
wg3_ch11_11.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,Legal challenges arise because CBAM can be perceived as a protectionist measure violating the principle of non-discrimination under the regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). However the absence of GHG prices can also been perceived as a subsidy for fossil fuel-based production (Stiglitz 2006; Al Khourdajie and Finus 2020; Kuusi et al. 2020). Another argument supporting CBAM implementation is the possibility to induce low-GHG investment in non-regulated regions (Cosbey et al. 2019).
wg3_ch11_11.6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Thus far, California is the only jurisdiction that has implemented CBA tariffs applied on electricity imports from neighbouring states and provides insights on how a CBA can work in practice by using ‘default’ GHG emissions intensity benchmarks (Fowlie et al. 2021). CBAM is an approach likely to be applied first to a few selected energy-intensive industries that are at risk of carbon leakage, as the EU is considering. The implementation of CBA needs to balance applicability versus fairness of treatment. An option recently proposed is an individual adjustment mechanism to give companies exporting to the EU the option to demonstrate their actual carbon intensity (Mehling and Ritz 2020). Any CBAMs will have to comply with multilaterally agreed rules under the WTO Agreements to be implemented."
wg3_ch11_11.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The adoption of CBAM by different countries may evolve into the formation of a climate club where countries would align on specific elements of climate regulation (e.g., primary iron or clinker intensity) to facilitate implementation and incentivise countries to join (Nordhaus 2015; Hagen and Schneider 2021; Tagliapietra and Wolff 2021a,b). However, not all countries have the same abilities to report, adapt and transition to low-carbon production. The implications of CBAMs on trade relationships should be considered to avoid country divide and separation from a common goal of global decarbonisation (Michaelowa et al. 2019; Kuusi et al. 2020; Banerjee 2021; Eicke et al. 2021; Bashmakov 2021). The globalisation of markets and the fragmentation of supply chains complicates the assignment of responsibility for GHG emissions mitigations related to trade (Jakob et al. 2021). Production-based carbon-price schemes minimise the incentives for downstream carbon abatement due to the imperfect pass through of carbon costs and therefore overlook demand-side solutions such as material efficiency (Skelton and Allwood 2017; Baker 2018). An alternative approach is to set the carbon pricing downstream on the consumption of carbon-intensive materials, whether they are imported or produced locally (Neuhoff et al. 2015, 2019; Munnings et al. 2019). However, implementation of consumption-based GHG pricing is also challenged by the need of product GHG traceability and enforcement transaction costs (Jakob et al. 2014; Munnings et al. 2019). Hybrid approaches are also considered (Neuhoff et al. 2015; Bataille et al. 2018a; Jakob et al. 2021). The efficacy of GHG prices to achieve major industry decarbonisation has been challenged by additional real world implementation problems, such as highly regionally fragmented GHG markets (Boyce 2018; Tvinnereim and Mehling 2018) and the difficult social acceptance of price increases (Bailey et al. 2012; Raymond 2019). The higher GHG prices likely needed to incentivise industry to adopt low-GHG solutions pose social equity issues and resistance (Grainger and Kolstad 2010; Bataille et al. 2018b; Hourcade et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2019b; Wang et al. 2019). GHG pricing is also associated with promoting mainly incremental low-cost options and not investments in radical technical change or the transformation of socio-technical systems (Grubb et al. 2014; Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018; Stiglitz 2019; Rosenbloom et al. 2020). Transparent and strategic management of cap-and-trade proceeds toward inclusive decarbonisation transition that support high abatement cost options can contribute toward easing these shortcomings (Carl and Fedor 2016; Raymond 2019). In California, Senate Bill 535 (De León, Statutes of 2012) require that at least a quarter of the proceeds go to projects that provide a benefit to disadvantaged communities (California Climate Investments 2020)."

However, many researchers recognise that complementary policies must be developed to set current production and consumption patterns toward a path consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement goals as cap-and-trade or carbon taxes are not enough (Schmalensee and Stavins 2017; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte 2017; Bataille et al. 2018b; Kirchner et al. 2019). In this broader policy context, proceeds from pricing schemes can be used to support the deployment of options with near-term abatement costs that are too high to be incentivised by the prevailing carbon price, but which show substantial cost-reduction potential with scale and learning, and to ensure a just transition (Wang and Lo 2021)."

Grillitsch et al. (2019b) working from the socio-technical transitions literature, focuses on the need for maintaining ‘directionality’ for innovation (e.g., towards net zero transformation), the capacity for iterative technological and policy ‘experimentation’ and learning, ‘demand articulation’ (e.g., engagement of material efficiency and high value circularity), and ‘policy coordination’ as four main framing challenges. Wesseling et al. (2017b) bridges from the socio-technical transitions literature to a world more recognisable by executives and engineers, composed of structural components that include actors (e.g., firms, trade associations, government, research organisations, consumers, etc.), institutions (e.g., legal structures, norms, values and formal policies or regulations), technologies (e.g., facilities, infrastructure) and system interactions."

Wesseling et al. (2017b) and (Bataille et al. 2018a) further add a step to conduct ongoing stakeholder engagements, including stakeholders with effective ‘veto’ power (i.e., firms, unions, government, communities, indigenous groups), to share and gather information, educate, debate, and build consensus for a robust, politically resilient policy package. This engagement of stakeholders can also bring on new supply chain collaborations and bridge the cost pass-through challenge (e.g., the Swedish HYBRIT steel project, or the ELYSIS consortium, with plans to bring fully commercialised inert electrodes for bauxite electrolysis to market by 2024)."

Emission-intensive industries are characterised by large dominant actors and mature process technologies with high fixed cost, long payback times and low profit margins on the primary production side of the value chain.

As a result, jurisdictions are increasingly considering new requirements in building codes to reduce embodied emissions. This is the case of France’s new building code which is shifting from a thermal regulation (RT 2012) to an environmental regulation (RE 2020) to include embodied GHG LCA metrics for encouraging use of low-GHG building materials (Ministère de la Transition écologique et solidaire 2018; Schwarz et al. 2020).

Low-GHG building rating systems, such as LEEDs, are voluntary standards which include specific requirements on material resources in their rating scale. Trade-offs between energy performance achievement and material used in building construction needs to be further assessed and considered as low-GHG building code requirements develop. Local governments can also lead the way by adopting standards for construction.

wg3_ch11_11.6.4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Fossil-free basic materials production will often lead to higher costs of production, for example, 20–40% more for steel, 70–115% more for cement, and potentially 15–60% for chemicals (Material Economics 2019). There is a nascent literature on what are effectively material ‘feed-in-tariffs’ to bridge the commercialisation ‘valley of death’ (Wilson and Grubler 2011) of early development of low-GHG materials (Bataille et al. 2018a; Neuhoff et al. 2018; Sartor and Bataille 2019; Wyns et al. 2019). Renewable electricity support schemes have typically been price-based (e.g., production subsidies and feed-in-tariffs) or volume-based (e.g., quota obligations and certificate schemes) and both principles can be applied when thinking about low-GHG materials. Auction schemes are typically used for larger-scale projects, for example, offshore wind parks."
wg3_ch11_11.6.4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Based on how feed-in-tariffs worked, a contract for difference (CfD) could guarantee a minimum and higher-than-market price for a given volume of early low-GHG materials. CfDs could be based on a minimum effective GHG price reflecting parity with the costs of current higher-emitting technologies, or directly on the higher base capital and operating costs for a lower-GHG material (Richstein 2017; Chiappinelli et al. 2019; Sartor and Bataille 2019; Vogl et al. 2021a). CfDs can also be offered through low-GHG material procurement where an agreed price offsets the incremental cost of buying low-GHG content product or material. Private firms, by themselves or collectively, can also guarantee a higher than market price for low-GHG materials from their supplier for marketing purposes (Bataille et al. 2018a; Bataille 2020a). Reverse auctions (by which the lowest bidder gets the production subsidy) for low-GHG materials is also an option but it remains to be analysed and explored. While these financial incentive schemes have been implemented for renewable energy, their application to incentivise and support low-GHG material production have yet to be developed and implemented. The German government is currently developing a draft law which will allow companies that commit to cut GHG emissions by more than half using innovative technologies to bid for 10-year CfDs with a guaranteed price for low-carbon steel, chemical and cement products (Agora Energiewende and Wuppertal Institut 2019; BMU 2021)."

This is the case of aluminium for which quantity of low-GHG production already exist in countries where hydroelectric power is a common power source. Market developments will allow for low-GHG aluminium to trade at a premium rate as demand develops. For example, Harbor Aluminium has launched a green aluminium spot premium at the end of October 2019 and the London Metal Exchange has introduced a ‘green aluminium’ spot exchange contract. (LME 2020; Das 2021)."
wg3_ch11_11.6.4.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Extended producer responsibility (EPR) systems are increasingly used by policymakers to require producers to take responsibility for the end life of their outputs and to cover the cost of recycling of materials or otherwise responsibly managing problematic wastes (Kaza et al. 2018). According to the OECD, there are about 400 EPR systems in operation worldwide, three quarters of which have been established over the last two decades. One third of EPR systems cover small consumer electronic equipment, followed by packaging and tyres (each 17%), vehicles, lead-acid batteries and a range of other products (OECD 2016)."
wg3_ch11_11.6.4.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"While the economic value of some discarded materials such as steel, paper and aluminium is generally high enough to justify the cost and efforts of recycling, at current rates of 85%, above 60%, and 43%, respectively (Graedel et al. 2011; Cullen and Allwood 2013), others like plastic or concrete have a much lower re-circularity value (Graedel et al. 2011). Most plastic waste ends up in landfills or dumped in the environment, with 9% recycled and 12% incinerated globally (Geyer et al. 2017; UNEP 2018). Collected waste plastics from OECD countries were largely exported to China until a ban in 2018 required OECD countries to review their practices (Qu et al. 2019). EPR schemes may thus need to be strengthened to actually achieve a reduced use of virgin GHG-intensive materials. The potential for re-circularity of unreacted cement and aggregates in concrete is increasing as new standards and requirement develops. For example, concrete fines are now standardised as a new cement constituent in the European standardisation CEN/TC 51 – ‘cements and construction limes’."
wg3_ch11_11.6.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"It is important that government bodies, academia and other actors strengthen their knowledge and capacities for the broad transformational changes envisioned for industry. In Japan, industry has been voluntarily working on GHG reduction, under the Framework of Keidanren’s Commitment to a Low-carbon Society since 2009. Government and scientific experts regularly review their commitments and discuss results, monitoring methods, and reconsidering goals. Industry federations/associations can obtain advice in the follow-up meetings from other industries and academics. The energy and transport sectors have decades of building institutions and expertise, whereas industrial decarbonisation is largely a new policy domain. Most countries have experience in energy efficiency policies, some areas of research and innovation, waste management, regulations for operational permits and pollution control, worker safety and perhaps fuel switching. There is less experience with market demand pull policies although low-GHG public procurement is increasingly being tested. Circular economy policies are evolving but potential policies for managing material demand growth are less understood. Material efficiency policies through, for example, product standards or regulation against planned obsolescence are nascent but relatively unexplored (Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018a)."
wg3_ch11_11.6.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"All this argues for active co-oversight, management and assessment by government, firms, sector associations and other actors, in effect the formation of an active industrial policy that includes decarbonisation in its broader mandate of economic and social development (OECD 2019b; Bataille 2020a). This could draw from the quadruple helix innovation model, which considers the role of government, universities, the private sector, the natural environment and social systems to foster collaboration in innovation (Carayannis and Campbell 2019; Durán-Romero et al. 2020). Important aspects of governance include mechanisms for monitoring, transparency, and accountability. It may involve the development of new evaluation approaches, including a greater focus on ex ante evaluations and assessment of, for example, readiness and capacities, rather than ex post  evaluations of outcomes. Such organisational routines for learning have been identified as a key aspect of policy capacity to govern evolutionary processes (Karo and Kattel 2018; Kattel and Mazzucato 2018). Although many governments have adopted ideas of focusing resources on the mission or challenge of climate change mitigation, comparisons between Western and East Asian contexts show significant differences in the implementation of governance structures (Karo 2018; Mazzucato et al. 2020; Wanzenböck et al. 2020). Overall, improved knowledge and stronger expertise is important also to handle information asymmetries and the risk of regulatory capture."

wg3_ch11_11.6.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Although there is little evidence of carbon leakage so far it will be ever more important to strive for coherence in climate and trade policies as some countries take the lead in decarbonising internationally traded basic materials (Jakob 2021b). At the time of writing the previously academic debate on this issue is shifting to real policymaking through debates and negotiations around carbon border adjustment (Section 11.6.1) and sectoral agreements or climate clubs (Nordhaus 2015; Åhman et al. 2017; Jakob 2021a; Nilsson et al. 2021). The climate and trade policy integration should also consider what is sometimes called positive leakage, that is that heavy industry production moves to where it is easier to reach zero emissions. As a result, policy should go beyond border measures to include, for example, international technology cooperation and transfer and development of shared lead markets."

This indicates large changes in industrial and supply chain structure, with directly associated needs for employment and skills. Some sectors will grow, and some will shrink, with differing skill needs. Each new workforce cohort needs the general specific skill to provide the employment that is needed at each stage in the transition, implicating a need for coordination with policies for education and retraining."

The UKCCC Net Zero Technical Report describes the infrastructure needs for achieving net zero GHG in the UK by 2050 for every sector of the economy (UKCCC 2019b). Transportation would be facilitated with pipelines or ships to allow transfer of captured CO2 for utilisation and disposal, and associated institutional frameworks (IEAGHG 2021). Electrification will require market design and transmission to support increased generation, transmission, and flexible demand. Hydrogen, CCU, and CCS will require significant new or adapted infrastructure. Hydrogen and CO2 pipelines, and expanded electricity transmission, have natural monopoly characteristics which are normally governed and planned by national and regional grid operators and their regulators. Industrial clustering (also known as eco-parks), such as those planned in Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Teeside (UK), would allow more physical and cost-effective sharing of electricity, CCU, CCS, and hydrogen infrastructure but is dependent on physical planning, permitting, and infrastructure policies."

Competition is strong, investments are rare, capital intensive and very ‘lumpy’. In an atmosphere where transformative innovation is required the process is very capital-focused with non-diversifiable risks unless several companies are involved. There are significant infrastructure needs for electricity, hydrogen, and CCS and CCU. Given there is no ‘natural’ market for low-emissions materials, there is a need to manage both the supply and demand sides of the market, especially in early phase through lead supplier and markets. Finally, there is a very high probability of surprises and substantial learning, which could affect policy choice, direction, and stringency."

wg3_ch11_FAQ 11.1 | 	What are the key options to reduce industrial emissions?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Industry has a diverse set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources across subsectors. To decarbonise industry requires that we pursue several options simultaneously. These include energy efficiency, materials demand management, improving materials efficiency, more circular material flows, electrification, as well as carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Improved materials efficiency and recycling reduces the need for primary resource extraction and the energy-intensive primary processing steps. Future recycling may include chemical recycling of plastics if quality requirements make mechanical recycling difficult. One approach, albeit energy intensive, is to break down waste plastics to produce new monomer building blocks, potentially based on biogenic carbon and hydrogen instead of fossil feedstock. Hydrogen can also be used as a reduction agent instead of coke and coal in ironmaking. Process emissions from cement production can be captured and stored or used as feedstock for chemicals and materials. Electricity and hydrogen needs can be very large but the potential for renewable electricity, possibly in combination with other low carbon options, is not a limiting factor."
wg3_ch11_FAQ 11.2 | 	How costly is industrial decarbonisation and will there be synergies _p1,NO_TITLE,"In most cases and in early stages of deployment, decarbonisation through electrification or CCS will make the primary production of basic materials such as cement, steel, or polyethylene more expensive. However, demand management, energy and materials efficiency, and more circular material flows can dampen the effect of such cost increases. In addition, the cost of energy-intensive materials is typically a very small part of the total price of products, such as an appliance, a bottle of soda or a building, so the effect on consumers is very small. Getting actors to pay more for zero-emission materials is a challenge in supply chains with a strong focus on competitiveness and cutting costs, but it is not a significant problem for the broader economy. Reduced demand for services such as square metres of living space or kilometres of car travel is an option where material living standards are already high. If material living standards are very low, increased material use is often needed for more sustainable development. The options of materials and energy efficiency, and more circular material flows, generally have synergies with sustainable development. Increased use of electricity, hydrogen, CCU and CCS may have both positive and negative implications for sustainable development and thus require careful assessment and implementation for different contexts."
wg3_ch11_FAQ 11.3 |	What needs to happen for a low-carbon industry transition?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Broad and sequential policy strategies for industrial development and decarbonisation that pursue several mitigation options at the same time are more likely to result in resource-efficient and cost-effective emission reductions. Industrial decarbonisation is a relatively new field and thus building capacity for industrial transition governance is motivated. For example, policy to support materials efficiency or fundamental technology shifts in primary processes is less developed than energy efficiency policy and carbon pricing. Based on shared visions or pathways for a zero-emission industry, industrial policy needs to support development of new technologies and solutions as well as market creation for low- and zero-emission materials and products. This implies coordination across several policy domains including research and innovation, waste and recycling, product standards, digitalisation, taxes, regional development, infrastructure, public procurement, permit procedures and more to make the transition to a carbon neutral industry. International competition means that trade rules must be evolved to not conflict with industrial decarbonisation. Some local and regional economies may be disadvantaged from the transition which can motivate re-education and other support."
