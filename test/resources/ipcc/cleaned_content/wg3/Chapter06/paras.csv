Energy will be provided, converted, and used in different ways than it is today (Figure 6.1). Achieving and responding to these changes presents an impressive range of challenges and opportunities."
wg3_ch06_6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Within this context, this chapter has two main objectives. First, it aims to assess specific, individual mitigation options in energy supply, energy transformation, and energy transportation and transmission. This assessment is complementary to a set of chapters that explore mitigation options in agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (Chapter 7), urban systems and other settlements (Chapter 8), buildings (Chapter 9), transport (Chapter 10), industry (Chapter 11), and cross-sectoral perspectives (Chapter 12). Second, this chapter aims to assess system-level mitigation opportunities and challenges across the entirety of energy systems. These systems include energy supply, transformation, transmission, storage, transportation, and end uses. They also include the societal systems that interact with the physical energy system. As energy systems become increasingly integrated and interconnected, a system-wide perspective is necessary for understanding mitigation opportunities and challenges."
wg3_ch06_6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Within this context, this chapter addresses six topics, each of which is addressed in a separate section. First, Section 6.2 defines the scope of the energy system. Section 6.3 then discusses the recent trends in energy systems that might exert the most significant influence on energy system evolution and options for reducing emissions. Section 6.4 assesses the status and potential of individual energy supply, transformation, storage, transportation and transmission, and integration mitigation options in the energy sector. Section 6.5 explores how climate change might affect energy systems and alter potential energy system mitigation options and strategies. Section 6.6 identifies key characteristics of net-zero energy systems – those that emit very little or no CO2. Section 6.7 explores transition pathways toward and through net-zero energy systems. Across all of these sections, the chapter aims to explore the ways that energy sector mitigation options and strategies interact with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other societal and environmental goals."
wg3_ch06_6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"For this chapter, energy systems are defined broadly to include both physical and societal elements. The physical infrastructure includes all the infrastructure and equipment used to extract, transform, transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use energy. Consumers can invest in equipment that reduces their energy needs, and they can invest in technologies that transform energy (e.g., rooftop solar) or store energy (e.g., batteries). Firms and governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy such as power plants, refineries, electric transmission lines, and oil tankers. All aspects of energy systems are governed by laws, regulations, and actual institutions that reside within businesses and governments at all levels. This includes, for example, rules for trading emissions permits, deciding when particular electricity generation technologies might come online, water management and related environmental rules that define the availability of hydropower or influence water availability for cooling power plants, regulations for injecting CO2 into underground reservoirs or disposing of nuclear waste, and even company policies regarding work hours or teleworking, which can have important implications for energy demand profiles. Many people are employed in the energy sector, and energy system mitigation will eliminate some jobs while creating others."
wg3_ch06_6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"This broader view of energy systems is essential for understanding energy system mitigation, as these broader societal and institutional factors can have an important influence on energy system transformations and the potential to rapidly reduce energy CO2 emissions. Energy system mitigation is as much about the challenges of societal change as it is about the challenges of changes in physical infrastructure, technologies, and operations. While this chapter does not attempt to draw a specific boundary around all the different systems that interact with the energy system, it frequently explores these broader system interactions when assessing different mitigation options and strategies."
wg3_ch06_6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is no single spatial scale at which energy systems might be defined and assessed. They can be assessed at the scales of homes, cities, states or provinces, countries, regions, or the entire world. These different scales are frequently both distinct with their own internal dynamics yet al.o connected to one another. This chapter most frequently assesses energy systems from the country and global perspective."
wg3_ch06_6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Because the energy system is so complex, it can be hard to define particular parts of it precisely, and there may be competing definitions in the literature. For the purposes of this chapter, ‘energy supply‘ encompasses all primary energy, conversion, and transmission processes with the exception of those that use final energy to provide energy services in the end-use sectors (transport, buildings, industry and agriculture). The ‘energy system‘ includes energy end uses sectors along with energy supply. ‘Low-emissions‘ is used for energy technologies that produce little CO2 or no CO2 or that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Similarly, ‘low-carbon‘ transitions is used to describe transitions that limit likely to 2°C (>67%) or below. ‘Net-zero‘ energy systems refer to those that produce very little or no CO2 or may even sequester CO2 from the atmosphere."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Current energy sector emissions trends, if continued, will not limit global temperature change to well below 2°C ( high confidence). Global energy system fossil fuel CO2 emissions grew by 4.6% between 2015 and 2019 (1.1% yr –1), reaching 38 GtCO2 yr –1 and accounting for approximately two-thirds of annual global anthropogenic GHG emissions. In 2020, with the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, energy sector CO2 emissions dropped by roughly 2 GtCO2 yr –1 (Figure 6.2). However global energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to rebound by nearly 5% in 2021, approaching the 2018–19 peak (IEA 2021d)."

Oil accounted for about 34% and natural gas accounted for about 22% of energy sector CO2 emissions. Coal, oil and natural gas CO2 emissions grew respectively by 1.2%, 2% and 12.7% (annual rates of 0.31%, 0.5% and 3%) (Figure 6.3). The electricity sector remains the single largest source of energy sector CO2 emissions, accounting for about 36% in 2019, followed by industry at 22% and transport (excluding international shipping and aviation transport) at about 18% (Figure 6.3). Shipping and aviation accounted for a little over 3%. These proportions have remained relatively unchanged over the last decade. Recent trends reinforce the near-term challenges facing energy sector mitigation – electricity sector emissions continue to rise despite rapid deployment of wind and solar power (see below); transportation emissions continue to rise, and petroleum remains the dominant fuel, despite advances in batteries and electric cars (see below). Some specific sectors, such as shipping and aviation, may present longer-term challenges."

Approximately 18% of energy supply emissions were non-CO2 emissions. Electricity and heat contributed approximately 69% of total energy supply GHG emissions in 2019 (Figure 6.3). This growth has occurred despite the high penetration of solar PV and wind power, particularly in Asia and developed countries."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Fugitive emissions from fossil fuel production, primarily methane, accounted for about 18% of sector supply emissions in 2019, with 2.6 Gt CO2-eq yr –1 linked to oil and gas production and 1.3 GtCO2-eq yr –1 to coal mining (Crippa et al. 2021). Oil and gas operations produced 2.9 GtCO2- eq yr –1 in 2019 (82 Mt yr –1 as methane), split roughly equally between the two (IEA 2020a). There remains a high degree of uncertainty in methane emissions estimates from oil and gas operations despite the emergence of new data from satellites and other measurement campaigns. According to a recent study (Hmiel et al. 2020), methane emissions are underestimated by about 25 to 40%. "
wg3_ch06_6.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Increasing global energy sector GHG emissions have been driven by rising emissions in some large developing and emerging countries; however, per capita emissions in these countries remain well below those in developed countries (Yu et al. 2019). From 2015 to 2019, Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and South-East Asia energy sector CO2 emissions grew by 2.4% yr –1, 2.6% yr –1, and 5.1% yr –1, respectively. The relative and absolute shares of Europe and North America have continued to decline, partly due to the growth in other countries (Figure 6.3)."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Despite the declining energy intensity, global energy system CO2 emissions have closely tracked GDP per capita (Figure 6.4). This is especially true in the Asian economies, which have experienced rapid GDP per capita growth in the past decades and a massive rise in energy demand. Similarly, emissions have declined in times of economic downturns – for example, in Eurasia in the 1990s and globally in 2009 and 2020. Population growth has also contributed to emissions growth globally and in most regions, particularly Africa, but the effect of population growth has been less than that of economic growth. Since 2015, energy intensity has been declining (IEA 2020b), limiting the impact of economic and population growth. However, there is no region where this factor alone would have been sufficient to decrease CO2 emissions from the energy system. In Europe and North America, the only two regions where emissions decreased meaningfully since 2010, a steady decrease in the carbon intensity of energy was a significant downward driver. The reduction in carbon intensity in the EU is due primarily to the increase of renewable electricity production coupled with the low levels of fossil fuel-based production in the energy mix (Dyrstad et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"Recent changes in the energy system can be viewed within the context of longer-term trends in energy supply and use. Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the total primary energy supply (TPES) and major changes in energy sources. From 2015 to 2019, TPES grew by 6.6% (1.6% yr –1) from 569 EJ yr –1 to 606 EJ yr –1. Natural gas consumption grew most quickly during this period, at 3.5% yr –1. Coal, oil and oil products grew at annual rates of 0.23% yr –1 and 0.83% yr –1, respectively. In 2019, the shares of coal, oil, and natural gas in global TPES were 27%, 31% and 23%, representing only a modest shift from 2015, when the shares were 28%, 32% and 22%, respectively. Renewables, excluding hydropower, grew at an annual rate of 12% yr –1 during this period; however, their share remains marginal in 2019, with just 2.2% of the TPES compared to 1.5% in 2015 (Figure 6.5). Bioenergy (including traditional bioenergy) accounted for 9.4% of the TPES, a similar share compared with 2015."

This is a slower growth rate than the previous decade (2.8% yr –1) (Figure 6.5). In 2019, oil products used for transportation accounted for 41% of TFC. The penetration of non-fossil fuels is still marginal despite the significant growth of electric vehicles in recent years. Coal still accounted for 9.5% of TFC in 2019, dropping from 11.7% in 2015. Coal is mainly used as a primary energy source in industry and, to a lesser extent, in the residential sector. The share of electricity increased modestly, from 18.6% in 2015 to 20.2% in 2019, reflecting increasing access in developing countries and increasing use of electricity for a wide variety of end uses in the residential sector (Box 6.1). Heat accounts for approximately 3% of TFC, used mainly in industry and the residential sector. Biofuels and waste accounted for 10.4% of TFC in 2019, only modestly changed compared with 2015."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p15,NO_TITLE,"There are important differences in fuel use across countries. While developed countries almost exclusively use modern fuels, many countries still obtain a significant fraction of their energy from traditional bioenergy (fuelwood and charcoal). Traditional bioenergy (fuelwood and charcoal) is particularly important in sub-Saharan countries and some Asian countries such as India, particularly in the residential sector for cooking. Africa is still characterised by a high share of traditional bioenergy in TPES and TFC. In 2019, biomass and waste in Africa accounted for 44% of the TPES. The global average was 9.4%."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p16,NO_TITLE,"Asia has been particularly important in TFC growth since 2015. In 2019, Eastern Asia accounted for more 24% of TFC (1.52% annual growth from 2015). In contrast, TFC has increased by only 0.58% in Europe and 1.24% in North America. Despite an increase of 2.05% over the same period, Africa’s TFC remains relatively low (6.1% of global TFC), particularly in sub-Saharan countries. Approximately 860 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and some Asian countries, lacked access to electricity and about 2.65 billion to clean-cooking facilities in 2018 (IEA 2019a). Achieving universal energy access (SDG 7) will require energy transitions in the domestic sector, including new developments in off-grid energy technologies, emphasis on rationalising energy subsidies, and increasing efforts to address health concerns related to the use of traditional fuels (Box 6.1)."

Although most of those people gaining access to energy have gained access to fossil fuel-based electricity, an increasing number are gaining access to electricity from renewable sources. Low-emissions, decentralised systems are proving a cost-effective way to provide electricity in rural areas (Scott et al. 2016; Muchunku et al. 2018; IEA 2019b), although the use of diesel generators continues in some remote areas. Between 2000 and 2019 the proportion of the population with access to clean cooking (modern fuels and/or improved biomass cookstoves) rose from 52% to 66%."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p20,NO_TITLE,"Energy security. The ability of countries to maintain access to reliable and affordable energy resources continues to shape energy policy. Energy security is perceived as a national security issue and often prioritised over climate concerns (Nyman 2018). The linkage between climate and energy security is now widely recognised (Blarke and Lund 2007; Toke and Vezirgiannidou 2013; La Viña et al. 2018; World Energy Council 2020; Fu et al. 2021; United Nations 2021). Approaches to energy security are frequently driven by the scope of domestic energy resources. For example, energy security concerns have led to continued reliance on domestic coal production and consumption (Jakob et al. 2020) and increased investment in domestic renewable generation (Konstantinos and Ioannidis 2017). Liquefied natural gas (LNG) Importers have diversified their sources as reliance on LNG has increased (Vivoda 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.3_p21,NO_TITLE,"Air pollution. The energy system is an important source of air pollution, including both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Efforts to address air pollution in several countries and regions (the USA, Mexico, China, India, European Union, Africa, Southeast Asia, among others) have had an importance influence on energy system changes (Bollen and Brink 2014; Fang et al. 2019). Policies aimed at controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions have driven emissions abatement efforts and coal fleet retirements (Singh and Rao 2015; Drake and York, 2021). In some places, the prospect of reducing local air pollution remains more salient to policymakers and the public than climate mitigation when deciding to tighten regulations on coal use (Brauers and Oei 2020)."

Costs for renewable technologies have fallen significantly in recent years, driving significant changes in electricity production and transportation (see below). These advances are not divorced from climate and other environmental concerns (Kuik, Branger and Quirion 2019; Timilsina and Shah 2020). Recent advances in PV cells, for example, can be traced in part to aggressive deployment policies spurred by energy security, climate, and other environmental concerns (Kreuz and Müsgens 2017) (Sections 6.3.5 and 6.4.2). The falling costs of batteries, manly Li-ion batteries, has boosted the competitiveness of electric vehicles (Nykvist et al. 2015) (Section 6.3.7)."

This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa and several Asian countries. SDG 7 on universal access to modern energy includes targets on modern energy services, renewable energy, and energy efficiency, which implies a profound transformation of the current energy systems. Although there are different definitions of energy access, the ultimate goal is universal access to clean and modern fuels."

About 2.65 billion households were cooking with solid fuels, distributed across Asia and Africa (IEA et al. 2020). Around 850 million people in sub-Saharan Africa relied on traditional biomass (firewood and charcoal) for cooking, and 60 million relied on kerosene and coal to meet their energy needs (IEA 2018a). Air pollution was likely responsible for 1.1 million deaths across Africa in 2019 (Fisher et al. 2021). It has been estimated that 2.2 billion people will still be dependent on inefficient and polluting energy sources for cooking by 2030, mainly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, and 650 million people are likely to remain without access to electricity in 2030, 90% of whom will reside in Sub-Saharan Africa (IEA et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch06_box-6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Research indicates that decentralised and on-grid renewables are likely the least cost options to provide universal access to electricity by 2030 (Section 6.4.2). Natural gas, LPG, and improved biomass cookstoves are the most important options for cooking.

Trends in the electricity sector, where most coal is being consumed, are similar. Growth in coal-fired electricity generation capacity in the Asia Pacific region has offset retirements in North America and Europe (Jakob et al. 2020; Global Energy Monitor et al., 2021)."

Older coal-fired power plants that cannot meet new environmental regulations, or have become unprofitable or uncompetitive, have been closed in many regions.

However, coal faces increasing business risks from the decreasing costs of alternative, low-emissions energy sources and increasing focus on air pollution and other environmental impacts from coal mining and use (Garg et al. 2017; Sovacool et al. 2021). Continued coal builds, mostly in developing countries, will increase the risks of stranded assets (Farfan Orozco 2017; Cui et al. 2019; Saygin et al. 2019) (Box 6.13)."

Moreover, even with a net increase in total employment, in the long run, renewable jobs are often located outside of coal regions and require different skill sets from the coal industry (Spencer et al. 2018). In a broader sense, achieving a ‘just transition’ also requires managing the impacts on regional economic development for coal-dependent communities and the effects of higher energy prices for consumers and energy-intensive industries through a comprehensive policy package (Green and Gambhir 2020; Jakob et al. 2020) (Box 6.2)."

To limit warming to 2°C or lower, and without new builds, existing coal plants will need to retire 10 to 25 years earlier than the historical average operating lifetime. Completing all planned projects will further reduce the viable lifetime of all plants by 5 to 10 years if warming is to be limited to 2°C or lower (Cui et al. 2019). Phasing-out coal in the next few decades will present economic, social, and security challenges. These will vary across regions based on the characteristics of existing coal infrastructure, the availability of alternatives, economic development, and technological and institutional lock-in (Jakob et al. 2020)."

Although these initial efforts are not yet sufficient in limiting warming to 1.5°C, and most have occurred in regions with older coal fleets, these examples provide insight into possible coal phase-out strategies (Spencer et al. 2018) and help identify the mechanisms driving the move away from coal, such as market, technology, policy, or other societal objectives. They also enable better understanding of the possible character of oil and gas phase-downs that would ultimately be needed to limit warming two well below 2°C (Section 6.7.4) (Raimi et al. 2019)."

The effectiveness of PPCA in countries with younger coal fleets has thus been questioned (Jewell et al. 2019; Blondeel et al. 2020). Germany recently joined the PPCA and has committed to phase out unabated coal by 2038. As part of its commitment to phase out coal, Germany is implementing a set of measures that include compensation for power plant closures, labour market measures for coal workers, and substantial support of structural change in coal-mining regions. Poland, another coal-heavy country in Europe, has not indicated a coal phase-out target and faces substantial challenges (Whitley et al. 2017; Antosiewicz et al. 2020). European efforts to phase out coal indicate that appropriate financial instruments are needed (Rentier et al. 2019), and a just transition for workers are important to gain broad public support and help those most affected by the phase-out (Johnstone and Hielscher 2017; Osička et al. 2020)."

The recently announced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by the Biden Administration sets a 100% carbon-free electricity goal by 2035 (The White House 2021), indicating a phase-out not only of unabated coal electricity generation, but also of natural gas generation. As one of the two founding countries of the PPCA, Canada has committed to phasing out unabated coal power by 2030 (Government of Canada 2018). Declining coal use in both the USA and Canada has decreased GHG emissions, local air pollutants, and cooling water use (Harris et al. 2015; Kondash et al. 2019). However, there have been concerns about social and economic consequences, particularly at the local level. For instance, the USA has lost about 50,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2021 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021), with significant regional and economic inequities (Bodenhamer 2016; Abraham 2017; Greenberg 2018).

Both China and India have suspended and cancelled many new coal power projects and retired a small set of old, dirty, inefficient coal plants (CEA 2019; Global Energy Monitor et al. 2021). These efforts are largely due to non-climate reasons, such air pollution and health (Singh and Rao 2015; Gass et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2018; Malik et al. 2020), overcapacity (Blondeel and Van de Graaf 2018), and rural electrification and renewable investments (Aklin et al. 2017; Thapar et al. 2018). However, as new builds offset retirements, coal generation capacity has continued to grow in both countries since 2015 (Global Energy Monitor et al. 2021). Other fast-growing Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines have experienced strong growth in coal use (IEA 2020b), but an increasing number of new coal power projects are being cancelled (Littlecott et al. 2021).

In recent years, regulatory instruments to promote low-carbon infrastructure have gained traction in developing countries (Finon 2019). The choice of policies has depended on institutional capacities, technological maturity and other developmental priorities of governments. For example, governments have favoured regulatory instruments over economic instruments when there has been sufficient institutional capacity to implement and monitor the regulations and standards (Hughes and Urpelainen 2015). Furthermore, institutional capacity has also determined the extent of implemented measures (Adenle et al. 2017). Market conditions and technological maturity are other important determinants of policy mixes being deployed in the energy sector.

Subsidies and carbon pricing have also played an important role in mainstreaming these renewable energy sources (Best and Burke 2018). Recently, subsidy-free investments in renewables, such as wind offshore (Jansen et al. 2020), backed by power purchase agreements, have gained momentum (Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2020).

Different measures have been suggested to improve the performance of the ETS, such as ‘price floors and caps’ and other carbon pricing schemes (Campiglio 2016; Bataille et al. 2018; Goulder and Morgenstern 2018). In 2020, 61 regional, national and sub-national carbon pricing instruments, representing 22% of the global GHG emissions, were in action or scheduled for implementation (World Bank 2019). Over 51% of emissions covered are priced at less than USD10 per tCO2-eq. At present, however, only 5% of the global emissions covered under carbon pricing initiatives are consistent with the range of carbon prices that have been suggested as needed to limit warming to well below 2°C (Stiglitz and Stern 2017). Most of the carbon pricing schemes have taken place in the OECD countries. The limited application of carbon pricing instruments in developing, and emerging economies may be due to political economy constraints (Campiglio 2016; Finon 2019). Carbon pricing had a sizeable impact on emissions – for example, the EU ETS impacts emissions from electricity in Germany (Schäfer 2019) and manufacturing in France (Colmer et al. 2020), respectively.

However, differences in the stringency of climate regulation have triggered fear that regulation reduces the competitiveness of industries in regulated countries and leads to industry relocation and ‘carbon leakage‘ (Schenker et al. 2018). In recent years, however, there is little evidence of carbon leakage (Naegele and Zaklan 2019; Schäfer 2019), and even positive effects of carbon pricing on efficiency have been observed (e.g., Löschel et al. 2019, for German manufacturing firms, and Germeshausen 2020 for German power plants). However, with asymmetric rising carbon prices, discussions about specific policy mechanisms to address carbon leakage like carbon border adjustments (Cosbey et al. 2019) were amplified. Furthermore, multiple policies – often implemented by different governmental levels (national vs sub-national) – interacted with each other and thereby affected their environmental and economic effectiveness. Recent examples include interactions of ETS with renewable support policies (e.g. Boehringer and Behrens 2015; Del Rio 2017), energy efficiency policies (e.g. Wiese et al. 2018) or electricity market reform (e.g. Teng et al. 2017), respectively."

It has been estimated that the amount spent on fossil fuel subsidies was around double the amount of subsidies spent on renewables (IEA 2018b). There are adverse environmental, economic and social consequences of fossil fuel subsidies (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). More than 75% of the distortions created by fossil fuel subsidies are domestic, and studies indicate that reforming them can have substantial in-country benefits (Coady et al. 2017, 2019).

However, the subsidies have proven to be regressive in most cases, with little benefit reaching the poor (Lockwood 2015). For example, Indonesia has introduced LPG subsidies for cooking. The kerosene-to-LPG conversion programme (‘Zero Kero’) was launched in 2007 and provided mainly households with free initial LPG equipment and LPG at a low subsidised price (Imelda et al. 2018 b; Thoday et al. 2018). Besides the national government, provincial governments and industry played a crucial role in implementation. Overall, the LPG conversion programme in Indonesia reduced cooking kerosene use (Andadari et al. 2014; Imelda et al. 2018 b) and GHG emissions (Permadi et al. 2017) with positive health effects (Imelda et al. 2018 b; Thoday et al. 2018).

The climate impacts of switching from biomass to LPG depend on the degree of biomass combustion in stoves and the extent to which biomass originates from non-renewable sources (Singh and Rao 2015; Jose et al. 2018). Barriers to increasing LPG use for cooking further included abundance of solid fuels at zero (monetary) costs (Mani et al. 2020) as well as benefits of solid fuels, such as maintaining the traditional taste of food and space heating in colder seasons (Gould 2018; Sharma et al. 2020)."

The weighted average cost of PV in 2019 was USD68 MWh –1, near the bottom of the range of fossil fuel prices (IRENA 2019b). The cost of electricity from PV has fallen by 89% since 2000 and 69% since AR5, at a rate of –16% per year. The 5:95 percentile range for PV in 2019 was USD52–190 MWh –1 (IRENA 2021b). Differences in solar insolation, financing costs, equipment acquisition, installation labour, and other sources of price dispersion explain this range (Nemet et al. 2016; Vartiainen et al. 2020) and scale. For example, in India, rooftop installations cost 41% more than utility-scale installations, and commercial-scale costs are 39% higher than utility-scale. Significant differences in regional cost persist (Kazhamiaka et al. 2017; Vartiainen et al. 2020), with particularly low prices in China, India, and parts of Europe. Globally, the range of global PV costs is quite similar to the range of coal and natural gas prices."

Increasingly, the costs of PV electricity are concentrated in the installation and related ‘soft costs’ (marketing, permitting) associated with the technology rather than in the modules themselves, which now account for only 30% of installed costs of rooftop systems (O’Shaughnessy et al. 2019; IRENA 2021b). Financing costs are a significant barrier in developing countries (Ondraczek et al. 2015) and growth there depends on access to low-cost finance (Creutzig et al. 2017)."

The lowest prices for CSP are now competitive with more expensive fossil fuels, although the average CSP cost is above the range for fossil-based power generation. Other data sources put recent CSP costs at USD120 MWh –1, in the middle of the fossil range (Lilliestam et al. 2020). Continuing the pace of change since AR5 will make CSP competitive with fossil fuels in sunny locations, although it will be difficult for CSP to compete with PV and even hybrid PV-battery systems. CSP electricity can be more valuable, however, because CSP systems can store heat longer than PV battery systems."

The total costs of PV include grid integration, which varies tremendously depending on PV’s share of electricity, other supply sources like wind, availability of storage, transmission capacity, and demand flexibility (Heptonstall and Gross 2020). Transmission costs can add USD1–10 MWh –1 or 3–33% to the cost of utility-scale PV (Gorman et al. 2019). Distributed (rooftop) PV involves a broader set of grid integration costs – including grid reinforcement, voltage balancing and control, and impacts on other generations – and has a larger range of integration costs from USD2–25 MWh –1, which is –3% to +37% (Hirth et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2015; Gorman et al. 2019). Other meta-analyses put the range at USD1–7 MWh –1 in the USA (Luckow et al. 2015.; Wiser et al. 2017), while a comprehensive study put the range at USD12–18 MWh –1 for up to 35% renewables and USD25–46 MWh –1 above 35% renewables (Heptonstall and Gross 2020). Increased system flexibility can reduce integration costs of solar energy (Wu et al. 2015) including storage, demand response, sector-coupling (Brown et al. 2018; Bogdanov et al. 2019), and increase complementarity between wind and solar (Heide et al. 2010) (Sections 6.4.3 and 6.4.4)."

Continued cost reductions help address this issue of value deflation, but only partially. Comprehensive solutions depend on adding transmission and storage (Das et al. 2020) and, more fundamentally, adjustments to electricity market design (Roques and Finon 2017; Bistline and Young 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"The most important ways to minimise PV’s impact on the environment lie in recycling materials at end of life and making smart land-use decisions (medium confidence). A comprehensive assessment of PV’s environmental impacts requires lifecycle analysis (LCA) of resource depletion, land-use, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, acidification, ozone, and particulates, among other things (Mahmud et al. 2018). LCA studies show that solar PVs produce far less CO2 per unit of electricity than fossil generation, but PV CO2 emissions vary due to the carbon intensity of manufacturing energy and offset electricity (Grant and Hicks 2020). Concerns about systemic impacts, such as reducing the Earth’s albedo by covering surfaces with dark panels, have shown to be trivial compared to the mitigation benefits (Nemet 2009) (Box 6.7). Even though GHG LCA estimates span a considerable range of 9–250 gCO2 kWh –1 (de Wild-Scholten 2013; Kommalapati et al. 2017), recent studies that reflect higher efficiencies and manufacturing improvements find lower lifecycle emissions, including a range of 18–60 gCO2 kWh –1 (Wetzel and Borchers 2015) and central estimates of 80 gCO2 kWh –1 (Hou et al. 2016), 50 gCO2 kWh –1 (Nugent and Sovacool 2014), and 20 gCO2 kWh –1 (Louwen et al. 2016). These recent values are an order of magnitude lower than coal, and natural gas and further decarbonisation of the energy system will make them lower still. Thin films and organics produce half the lifecycle emissions of silicon wafer PV, mainly because they use less material (Lizin et al. 2013; Hou et al. 2016). Novel materials promise even lower environmental impacts, especially with improvements to their performance ratios and reliability (Gong et al. 2015; Muteri et al. 2020). Higher efficiencies, longer lifetimes, sunny locations, less carbon-intensive manufacturing inputs, and shifting to thin films could reduce future lifecycle impacts."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"Another environmental concern with large PV power plants is the conversion of land to collect solar energy (Hernandez et al. 2015). Approximately 2 hectares of land are needed for 1 MW of solar electricity capacity (Perpiña Castillo et al. 2016; Kabir et al. 2018); at 20% efficiency, a square of PV panels of 550 km by 550 km, comprising 0.2% of Earth’s land area, could meet global energy demand. Land conversion can have local impacts, especially near cities and where land used for solar competes with alternative uses, such as agriculture. Large installations can also adversely impact biodiversity (Hernandez et al. 2014), especially where the above-ground vegetation is cleared and soils are typically graded. Landscape fragmentation creates barriers to the movement of species. However, a variety of means have emerged to mitigate land use issues. Substitution among renewables can reduce land conversion (Tröndle 2020). Solar can be integrated with other uses through ‘agrivoltaics’ (the use of land for both agriculture and solar production) (Dupraz et al. 2011) by, for example, using shade-tolerant crops (Dinesh and Pearce 2016). Combining solar and agriculture can also create income diversification, reduced drought stress, higher solar output due to radiative cooling, and other benefits (Elamri et al. 2018; Hassanpour Adeh et al. 2018; Barron-Gafford et al. 2019). PV installations floating on water also avoid land-use conflicts (Sahu et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2020), as does dual-use infrastructure, such as landfills (Jäger-Waldau 2020) and reservoirs where evaporation can also be reduced (Farfan and Breyer 2018)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p12,NO_TITLE,"Material demand for PV will likely increase substantially to limit warming to well below 2°C, but PV materials are widely available, have possible substitutes, and can be recycled (medium confidence) (Box 6.4). The primary materials for PV are silicon, copper, glass, aluminium, and silver – the costliest being silicon, and glass being the most essential by mass, at 70%. None of these materials is considered to be either critical or potentially scarce (IEA 2020e). Thin-film cells, such as amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), use far less material (though they use more glass), but account for less than 10% of the global solar market. Other thin-films, such as those based on perovskites, organic solar cells, or earth-abundant, non-toxic materials such as kesterites, either on their own, or layered on silicon, could further reduce material use per energy produced (Box 6.4)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p13,NO_TITLE,"After a typical lifetime of 30 years of use, PV modules can be recycled to prevent environmental contamination from the toxic materials within them, reusing valuable materials and avoiding waste accumulation. Recycling allows the reuse of nearly all – 83% in one study – of the components of PV modules, other than plastics (Ardente et al. 2019) and would add less than 1% to lifecycle GHG emissions (Latunussa et al. 2016). Glass accounts for 70% of the mass of a solar cell and is relatively easy to recycle. Recycling technology is advancing, but the scale and share of recycling is still small (Li et al. 2020d). By 2050, however, end-of-life PV could total 80 MT and comprise 10% of global electronic waste (Stolz and Frischknecht 2017), although most of it is glass. IEA runs a programme to enable PV recycling by sharing best practices to minimise recycling lifecycle impacts. Ensuring that a substantial amount of panels are recycled at end of life will likely require policy incentives, as the market value of the recovered materials, aside from aluminium and copper, is likely to be too low to justify recycling on its own (Deng et al. 2019). A near-term priority is maximising the recovery of silver, silicon, and aluminium, the most valuable PV material components (Heath et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p14,NO_TITLE,"Many alternative PV materials are improving in efficiency and stability, providing longer-term pathways for continued PV costs reductions and better performance ( high confidence). While solar PV based on semi-conductors constructed from wafers of silicon still captures 90% of the market, new designs and materials have the potential to reduce costs further, increase efficiency, reduce resource use, and open new applications. The most significant technological advance within silicon PV in the past 10 years has been the widespread adoption of the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) design (Green 2015), which now accounts for the majority of production. This advance boosts efficiency over traditional aluminium backing by increasing reflectivity within the cell and reducing electron-hole recombination (Blakers 2019). Bifacial modules increase efficiency by using reflected light from the ground or roof on the backside of modules (Guerrero-Lemus et al. 2016). Integrating PV into buildings can reduce overall costs and improve building energy performance (Shukla et al. 2016). Concentrating PV uses lenses or mirrors that collect and concentrate light onto high efficiency PV cells (Li et al. 2020a). Beyond crystalline silicon, thin films of amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide (among others) have the potential for much lower costs while their efficiencies have increased (Green et al. 2019). Perovskites, inexpensive and easy to produce crystalline structures, have increased in efficiency by a factor of six in the past decade; the biggest challenge is light-induced degradation as well as finding lead-free efficient compounds, or establishing lead recycling at the end of the lifecycle of the device (Petrus et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019b; Zhu et al. 2020). Organic solar cells are made of carbon-based semiconductors like the ones found in the displays made from organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and can be processed in thin films on large areas with scalable and fast coating processes on plastic substrates. The main challenges are raising the efficiency and improving their lifetime (Ma et al. 2020; Riede et al. 2021). Quantum dots, spherical semi-conductor nanocrystals, can be tuned to absorb specific wavelengths of sunlight, giving them the potential for high efficiency with very little material use (Kramer et al. 2015). A common challenge for all emerging solar cell technologies is developing the corresponding production equipment. Hybrids of silicon with layers of quantum dots and perovskites have the potential to take advantage of the benefits of all three, although those designs require that these new technologies have stability and scale that match those of silicon (Chang et al. 2017; Palmstrom et al. 2019). This broad array of alternatives to making PV from crystalline silicon offer realistic potential for lower costs, reduced material use, and higher efficiencies in future years (Victoria et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p15,NO_TITLE,"Besides PV, alternative solar technologies exist, including CSP, which can provide special services in high-temperature heat and diurnal storage, even if it is more costly than PV and its potential for deployment is limited. CSP uses reflective surfaces, such as parabolic mirrors, to focus sunlight on a receiver to heat a working fluid, which is subsequently transformed into electricity (Islam et al. 2018). Solar heating and cooling are also well established technologies, and solar energy can be utilised directly for domestic or commercial applications such as drying, heating, cooling, and cooking (Ge et al. 2018). Solar chimneys, (still purely conceptual), heat air using large transparent greenhouse-like structures and channel the warm air to turbines in tall chimneys (Kasaeian et al. 2017). Solar energy can also be used to produce solar fuels, for example, hydrogen or synthetic gas (syngas) (Montoya et al. 2016; Nocera 2017; Detz et al. 2018). In addition, research proceeds on space-based solar PV, which takes advantage of high insolation and a continuous solar resource (Kelzenberg et al. 2018), but faces the formidable obstacle of developing safe, efficient, and inexpensive microwave or laser transmission to the Earth’s surface (Yang et al. 2016). CSP is the most widely adopted of these alternative solar technologies."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.1_p16,NO_TITLE,"Like PV, CSP facilities can deliver large amounts of power (up to 200 MW per unit) and maintain substantial thermal storage, which is valuable for load balancing over the diurnal cycle (McPherson et al. 2020). However, unlike PV, CSP can only use direct sunlight, constraining its cost-effectiveness to North Africa, the Middle East, Southern Africa, Australia, the Western USA, parts of South America (Peru, Chile), and the Western part of China (Deng et al. 2015; Dupont et al. 2020). Parabolic troughs, central towers and parabolic dishes are the three leading solar thermal technologies (Wang et al. 2017d). Parabolic troughs represented approximately 70% of new capacity in 2018 with the balance made up by central tower plants (Islam et al. 2018). Especially promising research directions are on tower-based designs that can achieve high temperatures, useful for industrial heat and energy storage (Mehos et al. 2017), and direct steam generation designs (Islam et al. 2018). Costs of CSP have fallen by nearly half since AR5 (Figure 6.8) albeit at a slower rate than PV. Since AR5, almost all new CSP plants have storage (Figure 6.9) (Thonig 2020)."

Solar energy is perceived as clean and environmentally friendly with few downsides (Faiers and Neame 2006; Whitmarsh et al. 2011b). Key motivations for homeowners to adopt PV systems are expected financial gains, environmental benefits, the desire to become more self-sufficient, and peer expectations (Korcaj et al. 2015; Vasseur and Kemp 2015; Palm 2017). Hence, the observability of PV systems can facilitate adoption (Boudet 2019). The main barriers to the adoption of solar PV by households are its high upfront costs, aesthetics, landlord-tenant incentives, and concerns about performance and reliability (Faiers and Neame 2006; Whitmarsh et al. 2011b; Vasseur and Kemp 2015)."

wg3_ch06_6.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Energy from wind is abundant, and the estimated technical potentials surpass the total amount of energy needed to limit warming to well below 2°C ( high confidence). Recent global estimates of potentially exploitable wind energy resource are in the range of 557–717 PWh yr –1 (2005–2580 EJ yr –1) (Eurek et al. 2017; Bosch et al. 2017, 2018; McKenna et al. 2022), or 20–30 times the 2017 global electricity demand. Studies have suggested that ‘bottom-up’ approaches may overestimate technical potentials (Miller et al. 2015; Kleidon and Miller 2020). But even in the most conservative ‘top-down’ approaches, the technical wind potential surpasses the amount needed to limit warming to well below 2°C (Bosch et al. 2017; Eurek et al. 2017; Volker et al. 2017). The projected climate change mitigation from wind energy by 2100 ranges from 0.3°C–0.8°C depending on the precise socio-economic pathway and wind energy expansion scenario followed (Barthelmie and Pryor 2021). Wind resources are unevenly distributed over the globe and by time of the year (Petersen and Troen 2012), but potential hotspots exist on every continent (Figure 6.10) as expressed by the wind power density (a quantitative measure of wind energy available at any location). Technical potentials for onshore wind power vary considerably, often because of inconsistent assessments of suitability factors (McKenna et al. 2020). The potential for offshore wind power is larger than for onshore because offshore wind is stronger and less variable (Bosch et al. 2018). Offshore wind is more expensive, however, because of higher costs for construction, maintenance, and transmission. Wind power varies at a range of time scales, from annual to sub-seconds; the effects of local short-term variability can be offset by power plant control, flexible grid integration, and storage (Barra et al. 2021) (Section 6.4.3). In some regions, interannual variations in wind energy resources could be important for optimal power system design (Wohland et al. 2019a; Coker et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Wind power cost reductions (Figure 6.11) are driven mainly by larger capacity turbines, larger rotor diameters and taller hub heights – larger swept areas increase the energy captured and the capacity factors for a given wind speed; taller towers provide access to higher wind speeds (Beiter et al. 2021). All major onshore wind markets have experienced rapid growth in both rotor diameter (from 81.2 m in 2010 to 120 m in 2020) (IRENA 2021b), and average power ratings (from 1.9 MW in 2010 to 3 MW in 2020). The generation capacity of offshore wind turbines grew by a factor of 3.7 in less than two decades, from 1.6 MW in 2000 to 6 MW in 2020 (Wiser et al. 2021). Floating foundations could revolutionise offshore wind power by tapping into the abundant wind potential in deeper waters. This technology is particularly important for regions where coastal waters are too deep for fixed-bottom wind turbines. Floating wind farms potentially offer economic and environmental benefits compared with fixed-bottom designs due to less-invasive activity on the seabed during installation, but the long-term ecological effects are unknown and meteorological conditions further offshore and in deeper waters are harsher on wind turbine components (IRENA 2019c). A radical new class of wind energy converters has also been conceived under the name of airborne wind energy systems that can harvest strong, high-altitude winds (typically between 200–800m), which are inaccessible by traditional wind turbines (Cherubini et al. 2015). This technology has seen development and testing of small devices (Watson et al. 2019)."

The capacity factor for onshore wind farms increased from 27% in 2010 to 36% in 2020 (IRENA 2021a). The global average offshore capacity factor has decreased from a peak of 45% in 2017. This has been driven by the increased share of offshore development in China, where projects are often near-shore and use smaller wind turbines than in Europe (IRENA 2021b). Improvements in capacity factors also come from increased functionality of wind turbines and wind farms. Manufactures can adapt the wind turbine generator to the wind conditions. Turbines for windy sites have smaller generators and smaller specific capacity per rotor area, and therefore operate more efficiently and reach full capacity for a longer time period (Rohrig et al. 2019)."

Total installed costs for both onshore and offshore wind farms have decreased since 2015 (Figure 6.11), but the total installed costs for onshore wind projects are very site- and market-specific, as reflected in the range of LCOEs. China, India, and the USA have experienced the largest declines in total installed costs. In 2020, typical country-average total installed costs were around USD1150 kW–1 in China and India, and between USD1403–2472 kW–1 elsewhere (IRENA 2021b). Total installed costs of offshore wind farms declined by 12% between 2010 and 2020. But, because some of the new offshore wind projects have moved to deeper waters and further offshore, there are considerable year-to-year variations in their price (IRENA 2021b). Projects outside China in recent years have typically been built in deeper waters (10–55 m) and up to 120 km offshore, compared to around 10 m in 2001–2006, when distances rarely exceeded 20 km. With the shift to deeper waters and sites further from ports, the total installed costs of offshore wind farms rose, from an average of around USD2500 kW–1 in 2000 to around USD5127 kW–1 by 2011–2014, before falling to around USD3185 kW–1 in 2020 (IRENA 2020a). The full cost of wind power includes the transmission and system integration costs (Sections 6.4.3 and 6.4.6). A new technology in development is the co-location of wind and solar PV power farms, also known as hybrid power plants. Co-locating wind, solar PV, and batteries can lead to synergies in electricity generation, infrastructure, and land usage, which may lower the overall plant cost compared to single technology systems (Lindberg et al. 2021)."

Many countries now require environmental studies of impacts of wind turbines on wildlife prior to project development, and, in some regions, shutdowns are required during active bird migration (de Lucas et al. 2012). Offshore wind farms can also impact migratory birds and other sea species (Hooper et al. 2017). Floating foundations pose lower environmental impacts at build stage (IRENA 2019c), but their cumulative long-term impacts are unclear (Goodale and Milman 2016).

Below dams, there can be considerable alterations to vegetation, natural river flows, retention of sediments and nutrients, and water quality and temperature. Construction of large reservoirs leads to loss of land, which may result in social and environmental consequences. Minimising societal and environmental impacts requires taking into account local physical, environmental, climatological, social, economic, and political aspects during the planning stage (Killingtveit 2020).

This is especially critical in the case of trans-boundary hydroelectric power plants, where filling up the reservoirs can have large implications on downstream users in other nations. As a result of social and environmental constraints, only a small fraction of potential economic hydropower projects can be developed, especially in developed countries. Many developing countries have major undeveloped hydropower potential, and there are opportunities to develop hydropower combined with other economic activities such as irrigation (Lacombe et al. 2014).

One of the key limiting factors associated with geologic CO2 storage is the global distribution of storage capacity (Table 6.2). Most of the available storage capacity exists in saline aquifers.

Notably, not all geologic storage is utilisable. In places with limited geologic storage, international CCS chains are being considered, where sources and sinks of CO2 are located in two or more countries (Sharma and Xu 2021).

CCU involves using CO2 as a feedstock to synthesise products of economic value and as substitute to fossil feedstock. However, several CO2 utilisation avenues might be limited by energy availability. Depending on the utilisation pathway, the CO2 may be considered sequestered for centuries (e.g., cement curing, aggregates), decades (plastics), or only a few days or months (e.g., fuels) (Hepburn et al. 2019). Moreover, when carbon-rich fuel end-products are combusted, CO2 is emitted back into the atmosphere.

Injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon formations for enhanced oil or gas recovery can produce revenues and lower costs (Edwards and Celia 2018). While enhanced oil recovery potential is <5% of the actual CCS needs, they can enable early pilot and demonstration projects (Núñez-López and Moskal 2019; Núñez-López et al. 2019). Substantial portions of CO2 are effectively stored during enhanced oil recovery (Menefee and Ellis 2020; Sminchak et al. 2020). By clustering together of several CO2 sources, overall costs may be reduced by USD10 tCO2–1 (Abotalib et al. 2016; Garg et al. 2017a), but geographical circumstances determine the prospects of these cost reductions via economies of scale. The major pathways for CO2 utilisation via methanol, methane, liquid fuel production, and cement curing have costs greater than USD500 tCO2–1 (Hepburn et al. 2019).

Different chemical and biological conversion pathways exist to convert diverse biomass feedstocks into multiple final energy carriers (Figure 6.14). Currently, biomass is mostly used to produce heat, or for cooking purposes (traditional biomass), electricity, or first-generation sugar-based biofuels (e.g., ethanol produced via fermentation), as well as biodiesel produced from vegetable oils and animal fats. Electricity generated from biomass contributes about 3% of global generation. Tens of billions of gallons of first-generation biofuels are produced per year. The processing requirements (drying, dewatering, pelletising) of different feedstocks for producing electricity from biomass are energy-intensive, and when utilising current power plants, the efficiency is around 22%, with an increase up to 28% with advanced technologies (Zhang et al. 2020)."

These pathways could deliver several final energy carriers starting from multiple feedstocks, including forest biomass, dedicated cellulosic feedstocks, crop residues, and wastes (Figure 6.14). While potentially cost-competitive in the future, pyrolysis, Fischer-Tropsch, and HTL are not currently cost-competitive (IEA 2018c; Molino et al. 2018; Prussi et al. 2019), and scaling-up these processes will require robust business strategies and optimised use of co-products (Lee and Lavoie 2013). Advanced biofuels production processes are at the pilot or demonstration stage and will require substantial breakthroughs or market changes to become competitive. Moreover, fuels produced from these processes require upgrading to reach ‘drop-in’ conditions – that is, conditions in which they may be used directly consistent with current standards in existing technologies (van Dyk et al. 2019). Additional opportunities exist to co-optimise second-generation biofuels and engines (Ostadi et al. 2019; Salman et al. 2020). In addition, gaseous wastes, or high-moisture biomass, such as dairy manure, wastewater sludge and organic municipal solid waste (MSW) could be utilised to produce renewable natural gas. Technologies for producing biogas (e.g., digestion) tend to be less efficient than thermochemical approaches and often produce large amounts of CO2, requiring the produced fuels to undergo significant upgrading (Melara et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"A major scale-up of bioenergy production will require dedicated production of advanced biofuels. First-generation biofuels produced directly from food crops or animal fats have limited potential and lower yield per land area than advanced biofuels. Wastes and residues (e.g., from agricultural, forestry, animal manure processing) or biomass grown on degraded, surplus, and marginal land can provide opportunities for cost-effective and sustainable bioenergy at significant but limited scale (Morris et al. 2013; Saha and Eckelman 2018; Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2020; Spagnolo et al. 2020). Assessing the potential for a major scale-up of purpose-grown bioenergy is challenging due to its far-reaching linkages to issues beyond the energy sector, including competition with land for food production and forestry, water use, impacts on ecosystems, and land-use change (IPCC 2020; Roe et al. 2021) (Chapter 12). These factors, rather than geophysical characteristics, largely define the potential for bioenergy and explain the difference in estimates of potential in the literature. Biomass resources are not always in close proximity to energy demand, necessitating additional infrastructure or means to transport biomass or final bioenergy over larger distances and incur additional energy use (Baik et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.6_p7,NO_TITLE,"An important feature of bioenergy is that it can be used to remove carbon from the atmosphere by capturing CO2 in different parts of the conversion process and then permanently storing the CO2 (BECCS or biochar) (Smith et al. 2016; Fuss et al. 2018) (Chapters 3 and 7, and Section 12.5). Some early opportunities for low-cost BECCS are being utilised in the ethanol sector but these are applicable only in the near-term at the scale of ≤100 MtCO2 yr –1 (Sanchez et al. 2018). Several technological and institutional barriers exist for large-scale BECCS implementation, including large energy requirements for CCS, limit and cost of biomass supply and geologic sinks for CO2 in several regions, and cost of CO2 capture technologies ( high confidence). Besides BECCS, biofuels production through pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction creates biochar, which could also be used to store carbon as 80% of the carbon sequestered in biochar will remain in the biochar permanently (Chapter 7). In addition to its ability to sequester carbon, biochar can be used as a soil amendment (Wang et al. 2014b)."

These costs are context-dependent, and regions having large waste resources are already producing low-cost bioenergy (Jin and Sutherland 2018). In the future, technology costs are anticipated to decrease, but bioenergy produced through cellulosic feedstocks may remain more expensive than fossil alternatives. Large-scale deployment of early opportunities, especially in the liquid fuel sector, may reduce the technological costs associated with biomass conversion (IEA 2020g). At the same time, the cost of feedstocks may rise as bioenergy requirements increase, especially in scenarios with large bioenergy deployment (Muratori et al. 2020).

While these processes have fewer ongoing prototypes/demonstrations, the costs of biomass-based hydrogen (with or without CCS) are substantially cheaper than that produced from electrolysis utilising solar/wind resources (Kayfeci et al. 2019; Newborough and Cooley 2020), even though electrolysis costs are dropping."

Large-scale international trade of biomass might be required to support a global bioeconomy, raising questions about infrastructure, logistics, financing options, and global standards for bioenergy production and trade (Box 6.10).

Below dams, there can be considerable alterations to vegetation, natural river flows, retention of sediments and nutrients, and water quality and temperature. Construction of large reservoirs leads to loss of land, which may result in social and environmental consequences. Minimising societal and environmental impacts requires taking into account local physical, environmental, climatological, social, economic, and political aspects during the planning stage (Killingtveit 2020). Moreover, when large areas of land are flooded by dam construction, they generate GHGs (Prairie et al. 2018; Phyoe and Wang 2019; Maavara et al. 2020). On the other hand, hydropower provides flexible, competitive low-emission electricity, local economic benefits (e.g., by increasing irrigation and electricity production in developing countries), and ancillary services such as municipal water supply, irrigation and drought management, navigation and recreation, and flood control (IRENA 2021b).

This is especially critical in the case of trans-boundary hydroelectric power plants, where filling up the reservoirs can have large implications on downstream users in other nations. As a result of social and environmental constraints, only a small fraction of potential economic hydropower projects can be developed, especially in developed countries. Many developing countries have major undeveloped hydropower potential, and there are opportunities to develop hydropower combined with other economic activities such as irrigation (Lacombe et al. 2014).

Not all the storage capacity is usable because geologic and engineering factors limit the actual storage capacity to an order of magnitude below the theoretical potential, which is still more than the CO2 storage requirement through 2100 to limit temperature change to 1.5°C (Martin-Roberts et al. 2021) ( high confidence). One of the key limiting factors associated with geologic CO2 storage is the global distribution of storage capacity (Table 6.2). Most of the available storage capacity exists in saline aquifers. Capacity in oil and gas reservoirs and coalbed methane fields is limited. Storage potential in the USA alone is >1000 GtCO2, which is more than 10% of the world total (NETL 2015). The Middle East has more than 50% of global enhanced oil recovery potential (Selosse and Ricci 2017). It is likely that oil and gas reservoirs will be developed as geologic sinks before saline aquifers because of existing infrastructure and extensive subsurface data (Alcalde et al. 2019; Hastings and Smith 2020). Notably, not all geologic storage is utilisable. In places with limited geologic storage, international CCS chains are being considered, where sources and sinks of CO2 are located in two or more countries (Sharma and Xu 2021). For economic long-term storage, the desirable conditions are a depth of 800–3000 m, thickness of greater than 50 m and permeability greater than 500 mD (Chadwick et al. 2008; Singh et al. 2021). Even in reservoirs with large storage potential, the rate of injection might be limited by the subsurface pressure of the reservoir (Baik et al. 2018). It is estimated that geologic sequestration is reliable with overall leakage rates at <0.001% yr –1 (Alcalde et al. 2018). In many cases, geological storage resources are not located close to CO2 sources, increasing costs and reducing viability (Garg et al. 2017a)."

CCU involves using CO2 as a feedstock to synthesise products of economic value and as substitute to fossil feedstock. However, several CO2 utilisation avenues might be limited by energy availability. Depending on the utilisation pathway, the CO2 may be considered sequestered for centuries (e.g., cement curing, aggregates), decades (plastics), or only a few days or months (e.g., fuels) (Hepburn et al. 2019). Moreover, when carbon-rich fuel end-products are combusted, CO2 is emitted back into the atmosphere. Because of the presence of several industrial clusters (regions with high density of industrial infrastructure) globally, a number of regions demonstrate locations where CO2 utilisation potential could be matched with large point sources of CO2 (Wei et al. 2020)."

For instance, urea production requires CO2 pressurised to 122 bar and purified to 99.9%. While most utilisation pathways require purity levels of 95–99%, algae production may be carried out with atmospheric CO2 (Voldsund et al. 2016; Ho et al. 2019)."

There has been significant progress in post-combustion capture technologies that used absorption in solvents such as monoethanolamine (MEA). There are commercial-scale application of solvent-based absorption at two electricity generating facilities – Boundary Dam since 2015 and Petra Nova (temporarily suspended) since 2017, with capacities of 1 and 1.6 MtCO2 yr –1 respectively (Mantripragada et al. 2019; Giannaris et al. 2020 a). Several second- and third-generation capture technologies are being developed with the aim of not just lowering costs but also enhancing other performance characteristics such as improved ramp-up and lower water consumption. These include processes such as chemical looping, which also has the advantage of being capable of co-firing with biomass with a better efficiency (Bhave et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2019). Another important technological development is the Allam cycle, which utilises CO2 as a working fluid and operates based on oxy-combustion capture. Applications using the Allam Cycle can deliver net energy efficiency greater than 50% and nearly 100% CO2 capture, but they are quite sensitive to oxygen and CO2 purity needs (Scaccabarozzi et al. 2016; Ferrari et al. 2017)."

The potential for such reductions is limited in several regions due to low sink availability, but it could jump-start initial investments (medium confidence). Injecting CO2 into hydrocarbon formations for enhanced oil or gas recovery can produce revenues and lower costs (Edwards and Celia 2018). While enhanced oil recovery potential is <5% of the actual CCS needs, they can enable early pilot and demonstration projects (Núñez-López and Moskal 2019; Núñez-López et al. 2019). Substantial portions of CO2 are effectively stored during enhanced oil recovery (Menefee and Ellis 2020; Sminchak et al. 2020). By clustering together of several CO2 sources, overall costs may be reduced by USD10 tCO2–1 (Abotalib et al. 2016; Garg et al. 2017a), but geographical circumstances determine the prospects of these cost reductions via economies of scale. The major pathways for CO2 utilisation via methanol, methane, liquid fuel production, and cement curing have costs greater than USD500 tCO2–1 (Hepburn et al. 2019). The success of these pathways therefore depends on the value of such fuels and on the values of other alternatives."

The increase is slightly lower for non-absorption technologies. In regions prone to water scarcity such as the Southwestern USA or Southeast Asia, this may limit deployment and result in power plant shutdowns during the summer months (Liu et al. 2019b; Wang et al. 2019c).

Currently, biomass is mostly used to produce heat, or for cooking purposes (traditional biomass), electricity, or first-generation sugar-based biofuels (e.g., ethanol produced via fermentation), as well as biodiesel produced from vegetable oils and animal fats. Electricity generated from biomass contributes about 3% of global generation. Tens of billions of gallons of first-generation biofuels are produced per year. The processing requirements (drying, dewatering, pelletising) of different feedstocks for producing electricity from biomass are energy-intensive, and when utilising current power plants, the efficiency is around 22%, with an increase up to 28% with advanced technologies (Zhang et al. 2020)."

While potentially cost-competitive in the future, pyrolysis, Fischer-Tropsch, and HTL are not currently cost-competitive (IEA 2018c; Molino et al. 2018; Prussi et al. 2019), and scaling-up these processes will require robust business strategies and optimised use of co-products (Lee and Lavoie 2013). Advanced biofuels production processes are at the pilot or demonstration stage and will require substantial breakthroughs or market changes to become competitive. Moreover, fuels produced from these processes require upgrading to reach ‘drop-in’ conditions – that is, conditions in which they may be used directly consistent with current standards in existing technologies (van Dyk et al. 2019). Additional opportunities exist to co-optimise second-generation biofuels and engines (Ostadi et al. 2019; Salman et al. 2020). In addition, gaseous wastes, or high-moisture biomass, such as dairy manure, wastewater sludge and organic municipal solid waste (MSW) could be utilised to produce renewable natural gas.

Assessing the potential for a major scale-up of purpose-grown bioenergy is challenging due to its far-reaching linkages to issues beyond the energy sector, including competition with land for food production and forestry, water use, impacts on ecosystems, and land-use change (IPCC 2020; Roe et al. 2021) (Chapter 12). These factors, rather than geophysical characteristics, largely define the potential for bioenergy and explain the difference in estimates of potential in the literature. Biomass resources are not always in close proximity to energy demand, necessitating additional infrastructure or means to transport biomass or final bioenergy over larger distances and incur additional energy use (Baik et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2021)."

Some early opportunities for low-cost BECCS are being utilised in the ethanol sector but these are applicable only in the near-term at the scale of ≤100 MtCO2 yr –1 (Sanchez et al. 2018). Several technological and institutional barriers exist for large-scale BECCS implementation, including large energy requirements for CCS, limit and cost of biomass supply and geologic sinks for CO2 in several regions, and cost of CO2 capture technologies ( high confidence). Besides BECCS, biofuels production through pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction creates biochar, which could also be used to store carbon as 80% of the carbon sequestered in biochar will remain in the biochar permanently (Chapter 7).

In the future, technology costs are anticipated to decrease, but bioenergy produced through cellulosic feedstocks may remain more expensive than fossil alternatives. Large-scale deployment of early opportunities, especially in the liquid fuel sector, may reduce the technological costs associated with biomass conversion (IEA 2020g).

wg3_ch06_box-6.5_p1,Fossil Energy ,"Methane emissions mainly from coal, oil, and gas currently represent in 2019 about 18% of energy supply sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 90% of global energy supply non-CO2 emissions in 2019 (Minx et al. 2021 b). While approximately 80% of the lifecycle methane emissions in the coal sector occur during underground mining, oil and gas emissions are spread throughout upstream, midstream, and downstream stages (Alvarez et al. 2018; IPCC 2019). For this reason, methane reductions from coal mining can be accomplished through coal mine methane recovery (where methane and coal are recovered simultaneously) and from the ventilation air, which can cumulatively reduce methane emissions by 50–75% (Zhou et al. 2016; Singh and Hajra 2018). Governments incentivise such operations through a number of emissions trading and offset programmes (Haya et al. 2020). Methane emissions in the oil and gas sector can be reduced by leak detection and repair, relevant across varying time scales (hours to decades) and regional scopes (component/facility level to continental) (Fox et al. 2019). Around 50% of the methane emitted from oil and gas infrastructure can be mitigated at net-negative costs; that is, the market price of the recovered methane is higher than the mitigation costs (IEA 2021e). As CO2 emissions are reduced and fossil fuel consumption decreases, methane emissions associated with these supply chains are anticipated to decline (Section 6.7). That said, substantial ‘legacy’ methane emissions – methane leaks after abandonment – will remain, even if a complete fossil fuel phase-out takes place. These legacy emissions are estimated to be less than 1–4% of overall methane emissions across all fossil fuel sources (Kholod et al. 2020; Williams et al. 2021b). Even without a complete phase-out, 50–80% of methane emissions from coal, oil and gas could be avoided with currently available technologies at less than USD50 tCO2-eq –1 (Harmsen et al. 2019; Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020). Methane recovery from abandoned coal mines could offset most project costs (Singh and Sahu 2018). For abandoned oil and gas wells, low plugging costs could be offset through methane recovery, while high plugging costs would likely require some market or policy support (Kang et al. 2019)."

This increase is a result of advanced exploration techniques, which are often subsidised (Lazarus and van Asselt 2018; MA et al. 2018). Fossil reserves are distributed unevenly throughout the globe. Coal represents the largest remaining resource (close to 500 ZJ). Conventional oil and gas resources are an order of magnitude smaller (15–20 ZJ each). Technological advances have increased the reserves of unconventional fossil in the last decade.

Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. The emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et al. 2020). The increase in availability of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 160%. Natural gas liquids could potentially be a lower-carbon alternative to liquid fuels and hydrocarbons. On the demand side, natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen using steam methane reforming, which is a technologically mature process (Sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.5). When combined with 90% CO2 capture, the costs of producing hydrogen are around USD1.5–2 kg(H2)–1 (Collodi et al. 2017; Newborough and Cooley 2020), considerably less than hydrogen produced via electrolysis."

Exploitation of unconventional gas reservoirs is also energy intensive and has led to a reduction in EROI. The primary energy EROI of fossil fuels has converged at about 30, which represents a 20-point decrease from the 1995 value for coal (Brockway et al. 2019). When processing and refining stages are considered, these EROI values further decrease."

wg3_ch06_6.4.2.9_p1,NO_TITLE,"The ocean is a vast source of energy (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). Ocean energy can be extracted from tides, waves, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), currents, and salinity gradients (Bindoff et al. 2019). Their technical potentials, without considering possible exclusion zones, are explored below. Tidal energy, which uses elevation differences between high and low tides, appears in two forms: potential energy (rise and fall of the tide); and current energy (from tidal currents). The global technically harvestable tidal power from areas close to the coast is estimated as about 1.2 PWh yr –1 (4.3 EJ yr –1) (IRENA 2020b). The potential for tidal current energy is estimated to be larger than that for tidal range or barrage (Melikoglu 2018). Ocean wave energy is abundant and predictable and can be extracted directly from surface waves or pressure fluctuations below the surface (Melikoglu 2018). Its global theoretical potential is 29.5 PWh yr –1 (106 EJ yr –1),which means that wave energy alone could meet all global energy demand (Mørk et al. 2010; IRENA 2020b). The temperature gradients in the ocean can be exploited to produce energy, and its total estimated available resource could be up to 44.0 PWh yr –1 (158 EJ yr –1) (Rajagopalan and Nihous 2013). Salinity gradient energy, also known as osmotic power, has a global theoretical potential of over 1.6 PWh yr –1 (6.0 EJ yr –1) (IRENA 2020b). The greatest advantage of most marine energy, excluding wave energy, is that their sources are highly regular and predictable, and energy can be furthermore generated both day and night. An additional use of sea water is to develop lower-cost district cooling systems near the sea (Hunt et al. 2019). The greatest barrier to most marine technology advances is the relatively high upfront costs, uncertainty on environmental regulation and impact, need for investments and insufficient infrastructure (Kempener and Neumann 2014a, b). There are also concerns about technology maturity and performance; thus, not all have the potential to become economically viable (IRENA 2020b)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.10_p1,NO_TITLE,"Waste-to-energy (WTE) is a strategy to recoverenergy from waste in a form of consumable heat, electricity, or fuel (Zhao et al. 2016). Thermal (incineration, gasification, and pyrolysis) and biological (anaerobic digestion and landfill gas to energy) technologies are commonly used (Ahmad et al. 2020). When WTE technologies are equipped with proper air pollution reduction facilities they can contribute to clean electricity production and reduction of GHG emissions. However, if not properly operated, they can exacerbate air quality issues."

It is estimated that treatment of a minimum of 261 million tonnes/year of waste could produce 283 TWh (1 EJ) of power and heat by 2022 (Awasthi et al. 2019). Incineration plants can reduce the mass of waste by 70–80% and the volume of waste by 80–90% (Haraguchi et al. 2019). Incineration technology can reduce water and soil pollution (Gu et al. 2019). However, if not properly handled, dust, and gases such as SO2, HCL, HF, NO2, and dioxins in the flue gases can harm the environment (Mutz et al. 2017). Anaerobic digestion technology has a positive environmental impact and the ability to reduce GHG emissions (Ayodele et al. 2018; Cudjoe et al. 2020). The by-product of the anaerobic digestion process could be used as a nutrient-rich fertiliser for enhancing soil richness for agricultural purposes (Wainaina et al. 2020). Due to the potential negative impacts on domestic environment and residents’ health, WTE projects such as incineration encounter substantial opposition from the local communities in which they are located (Baxter et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2016). Therefore, for WTE to be deployed more widely, policies would need to be tailored with specific guidelines focused on mitigating emissions, which may have an adverse effect on the environment."

While Section 6.4.2.5 discusses the important aspects of CCS with fossil fuels, this section aims to elucidate the feasibility criteria around these fuels itself."

A fraction of these available reserves can be used consistent with mitigation goals when paired with CCS opportunities in close geographical proximity ( high confidence). Based on continued exploration, the fossil fuel resource base has increased significantly; for example, a 9% increase in gas reserves and 12% in oil reserves was observed in the USA between 2017 and 2018. This increase is a result of advanced exploration techniques, which are often subsidised (Lazarus and van Asselt 2018; MA et al. 2018). Fossil reserves are distributed unevenly throughout the globe. Coal represents the largest remaining resource (close to 500 ZJ). Conventional oil and gas resources are an order of magnitude smaller (15–20 ZJ each). Technological advances have increased the reserves of unconventional fossil in the last decade. Discovered ultimate recoverable resources of unconventional oil and gas are comparable to conventional oil and gas (Fizaine et al. 2017)."

Reserves are more likely to be utilised in a low-carbon transition if they can be paired with CCS. Availability of CCS technology not only allows continued use of fossil fuels as a capital resource for countries but also paves the way for CDR through BECCS (Haszeldine 2016; Pye et al. 2020). While the theoretical geologic CO2 sequestration potential is vast, there are limits on how much resource base could be utilised based on geologic, engineering, and source-sink mapping criteria (Budinis et al. 2017)."

Significant decarbonisation potential also exists via diversification of the fossil fuel uses beyond combustion (high evidence). The costs of extracting oil and gas globally have gone down by utilising hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling for resources in unconventional reservoirs (Wachtmeister and Höök 2020). Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. The emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et al. 2020). The increase in availability of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 160%. Natural gas liquids could potentially be a lower-carbon alternative to liquid fuels and hydrocarbons. On the demand side, natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen using steam methane reforming, which is a technologically mature process (Sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.5). When combined with 90% CO2 capture, the costs of producing hydrogen are around USD1.5–2 kg(H2)–1 (Collodi et al. 2017; Newborough and Cooley 2020), considerably less than hydrogen produced via electrolysis."

Similarly, for ongoing underground mining projects, coal mine methane recovery can be economic for major coal producers such as China and India. Coal mine methane and ventilation air methane recovery can reduce the fugitive methane emissions by 50–75% (Zhou et al. 2016; Singh and Sahu 2018)."

Ocean energy can be extracted from tides, waves, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), currents, and salinity gradients (Bindoff et al. 2019). Their technical potentials, without considering possible exclusion zones, are explored below. Tidal energy, which uses elevation differences between high and low tides, appears in two forms: potential energy (rise and fall of the tide); and current energy (from tidal currents). The global technically harvestable tidal power from areas close to the coast is estimated as about 1.2 PWh yr –1 (4.3 EJ yr –1) (IRENA 2020b). The potential for tidal current energy is estimated to be larger than that for tidal range or barrage (Melikoglu 2018). Ocean wave energy is abundant and predictable and can be extracted directly from surface waves or pressure fluctuations below the surface (Melikoglu 2018). Its global theoretical potential is 29.5 PWh yr –1 (106 EJ yr –1),which means that wave energy alone could meet all global energy demand (Mørk et al. 2010; IRENA 2020b). The temperature gradients in the ocean can be exploited to produce energy, and its total estimated available resource could be up to 44.0 PWh yr –1 (158 EJ yr –1) (Rajagopalan and Nihous 2013). Salinity gradient energy, also known as osmotic power, has a global theoretical potential of over 1.6 PWh yr –1 (6.0 EJ yr –1) (IRENA 2020b). The greatest advantage of most marine energy, excluding wave energy, is that their sources are highly regular and predictable, and energy can be furthermore generated both day and night. An additional use of sea water is to develop lower-cost district cooling systems near the sea (Hunt et al. 2019). The greatest barrier to most marine technology advances is the relatively high upfront costs, uncertainty on environmental regulation and impact, need for investments and insufficient infrastructure (Kempener and Neumann 2014a, b). There are also concerns about technology maturity and performance; thus, not all have the potential to become economically viable (IRENA 2020b)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.10_p1,NO_TITLE,"Waste-to-energy (WTE) is a strategy to recoverenergy from waste in a form of consumable heat, electricity, or fuel (Zhao et al. 2016). Thermal (incineration, gasification, and pyrolysis) and biological (anaerobic digestion and landfill gas to energy) technologies are commonly used (Ahmad et al. 2020). When WTE technologies are equipped with proper air pollution reduction facilities they can contribute to clean electricity production and reduction of GHG emissions. However, if not properly operated, they can exacerbate air quality issues."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.10_p2,NO_TITLE,"In 2019, there were more than 1,200 WTE incineration facilities worldwide, with estimated capacity of 310 million tonnes per year (UNECE 2020). It is estimated that treatment of a minimum of 261 million tonnes/year of waste could produce 283 TWh (1 EJ) of power and heat by 2022 (Awasthi et al. 2019). Incineration plants can reduce the mass of waste by 70–80% and the volume of waste by 80–90% (Haraguchi et al. 2019). Incineration technology can reduce water and soil pollution (Gu et al. 2019). However, if not properly handled, dust, and gases such as SO2, HCL, HF, NO2, and dioxins in the flue gases can harm the environment (Mutz et al. 2017). Anaerobic digestion technology has a positive environmental impact and the ability to reduce GHG emissions (Ayodele et al. 2018; Cudjoe et al. 2020). The by-product of the anaerobic digestion process could be used as a nutrient-rich fertiliser for enhancing soil richness for agricultural purposes (Wainaina et al. 2020). Due to the potential negative impacts on domestic environment and residents’ health, WTE projects such as incineration encounter substantial opposition from the local communities in which they are located (Baxter et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2016). Therefore, for WTE to be deployed more widely, policies would need to be tailored with specific guidelines focused on mitigating emissions, which may have an adverse effect on the environment."
wg3_ch06_6.4.2.10_p3,NO_TITLE,"Depending on the origin of the waste used, the integration of WTE and carbon capture and storage (CCS) could enable waste to be a net-zero or even net negative emissions energy source (Kearns 2019; Wienchol et al. 2020). For example, in Europe only, the integration of CCS with WTE facilities has the potential to capture about 60 to 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually (Tota et al. 2021)."

wg3_ch06_6.4.3_p1,Importance of Cross-sector Coupling for Cost-effective Energy System Decarbonisation ,"Greenhouse gases are emitted across all economic activities. Therefore, cost-effective decarbonisation requires a ‘system of systems’ approach that considers the interaction between different energy sectors and systems. Flexibility technologies and advanced control of integrated energy systems (e.g., considering the interaction between electricity, heating/cooling, gas/hydrogen, transport sectors) could reduce energy infrastructure investments substantially in future low-carbon energy systems (Strbac et al. 2015b; Jacobson et al. 2019)."

Integration of large amounts of VRE generation (Hansen et al. 2019), particularly wind and solar generation (Bistline and Young 2019; Perez et al. 2019), presents economic and technical challenges to electricity system management across different time scales from sub-seconds, hours, days, seasons, to multiple years. Furthermore, electrification of segments of the transport and heat sectors could disproportionately increase peak demand relative to supply (Bistline et al. 2021). Increases in peak demand may require reinforcing network infrastructures and generation in the historical passive system operation paradigm (Strbac et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.3_p3,Importance of Cross-sector Coupling for Cost-effective Energy System Decarbonisation ,"These challenges to electricity system management can be addressed through system integration and a digitalised control paradigm involving advanced information and communication technologies. Real-time maintenance of supply-demand balance and sufficient flexibility technologies such as electricity storage, flexible demand, and grid forming converters (Strbac et al. 2015a; López Prol and Schill 2021) would be increasingly valuable for incorporating larger amounts of VRE generation. This flexibility will be particularly important to deal with sudden losses of supply, for example, due to a failure of a large generator or interconnector or a rapid increase in demand (Teng et al. 2017; Chamorro et al. 2020)."

For example, district heating infrastructure can generate both heat and power. Cooling systems and electrified heating systems in buildings can provide flexibility through preheating and precooling via thermal energy storage (Z. Li et al. 2016; G. Li et al. 2017).

Coordinated operation of gas and electricity systems can bring significant benefits in supplying heat demands. For example, hybrid heating can eliminate investment in electricity infrastructure reinforcement by switching to heat pumps in off-peak hours and gas boilers in peak hours (Fischer et al. 2017; Dengiz et al. 2019; Bistline et al. 2021).

A greater proportion of variable renewable sources reduces system inertia, requiring more urgent responses to changes in system frequency, which rapid response storage technologies can provide (stability requires responses within sub-second time scale for provision of frequency and voltage control services). Energy storage also provides intermittent renewable sources with flexibility, allowing them to contribute a greater proportion of electrical energy and avoiding curtailment (capacity firming). Investment costs in backup generation, interconnection, transmission, and distribution network upgrades can thus be reduced (upgrade deferral), meaning that less low-carbon generation will need to be built while still reducing emissions. In the event of an outage, energy storage reserves can keep critical services running (islanding) and restart the grid (black start). The ability to store and release energy as required provides a range of market opportunities for buying and selling of energy (arbitrage)."

Different energy storage technologies can provide these services and support cost-effective energy system decarbonisation (Carbon Trust 2016). To achieve very low-carbon systems, significant volumes of storage will be required (Strbac et al. 2015a; Section 6.4.3.2). There are few mature global supply chains for many of the less-developed energy storage technologies. This means that, although costs today may be relatively high, there are significant opportunities for future cost reductions, both through technology innovation and through manufacturing scale. Adding significant amounts of storage will reduce the price variation and, therefore, the profitability of additional and existing storage, increasing investment risk."
wg3_ch06_6.4.4_p7,Energy Storage Technologies ,"Energy storage extends beyond electricity storage and includes technologies that can store energy as heat, cold, and both liquid and gaseous fuels. Energy storage is a conversion technology, enabling energy to be converted from one form to another. This diversification improves the overall resilience of energy systems, with each system being able to cover supply shortfalls in the others. For example, storage can support the electrification of heating or cooling, as well as transport through electric vehicles, powered by batteries or by fuel cells. Storage significantly reduces the need for costly reinforcement of local distribution networks through smart charging schemes and the ability to flow electricity back to the grid (e.g., through vehicle-to-grid). By capturing otherwise wasted energy streams, such as heat or cold, energy storage improves the efficiency of many systems, such as buildings, data centres and industrial processes."

While lead-acid batteries (LABs) have been widely used for automotive and grid applications for decades (May et al. 2018), LIBs are increasingly being used in grid-scale projects (Crabtree et al. 2015), displacing LABs. The rapid response time of batteries makes them suitable for enhanced frequency regulation and voltage support, enabling the integration of variable renewables into electricity grids (Strbac and Aunedi 2016). Batteries can provide almost all electricity services, except for seasonal storage. LIBs, in particular, can store energy and power in small volumes and with low weight, making them the default choice for EVs (Placke et al. 2017). EV batteries are expected to form a distributed storage resource as this market grows, both impacting and supporting the grid (Staffell and Rustomji 2016)."

Extending the life of the battery can bring down overall costs and mitigate the environmental impacts (Peters et al. 2017). Understanding and controlling battery degradation is therefore important. The liquid, air-reactive electrolytes of conventional LIBs are the main source of their safety issues (Janek and Zeier 2016; Gur 2018), so all-solid-state batteries, in which the electrolyte is a solid, stable material, are being developed. They are expected to be safe, be durable, and have higher energy densities (Janek and Zeier 2016). New chemistries and concepts are being explored, such as lithium-sulphur batteries to achieve even higher energy densities (Van Noorden 2014; Blomgren 2017) and sodium chemistries because sodium is more abundant than lithium (Hwang et al. 2017).

Hydrogen can be produced in various ways and stored in significant quantities in geological formations at moderate pressures, often for long periods, providing seasonal storage (Gabrielli et al. 2020). A core and emerging implementation of PtX is hydrogen production through electrolysers. Hydrogen is a carbon-free fuel holding three times the energy of an equivalent mass of gasoline but occupying a larger volume. An electrolyser uses excess electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through the process of electrolysis. A fuel cell performs the reverse process of recombining hydrogen and oxygen back into water, converting chemical energy into electricity (Elzinga et al. 2014).

Progress in this area includes the development of high-energy supercapacitors, LIB-supercapacitor devices (Gonzalez et al. 2016), and cheaper materials (Wang et al. 2017a), all providing the potential to improve the economic case for supercapacitors, either by reducing manufacturing costs or extending their service portfolio."

When injected into the existing gas infrastructure (Section 6.4.5), it has the added benefit of decarbonising gas (Brandon et al. 2015). Electricity can be used to generate hydrogen, which is then converted back into electricity using combined-cycle gas turbines that have been converted to run on hydrogen. For greater compatibility with existing gas systems and appliances, the hydrogen can be combined with captured carbon dioxide to form methane and other synthetic fuels (Thema et al. 2019), however, methane has high global warming potential and its supply chain emissions have been found to be significant (Balcombe et al. 2013)."

However, portable fuels (hydrogen, methane, ammonia, synthetic hydrocarbons) are useful in certain applications, for example, in energy systems lacking the potential for renewables.

Hydrogen is a flexible fuel with diverse uses, capable of providing electricity, heat, and long-term energy storage for grids, industry, and transport, and has been widely used industrially for decades (Section 6.4.5.1). Hydrogen can be produced in various ways and stored in significant quantities in geological formations at moderate pressures, often for long periods, providing seasonal storage (Gabrielli et al. 2020). A core and emerging implementation of PtX is hydrogen production through electrolysers. Hydrogen is a carbon-free fuel holding three times the energy of an equivalent mass of gasoline but occupying a larger volume. An electrolyser uses excess electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through the process of electrolysis. A fuel cell performs the reverse process of recombining hydrogen and oxygen back into water, converting chemical energy into electricity (Elzinga et al. 2014). Reversible hydrogen fuel cells (RHFCs) can perform both functions in a single device, however, they are still in the pre-commercial stage, due to prohibitive production costs."

Hydrogen can provide long-duration storage to deal with prolonged extreme events, such as very low output of wind generation, to support resilience of future low-carbon energy systems. Research in this technology focuses on improving roundtrip efficiencies, which can be as high as 80% with recycled waste heat and in high-pressure electrolysers, incorporating more efficient compression (Matos et al. 2019).

Hydrogen is considered a modern and clean technology, but people also have safety concerns. Moreover, the public is uncertain about hydrogen storage size and the possibility of storing hydrogen in or near residential areas (Eitan and Fischhendler 2021). Battery storage both on the household and community level was perceived as slightly positive in one study in the UK (Ambrosio-Albala et al. 2020). However, financial costs are seen as a main barrier.

While there is no consensus on the hydrogen production spectrum, ‘blue’ hydrogen (Goldmann and Dinkelacker 2018) generally refers to hydrogen produced from natural gas combined with CCS through processes such as steam methane reforming (SMR) (Sanusi and Mokheimer 2019) and advanced gas reforming (Zhou et al. 2020). Low-carbon hydrogen could also be produced from coal coupled with CCS (Hu et al. 2020) (Table 6.7). Current estimates are that adding CCS to produce hydrogen from SMR will add on average 50% on the capital cost, 10% to fuel, and 100% to operating costs. For coal gasification, CCS will add 5% to the capital and fuel costs and 130% to operating costs (Staffell et al. 2018; IEA 2019d). Further, biomass gasification could produce renewable hydrogen, and when joined with CCS could provide negative carbon emissions. ‘Green’ hydrogen (Jaszczur et al. 2016) is most often referred to as hydrogen produced from zero-carbon electricity sources such as solar power and wind power (Schmidt et al. 2017) (Table 6.8). Nuclear power could also provide clean hydrogen, via electrolysis or thermochemical water splitting (EERE 2020).

Hydrogen can be both an energy carrier itself, be converted further into other energy carriers (such as synthetic fuels) and be a means of transporting other sources of energy. For example, hydrogen could be transported in its native gaseous form or liquefied. Hydrogen can also be combined with carbon and transported as a synthetic hydrocarbons (Gumber and Gurumoorthy 2018) (IRENA 2019d) as well as be transported via liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or ammonia (IRENA 2019d). For synthetic hydrocarbons such as methane or methanol to be considered zero carbon, the CO2 used to produce them would need to come from the atmosphere either directly through DACCS or indirectly through BECCS (IRENA 2019b). LOHCs are organic substances in liquid or semi-solid states, which store hydrogen based on reversible catalytic hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation of carbon double bounds (Niermann et al. 2019; Rao and Yoon 2020). Hydrogen produced from electrolysis could also be seen as an electricity energy carrier.

wg3_ch06_6.4.5.1_p13,NO_TITLE,"Ammonia is a promising cost-effective hydrogen carrier (Creutzig et al. 2019). Onsite generation of hydrogen for the production of ammonia already occurs today, and the ammonia (NH3) could be subsequently ‘cracked’ (with a 15–25% energy loss) to reproduce hydrogen (Hansgen et al. 2010; Montoya et al. 2015; Bell and Torrente-Murciano 2016). Because the energy density of ammonia is 38% higher than liquid hydrogen (Osman and Sgouridis 2018), it is potentially a suitable energy carrier for long-distance transport and storage (Salmon et al. 2021). Moreover, ammonia is more easily condensable (liquefied at 0.8 MPa, 20°C), which provides economically viable hydrogen storage and supply systems. Ammonia production and transport are also established industrial processes (about 180 MMT yr –1) (Valera-Medina et al. 2017), and hence ammonia is considered to be a scalable and cost-effective hydrogen-based energy carrier. At present, most ammonia is used in fertilisers (about 80%), followed by many industrial processes, such as the manufacturing of mining explosives and petrochemicals (Jiao and Xu 2018). In contrast to hydrogen, ammonia can be used directly as a fuel without any phase change for internal combustion engines, gas turbines, and industrial furnaces (Kobayashi et al. 2019). Ammonia can also be used in low- and high-temperature fuel cells (Lan and Tao 2014), whereby both electricity and hydrogen can be produced without any nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Furthermore, ammonia provides the flexibility to be dehydrogenated for hydrogen-use purposes. Ammonia is considered a carbon-free sustainable fuel for electricity generation, since in a complete combustion, only water and nitrogen are produced (Valera-Medina et al. 2017). Like hydrogen, ammonia could facilitate management of VRE, due to its cost-effective grid-scale energy storage capabilities. In this regard, production of ammonia via hydrogen from low- or zero-carbon generation technologies along with ammonia energy recovery technologies (Afif et al. 2016) could play a major role in forming a hydrogen and/or ammonia economy to support decarbonisation. However, there are serious concerns regarding the ability to safely use ammonia for all these purposes, given its toxicity – whereas hydrogen is not considered toxic."

Relatively high capital costs and large electricity requirements are also challenges for technologies that produce hydrogen energy carriers. Yet, these energy carriers could become economically viable through the availability of low-cost electricity generation and excess of renewable energy production (Daiyan et al. 2020). A key challenge in use of ammonia is related to the significant amount of NOx emissions, which is released from nitrogen and oxygen combustion, and unburned ammonia. Both have substantial air pollution risks, which can result in lung and other injuries, and can reduce visibility (EPA 2001). Due to the low flammability of hydrogen energy carriers such as liquefied hydrogen (Nilsson et al. 2016) and ammonia (Li et al. 2018), a stable combustion (Lamas and Rodriguez 2019; Zengel et al. 2020) in the existing gas turbines is not currently feasible. In recent developments, however, the proportion of hydrogen in gas turbines has been successfully increased, and further development of gas turbines may enable them to operate on 100% hydrogen by 2030 (Pflug et al. 2019)."

A demonstration project is under development exporting liquid hydrogen from Australia to Japan (Yamashita et al. 2019). Hydrogen could also be transported as ammonia by ocean in liquid form. Ammonia is advantageous because it is easier to store than hydrogen (Zamfirescu and Dincer 2008; Soloveichik 2016; Nam et al. 2018). Liquid ammonia requires temperatures below –33°C and is therefore more straightforward and less costly to transport than liquefied hydrogen and even liquefied natural gas (Singh and Sahu 2018). A project exporting ammonia from Saudi Arabia to Japan is under consideration (Nagashima 2018). LOHCs could also be used to transport hydrogen at ambient temperature and pressure. This advantageous property of LOHCs makes them similar to oil products, meaning they can be transported in existing oil infrastructure including oil tankers and tanks (IEA 2019; Niermann et al. 2019).

About three times as much compressed hydrogen by volume is required to supply the same amount of energy as natural gas. Security of supply is therefore more challenging in hydrogen networks than in natural gas networks. Storing hydrogen in pipelines (linepack) would be important to maintaining security of supply (Ameli et al. 2017, 2019). Due to the physics of hydrogen, in most cases exiting gas infrastructure would need to be upgraded to transport hydrogen. Transporting hydrogen in medium- or high-pressure networks most often would require reinforcements in compressor stations and pipeline construction routes (Dohi et al. 2016). There are several recent examples of efforts to transport hydrogen by pipeline. For example, in the Iron Mains Replacement Programme in the UK, the existing low-pressure gas distribution pipes are being converted from iron to plastic (Committee on Climate Change 2018). In the Netherlands, an existing low-pressure 12 km natural gas pipeline has been used for transporting hydrogen (Dohi et al. 2016)."

Through enhanced electricity transmission infrastructure, more wind turbines can be deployed in areas with high wind potential and more solar panels in areas with larger solar irradiation. Increases in electricity transmission and trade can also enhance operational efficiency and reduce or defer the need for investment in peaking plants, storage, or other load management techniques needed to meet security of supply requirements associated with localised use of VRE sources.

wg3_ch06_6.4.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Hydrogen production. Low- or zero-carbon hydrogen can be produced from multiple sources. While there is no consensus on the hydrogen production spectrum, ‘blue’ hydrogen (Goldmann and Dinkelacker 2018) generally refers to hydrogen produced from natural gas combined with CCS through processes such as steam methane reforming (SMR) (Sanusi and Mokheimer 2019) and advanced gas reforming (Zhou et al. 2020). Low-carbon hydrogen could also be produced from coal coupled with CCS (Hu et al. 2020) (Table 6.7). Current estimates are that adding CCS to produce hydrogen from SMR will add on average 50% on the capital cost, 10% to fuel, and 100% to operating costs. For coal gasification, CCS will add 5% to the capital and fuel costs and 130% to operating costs (Staffell et al. 2018; IEA 2019d). Further, biomass gasification could produce renewable hydrogen, and when joined with CCS could provide negative carbon emissions. ‘Green’ hydrogen (Jaszczur et al. 2016) is most often referred to as hydrogen produced from zero-carbon electricity sources such as solar power and wind power (Schmidt et al. 2017) (Table 6.8). Nuclear power could also provide clean hydrogen, via electrolysis or thermochemical water splitting (EERE 2020). Hydrogen can even be produced by pyrolysis of methane (Sánchez-Bastardo et al. 2020) – sometimes called ‘turquoise’ hydrogen, solar thermochemical water splitting, biological hydrogen production (cyanobacteria) (Velazquez Abad and Dodds 2017) – and microbes that use light to make hydrogen (under research) (EIA 2020)."

Hydrogen can be both an energy carrier itself, be converted further into other energy carriers (such as synthetic fuels) and be a means of transporting other sources of energy. For example, hydrogen could be transported in its native gaseous form or liquefied. Hydrogen can also be combined with carbon and transported as a synthetic hydrocarbons (Gumber and Gurumoorthy 2018) (IRENA 2019d) as well as be transported via liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or ammonia (IRENA 2019d). For synthetic hydrocarbons such as methane or methanol to be considered zero carbon, the CO2 used to produce them would need to come from the atmosphere either directly through DACCS or indirectly through BECCS (IRENA 2019b). LOHCs are organic substances in liquid or semi-solid states, which store hydrogen based on reversible catalytic hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation of carbon double bounds (Niermann et al. 2019; Rao and Yoon 2020). Hydrogen produced from electrolysis could also be seen as an electricity energy carrier. This is an example of the PtX processes (Section 6.4.4), entailing the conversion of electricity to other energy carriers for subsequent use."
wg3_ch06_6.4.5.1_p13,NO_TITLE,"Ammonia is a promising cost-effective hydrogen carrier (Creutzig et al. 2019). Onsite generation of hydrogen for the production of ammonia already occurs today, and the ammonia (NH3) could be subsequently ‘cracked’ (with a 15–25% energy loss) to reproduce hydrogen (Hansgen et al. 2010; Montoya et al. 2015; Bell and Torrente-Murciano 2016). Because the energy density of ammonia is 38% higher than liquid hydrogen (Osman and Sgouridis 2018), it is potentially a suitable energy carrier for long-distance transport and storage (Salmon et al. 2021). Moreover, ammonia is more easily condensable (liquefied at 0.8 MPa, 20°C), which provides economically viable hydrogen storage and supply systems. Ammonia production and transport are also established industrial processes (about 180 MMT yr –1) (Valera-Medina et al. 2017), and hence ammonia is considered to be a scalable and cost-effective hydrogen-based energy carrier. At present, most ammonia is used in fertilisers (about 80%), followed by many industrial processes, such as the manufacturing of mining explosives and petrochemicals (Jiao and Xu 2018). In contrast to hydrogen, ammonia can be used directly as a fuel without any phase change for internal combustion engines, gas turbines, and industrial furnaces (Kobayashi et al. 2019). Ammonia can also be used in low- and high-temperature fuel cells (Lan and Tao 2014), whereby both electricity and hydrogen can be produced without any nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Furthermore, ammonia provides the flexibility to be dehydrogenated for hydrogen-use purposes. Ammonia is considered a carbon-free sustainable fuel for electricity generation, since in a complete combustion, only water and nitrogen are produced (Valera-Medina et al. 2017). Like hydrogen, ammonia could facilitate management of VRE, due to its cost-effective grid-scale energy storage capabilities. In this regard, production of ammonia via hydrogen from low- or zero-carbon generation technologies along with ammonia energy recovery technologies (Afif et al. 2016) could play a major role in forming a hydrogen and/or ammonia economy to support decarbonisation. However, there are serious concerns regarding the ability to safely use ammonia for all these purposes, given its toxicity – whereas hydrogen is not considered toxic."
wg3_ch06_6.4.5.1_p14,NO_TITLE,"In general, challenges around hydrogen-based energy carriers – including safety issues around flammability, toxicity, storage, and consumption – require new devices and techniques to facilitate their large-scale use. Relatively high capital costs and large electricity requirements are also challenges for technologies that produce hydrogen energy carriers. Yet, these energy carriers could become economically viable through the availability of low-cost electricity generation and excess of renewable energy production (Daiyan et al. 2020). A key challenge in use of ammonia is related to the significant amount of NOx emissions, which is released from nitrogen and oxygen combustion, and unburned ammonia. Both have substantial air pollution risks, which can result in lung and other injuries, and can reduce visibility (EPA 2001). Due to the low flammability of hydrogen energy carriers such as liquefied hydrogen (Nilsson et al. 2016) and ammonia (Li et al. 2018), a stable combustion (Lamas and Rodriguez 2019; Zengel et al. 2020) in the existing gas turbines is not currently feasible. In recent developments, however, the proportion of hydrogen in gas turbines has been successfully increased, and further development of gas turbines may enable them to operate on 100% hydrogen by 2030 (Pflug et al. 2019)."

Hydrogen produced from renewables or other low-carbon sources in one location could be transported for use elsewhere (Philibert 2017; Ameli et al. 2020). Depending on the distance to the user and specific energy carrier utilised (e.g., gaseous hydrogen or LOHC), various hydrogen transport infrastructures, distribution systems, and storage facilities would be required (Hansen 2020; Schönauer and Glanz 2021) (Figure 6.17)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.5.1_p17,NO_TITLE,"Hydrogen can be liquefied and transported at volume over the ocean without pressurisation. This requires a temperature of –253°C and is therefore energy-intensive and costly (Niermann et al. 2021). Once it reaches its destination, the hydrogen needs to be re-gasified, adding further cost. A demonstration project is under development exporting liquid hydrogen from Australia to Japan (Yamashita et al. 2019). Hydrogen could also be transported as ammonia by ocean in liquid form. Ammonia is advantageous because it is easier to store than hydrogen (Zamfirescu and Dincer 2008; Soloveichik 2016; Nam et al. 2018). Liquid ammonia requires temperatures below –33°C and is therefore more straightforward and less costly to transport than liquefied hydrogen and even liquefied natural gas (Singh and Sahu 2018). A project exporting ammonia from Saudi Arabia to Japan is under consideration (Nagashima 2018). LOHCs could also be used to transport hydrogen at ambient temperature and pressure. This advantageous property of LOHCs makes them similar to oil products, meaning they can be transported in existing oil infrastructure including oil tankers and tanks (IEA 2019; Niermann et al. 2019). A project is under development to export hydrogen from Brunei to Japan using LOHCs (Kurosaki 2018)."
wg3_ch06_6.4.5.1_p18,NO_TITLE,"Intra-regional hydrogen transportation. Within a country or region, hydrogen would likely be pressurised and delivered as compressed gas. About three times as much compressed hydrogen by volume is required to supply the same amount of energy as natural gas. Security of supply is therefore more challenging in hydrogen networks than in natural gas networks. Storing hydrogen in pipelines (linepack) would be important to maintaining security of supply (Ameli et al. 2017, 2019). Due to the physics of hydrogen, in most cases exiting gas infrastructure would need to be upgraded to transport hydrogen. Transporting hydrogen in medium- or high-pressure networks most often would require reinforcements in compressor stations and pipeline construction routes (Dohi et al. 2016). There are several recent examples of efforts to transport hydrogen by pipeline. For example, in the Iron Mains Replacement Programme in the UK, the existing low-pressure gas distribution pipes are being converted from iron to plastic (Committee on Climate Change 2018). In the Netherlands, an existing low-pressure 12 km natural gas pipeline has been used for transporting hydrogen (Dohi et al. 2016)."

There are still many challenges, however, due to salt or hard rock geologies, large size, and minimum pressure requirements of the sites (IEA 2019c). Consequently, alternative carbon-free energy carriers, which store hydrogen, may become more attractive (Lan et al. 2012; Kobayashi et al. 2019)."

The diurnal and seasonal characteristics of different renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower can vary significantly by location. Through enhanced electricity transmission infrastructure, more wind turbines can be deployed in areas with high wind potential and more solar panels in areas with larger solar irradiation. Increases in electricity transmission and trade can also enhance operational efficiency and reduce or defer the need for investment in peaking plants, storage, or other load management techniques needed to meet security of supply requirements associated with localised use of VRE sources. Increased interconnectivity of large-scale grids also allows the aggregation of ‘smart grid’ solutions such as flexible heating and cooling devices for flexible demand in industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors (Hakimi et al. 2020) and EVs (Muratori and Mai 2020; Li et al. 2021). In general, interconnection is more cost-optimal for countries that are geographically close to each other and can benefit from the diversity of their energy mixes and usage (Schlachtberger et al. 2017). Such developments are not without price, however, and among other concerns, raise issues surrounding land use, public acceptance, and resource acquisition for materials necessary for renewable developments (Capellán-Pérez et al. 2017; Vakulchuk et al. 2020)."

HVDC is used with underground cables or long-distance overhead lines (typically voltages between 100–800 kV) (Alassi et al. 2019) where HVAC is infeasible or not economic. A project development agreement, worth approximately USD17 billion, was signed in January 2021 that would connect 10 GW of PVs in the north of Australia via a 4500 km 3 GW HVDC cable to Singapore, suggesting that this would be cost effective (Sun Cable 2021). In September 2019, the Changji-Guquan ±1,100 kV UHVDC transmission project built by State Grid Corporation of China was officially completed and put into operation. The transmission line is able to transmit up to 12 GW over 3341 km (Pei et al. 2020).

While useful in characterising options in broad strokes, it is important to acknowledge and understand several caveats associated with these metrics, particularly when applied globally. They may be constructed with different discount rates; they require information on energy input costs for options that require energy inputs (e.g., fossil electricity generation, biofuels); they depend on local resource availability, for example, solar insolation for solar power, wind classes for wind power, and rainfall and streamflow for hydropower; and actual implementation costs may include additional elements, for example, the costs of managing electricity grids heavily dependent on VRE electricity sources.

Some of the overlap stems from differences in assumptions or regional conditions that apply to all technologies (e.g., variations in assumed discount rates), but the overlap also reflects the fact that low- and zero-carbon electricity generation options are, and will be, less expensive than emitting options in many regions. Future cost projections also illustrate that several technologies are anticipated to experience further cost declines over the coming decades, reinforcing the increasingly competitiveness of low- and zero-carbon electricity.

Assumptions about the displaced option can lead to very different mitigation cost estimates (Table 6.9).

Many of the changes in the climate system will be geographically complex at the regional and local levels. Thus, regionally climate change impacts on electricity generation could be significant. Climate change impacts on bioenergy potentials are more uncertain because of uncertainties associated with the crop response to climate change, future water availability and crop deployment. Climate change can reduce the efficiency of thermal power generation and increase the risk of power plant shutdowns during droughts.

Additionally, increased precipitation intensity results in the silting of the reservoirs or increases the amount of water spilt, resulting in erosion (Schaeffer et al. 2012; IHA 2019).

Only a few studies extend the modelling of climate change impacts on bioenergy to quantify the effect on bioenergy deployment or its implications on the energy system (Calvin et al. 2013, 2019; Kyle et al. 2014; Thornton et al. 2017).

For example, earlier studies found that, without CO2 fertilisation, climate change will reduce global bioenergy potential by about 16%; with CO2 fertilisation, however, climate change increases this potential by 45% (Haberl et al. 2011). However, newer studies in the USA find little effect of CO2 fertilisation on switchgrass yield (Dolan et al. 2020).

Droughts decrease potential cooling water for thermal power plants and increase the probability of water outlet temperatures exceeding regulatory limits, leading to lower production or shutdowns. Thermal power utilisation has been reported to be, on average, 3.8% lower during drought years globally (van Vliet et al. 2016c), and further significant decreases in available thermal power plant capacity due to climate change are projected (Koch et al. 2014; van Vliet et al. 2016b; Yalew et al. 2020).

Closed-circuit cooling is much less sensitive to water temperature than once-through cooling (Bonjean Stanton et al. 2016). Modifying policies and regulation of water and heat emissions from power plants may also be used to mitigate plant reliability problems induced by climate change (Eisenack 2016; Mu et al. 2020), albeit with potential impacts for other water users and ecology.

For example, globally, De Cian and Sue Wing (2019) found a 7–17% increase in energy consumption due to climate change in 2050, with the range depending on the climate change scenario. The overall effects of climate change on building energy consumption are regionally dependent. For example, Zhang et al.

For example, peak energy demand during heatwaves can coincide with reduced transmission and distribution capacity at higher temperatures. In large cities, extreme heat events increase cooling degree days significantly, with the urban heat island effect compounding the impact (Morakinyo et al. 2019). One study found that total electricity consumption at the end of the century in the USA could increase on average by 20% during summer months and decrease on average by 6% in the winter (Ralston Fonseca et al. 2019). While the average increase in consumption is modest, climate change is projected to have severe impacts on the frequency and intensity of peak electricity loads (Auffhammer et al. 2017). Bartos et al. (2016) find that peak per-capita summertime load in the USA may rise by 4.2–15% by mid-century.

More than 4.5 million homes and businesses on the Texas electric grid were left without electricity for days, limiting the ability to heat homes during dangerously low temperatures and leading to food and clean water shortages (Busby et al. 2021). The Texas and other events – for example, Typhoon Haiyan in Southeast Asia in 2013; the Australian bush fires in 2019–2020; forest fires in 2018 in California; water shortages in Cape Town, South Africa in 2018 and the western USA during 2021 – raise the question of whether future low-carbon energy systems will be more or less resilient than those of today."
wg3_ch06_box-6.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Some characteristics of low-carbon energy systems will make them less resilient. Droughts reduce hydroelectric electricity generation (Gleick 2016; van Vliet et al. 2016c); wind farms do not produce electricity in calm conditions or shut down in very strong winds (Petersen and Troen 2012); solar PV generation is reduced by clouds and is less efficient under extreme heat, dust storms, and wildfires (Perry and Troccoli 2015; Jackson and Gunda 2021). In addition, the electrification of heating will increase the weather dependence of electricity consumption (Staffell and Pfenninger 2018; Gea-Bermúdez et al. 2021). Non-renewable generation, for example, from nuclear and fossil power plants, are also vulnerable to high temperatures and droughts as they depend on water for cooling (Cronin et al. 2018; Ahmad 2021)."
wg3_ch06_box-6.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"But some aspects of low-carbon energy systems will make them more resilient. Wind and solar farms are often spread geographically, which reduces the chances of being affected by the same extreme weather event (Perera et al. 2020). The diversification of energy sources, in which each component has different vulnerabilities, increases resilience. Less reliance on thermal electricity generation technologies will reduce the risks of curtailment or efficiency losses from droughts and heat waves (Lohrmann et al. 2019). More generally, increased electricity system integration and flexibility (Section 6.4.3) and weatherisation of generators increases electricity system resilience (Busby et al. 2021; Heffron et al. 2021). Likewise, local district micro-grids with appropriate enabling technologies (e.g., distributed generation, energy storage, greater demand-side participation, electric vehicles) may ensure access to electricity during major long-duration power outage events and radically enhance the resilience of supply of essential demand (Stout et al. 2019)."

Extreme weather and storms threaten the electricity system in different ways, affecting system resilience, reliability, and adequacy (Moreno-Mateos et al. 2020). The implications of climate change for electricity system vulnerability will depend on the degree to which climate change alters the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The complex compounding effects of simultaneous events (e.g., high winds and lightning occurring at the same time) are not well understood."

Hurricane conditions can damage electricity system infrastructures, including utility-scale wind and solar PV plants. Electricity systems may experience high demand when lines are particularly at risk from mechanical failure from wind and storm-related effects. However, except for medium evidence of increases in heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones, there is limited evidence that extreme wind events will increase in frequency or intensity in the future (Kumar et al. 2015; Pryor et al. 2020)."

In rural areas at the local scale, large-scale solar PV farms change the surface characteristics and affect air temperatures (Taha 2013). Measurements in rural Arizona, USA show local night-time temperatures 3°C–4°C warmer at the PV farm than surroundings (Barron-Gafford et al. 2016). In contrast, measurements in urban settings show that solar PV panels on roofs provide a cooling effect (Taha 2013; Ma et al. 2017). On the regional scale, modelling studies suggest cooling in urban areas (0.11–0.53°C) and warming in rural areas (up to 0.27°C) (Millstein and Menon 2011). Global climate model simulations show that solar panels induce regional cooling by converting part of the incoming solar energy to electricity (Hu et al. 2016). However, converting the generated electricity to heat in urban areas increases regional and local temperatures, compensating for the cooling effect."

Data from field campaigns suggest that a ‘suppression of cooling’ can explain the observed warming (Takle et al. 2019). Regional and climate models have been used to describe the interactions between turbines and the atmosphere and find minor impacts (Vautard et al. 2014). More sophisticated models confirm the local warming effect of wind farms but report that the impact on the regional area is slight and occasional (Wang et al. 2019d).

An understanding of these future energy systems can help to chart a course toward them over the coming decades."
wg3_ch06_6.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"This section synthesises current understanding of net-zero energy systems. Discussions surrounding efforts to limit warming are frequently communicated in terms of the point in time at which net anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach zero, accompanied by substantial reductions in non-CO2 emissions (IPCC 2018, Chapter 3). Net-zero GHG goals are also common, and they require net-negative CO2 emissions to compensate for residual non-CO2 emissions. Economy-wide CO2 and GHG goals appear in many government and corporate decarbonisation strategies, and they are used in a variety of ways. Most existing carbon-neutrality commitments from countries and sub-national jurisdictions aim for economies with very low emissions rather than zero emissions. Offsets, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, and/or land sink assumptions are used to achieve net-zero goals (Kelly Levin et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch06_6.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Precisely describing a net-zero energy system is complicated by the fact that different scenarios attribute different future CO2 emissions to the energy system, even under scenarios where economy-wide CO2 emissions reach net zero. It is also complicated by the dependence of energy system configurations on unknown future conditions such as population and economic growth, and technological change. The energy system is not the only source or sink of CO2 emissions. Terrestrial systems may store or emit carbon, and CDR options like BECCS or DACCS can be used to store CO2, relieving pressure on the energy system (Chapter 3). The location of such CDR options is ambiguous, as it might be deployed within or outside of the energy sector (Figure 6.21), and many CDR options, such as DACCS, would be important energy consumers (Bistline and Blanford 2021a) (Section 6.6.2). If CDR methods are deployed outside of the energy system (e.g., net negative agriculture, forestry, and land-use CO2 emissions), it is possible for the energy system to still emit CO2 but have economy-wide emissions of zero or below. When global energy and industrial CO2 emissions reach net zero, the space remaining for fossil energy emissions is determined by deployment of CDR options (Figure 6.21)."

While energy systems may not reach net zero concurrently with economy-wide CO2 or GHG emissions, they are a useful benchmark for planning a path to net zero. Note that the focus here is on energy systems with net-zero CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, but the lessons will be broadly applicable to net-zero GHG energy systems as well. Net-zero GHG energy systems would incorporate the major efforts made to reduce non-CO2 emissions (e.g., CH4 from oil, gas and coal as discussed in Section 6.4) and would also need to incorporate more CDR to compensate for remaining non-CO2GHG emissions. Energy sector emissions in many countries may not reach net zero at the same time as global energy system emissions (Figure 6.25 and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3)."

Reports associated with net-zero economy-wide targets for countries and sub-national entities typically do not provide detailed roadmaps or modelling but discuss high-level guiding principles, though more detailed studies are emerging at national levels (Capros et al. 2019; Wei et al. 2020; Duan et al. 2021; Williams et al. 2021a). Most analysis has focused on identifying potential decarbonisation technologies and pathways for different sectors, enumerating opportunities and barriers for each, their costs, highlighting robust insights, and characterising key uncertainties (Davis et al. 2018; Hepburn et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.6.2_p3,Limited and/or Targeted Use of Fossil Fuels ,"The literature on the configuration of net-zero energy systems is limited in a few respects. On the one hand, there is a robust integrated assessment literature that provides characterisations of these systems in broad strokes (the AR6 database), offering internally consistent global scenarios to link global warming targets to regional/national goals. All integrated assessment scenarios that discuss net-zero energy system CO2 emissions provide high-level characterisations of net-zero systems. Because these characterisations have less temporal, spatial, technological, regulatory, and societal detail, however, they may not consider the complexities that could ultimately influence regional, national, or local pathways. High-fidelity models and analyses are needed to assess the economic and environmental characteristics and the feasibility of many aspects of net-zero or net-negative emissions energy systems ( high confidence) (Blanford et al. 2018; Bistline and Blanford 2020). For example, evaluating the competitiveness of electricity sector technologies requires temporal, spatial, and technological detail to accurately represent system investments and operations (Collins et al. 2017; Santen et al. 2017; Helistoe et al. 2019; Bistline 2021c; Victoria et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch06_6.6.2_p4,Limited and/or Targeted Use of Fossil Fuels ,Configurations of net-zero energy systems will vary by region but are likely to share several common characteristics ( high confidence) (Figure 6.22). We focus on seven of those common characteristics in the remainder of this subsection.
wg3_ch06_6.6.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Net-zero energy systems will use far less fossil fuel than today ( high confidence). The precise quantity of fossil fuels will largely depend on the relative costs of such fuels, electrification, alternative fuels, and CDR (Section 6.6.2.4) in the energy system ( high confidence). All of these are affected by regional differences in resources (McGlade and Ekins 2015), existing energy infrastructure (Tong et al. 2019), demand for energy services, and climate and energy policies. Fossil fuel use may persist, for example, if and where the costs of such fuels and the compensating carbon management (e.g., CDR, CCS) are less than non-fossil energy. For most applications, however, it is likely that electrification (McCollum et al. 2014; Madeddu et al. 2020; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) or use of non-fossil alternative fuels (Zeman and Keith 2008; Graves et al. 2011; Hänggi et al. 2019; Ueckerdt et al. 2021) will prove to be the cheapest options. Most residual demand for fossil fuels is likely to predominantly be petroleum and natural gas given their high energy density (Davis et al. 2018), while demand for coal in net-zero energy systems is likely to be very low (Luderer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020, Section 6.7.4) ( high confidence)."
wg3_ch06_6.6.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is considerable flexibility regarding the overall quantity of liquid and gaseous fuels that will be required in net-zero energy systems ( high confidence) (Figure 6.22 and Section 6.7.4). This will be determined by the relative value of such fuels as compared to systems which rely more or less heavily on zero-emissions electricity. In turn, the share of any fuels that are fossil or fossil-derived is uncertain and will depend on the feasibility of CCS and CDR technologies and long-term sequestration as compared to alternative, carbon-neutral fuels. Moreover, to the extent that physical, biological, and/or socio-political factors limit the availability of CDR (Smith et al. 2015; Field and Mach 2017), carbon management efforts may prioritise residual emissions related to land use and other non-energy sources."
wg3_ch06_6.6.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Net-zero energy systems will rely on decarbonised or net-negative CO2 emissions electricity systems, due to the many lower-cost options for producing zero-carbon electricity and the important role of end-use electrification in decarbonising other sectors ( high confidence)."
wg3_ch06_6.6.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are many possible configurations and technologies for zero- or net-negative-emissions electricity systems ( high confidence). These systems could entail a mix of variable renewables, dispatchable renewables (e.g., biomass, hydropower), other firm, dispatchable (‘on-demand’) low-carbon generation (e.g., nuclear, CCS-equipped capacity), energy storage, transmission, carbon removal options (e.g., BECCS, DACCS), and demand management (Luderer et al. 2017; Bistline et al. 2018; Jenkins et al. 2018b; Bistline and Blanford 2021b). The marginal cost of deploying electricity sector mitigation options increases as electricity emissions approach zero; in addition, the most cost-effective mix of system resources changes as emissions approach zero and, therefore, so do the implications of electricity sector mitigation for sustainability and other societal goals (Mileva et al. 2016; Bistline et al. 2018; Sepulveda et al. 2018; Jayadev et al. 2020; Cole et al. 2021). Key factors influencing the electricity mix include relative costs and system benefits, local resource bases, infrastructure availability, regional integration and trade, co-benefits, societal preferences and other policy priorities, all of which vary by country and region (Section 6.6.4). Many of these factors depend on when the net-zero point is reached (Figure 6.22)."
wg3_ch06_6.6.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Based on their increasing economic competitiveness, VRE technologies, especially wind and solar power, will likely comprise large shares of many regional generation mixes ( high confidence) (Figure 6.22). While wind and solar will likely be prominent electricity resources, this does not imply that 100% renewable energy systems will be pursued under all circumstances, since economic and operational challenges increase nonlinearly as shares approach 100% (Box 6.8) (Frew et al. 2016; Imelda et al. 2018 b; Shaner et al. 2018; Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Cole et al. 2021). Real-world experience planning and operating regional electricity systems with high instantaneous and annual shares of renewable generation is accumulating, but debates continue about how much wind and solar should be included in different systems, and the cost-effectiveness of mechanisms for managing variability (Box 6.8). Either firm, dispatchable generation (including nuclear, CCS-equipped capacity, dispatchable renewables such as geothermal, and fossil units run with low capacity factors and CDR to balance emissions) or seasonal energy storage (alongside other balancing resources discussed in Box 6.8) will be needed to ensure reliability and resource adequacy with high percentages of wind and solar (Jenkins et al. 2018b; Dowling et al. 2020; Denholm et al. 2021) though each option involves uncertainty about costs, timing, and public acceptance (Albertus et al. 2020)."

Fossil fuel use may persist, for example, if and where the costs of such fuels and the compensating carbon management (e.g., CDR, CCS) are less than non-fossil energy.

These systems require decarbonising all electricity, using this zero-carbon electricity broadly, and then utilising zero-carbon energy carriers for all end uses not served by electricity, for example, air travel, long-distance transport, and high-temperature process heat. Broader questions emerge regarding the attractiveness of supplying all energy, and not just electricity, with renewables (Figure 6.22). Integrated assessment and energy systems research suggest large roles for renewables, but energy and electricity shares are far from 100%, even with stringent emissions reductions targets and optimistic assumptions about future cost reductions (Bauer et al. 2018; Bistline et al. 2018; Jenkins et al. 2018b; Huntington et al. 2020) (Section 6.7.1). Scenarios with 100% renewable energy systems are an emerging subset in the decarbonisation literature, especially at regional levels (Hansen et al. 2019; Denholm et al. 2021). Many 100% renewables studies focus more heavily on electrification for decarbonising end uses, and include less biofuels and hydrogen than the broader literature on deep decarbonisation (Bauer et al. 2018 a). These studies typically assume a constrained set of available technologies to demonstrate the technical feasibility of very high renewable systems and do not optimise to find least-cost, technology-neutral decarbonisation pathways, and many 100% renewables studies focus on the electricity sector or a limited number of sectors (Jenkins et al. 2018a; Hansen et al. 2019). In addition to renewables, studies broadly agree that including additional low-carbon options – including not only low-carbon electricity but also targeted use of fossil fuels with and without CCS (Section 6.6.2.1) and alternative fuels for sectors that are difficult to electrify (Section 6.6.2.4) – can lower the cost of decarbonisation, even with very high shares of renewables (Figure 6.22).

At least 30% of the global final energy needs are expected to be served by electricity, with some estimates suggesting upwards of 80% of total energy use being electrified (Figure 6.22, panel c). Increased electrification is especially valuable in net-zero energy systems in tandem with decarbonised electricity generation or net-negative emissions electricity generation (Section 6.5.4.2). Flexible electric loads (electric vehicles, smart appliances) can in turn facilitate incorporation of VRE electricity options, increase system flexibility, and reduce needs for grid storage (Section 6.4.3) (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Lund et al. 2018)."

Similar calculations suggest that synthetic hydrocarbon fuels could currently avoid CO2 emissions at a cost of USD936–1404 tonne –1 (Ueckerdt et al. 2021). However, economies of scale are expected to bring these costs down substantially in the future (IRENA 2020c; Ueckerdt et al. 2021), and R&D efforts are targeting 60–80% reductions in costs (to less than USD2 kg –1 (H2)–1) possibly by use of less mature but promising technologies such as high-temperature electrolysis and thermochemical water splitting (Kuckshinrichs et al. 2017; Pes et al. 2017; Schmidt et al. 2017; Saba et al. 2018; DOE, 2018, 2020b). Technologies capable of producing hydrogen directly from water and sunlight (photoelectrochemical cells or photocatalysts) are also under development, but are at an early stage (Nielander et al. 2015; DOE 2020a). High hydrogen production efficiencies have been demonstrated, but costs, capacity factors, and lifetimes need to be improved in order to make such technologies feasible for net-zero emissions fuel production at scale (McKone et al. 2014; DOE 2020a; Newborough and Cooley 2020)."

At least 30% of the global final energy needs are expected to be served by electricity, with some estimates suggesting upwards of 80% of total energy use being electrified (Figure 6.22, panel c). Increased electrification is especially valuable in net-zero energy systems in tandem with decarbonised electricity generation or net-negative emissions electricity generation (Section 6.5.4.2). Flexible electric loads (electric vehicles, smart appliances) can in turn facilitate incorporation of VRE electricity options, increase system flexibility, and reduce needs for grid storage (Section 6.4.3) (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Lund et al. 2018)."

Process and boiler heating in industrial facilities are anticipated to be electrified in net-zero energy systems. Emissions intensity reductions for cement and concrete production can be achieved through the use of electrified cement kilns, while emissions associated with steel production can be reduced through the use of an electric arc furnace (EAF) powered by decarbonised electricity (Rissman et al. 2020). Electricity can also be used to replace thermalheat such as resistive heating, EAFs, and laser sintering (Madeddu et al. 2020; Rissman et al. 2020).

Hydrogen could provide long-term electricity storage to support high-penetration of intermittent renewables and could enable trading and storage of electricity between different regions to overcome seasonal or production capability differences (Dowling et al. 2020; Sepulveda et al. 2021). It could also be used in lieu of natural gas for peaking generation, provide process heat for industrial needs, or be used in the metal sector via direct reduction of iron ore (Chapter 11). Clean hydrogen could be used as a feedstock in the production of various chemicals and synthetic hydrocarbons. Finally, hydrogen-based fuel cells could power vehicles.

These technological changes, along with decreasing costs of renewable power, are increasing the viability of hydrogen. Other improvements in hydrogen-based technologies are also emerging quickly. Gas turbines now run on blended fuels containing 5–95% hydrogen by volume (GE 2020) and could operate entirely on hydrogen by 2030 (Pflug et al. 2019).

Hydrogen can also be produced through biomass gasification with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), leading to negative carbon emissions (Arnaiz del Pozo et al. 2021).

Transporting hydrogen through existing gas pipelines is generally not feasible without changes to the infrastructure itself (Gumber and Gurumoorthy 2018; Muratori et al. 2018). Existing physical barriers, such as steel embrittlement and degradation of seals, reinforcements in compressor stations, and valves, require retrofitting during the conversion to H2 distribution or new dedicated pipelines to be constructed (Dohi et al. 2016). The capacity to leverage and convert existing gas infrastructure to transport hydrogen will vary regionally, but in many cases could be the most economically viable pathway (Cerniauskas et al. 2020; Brändle et al. 2021; Brooks 2021; Wettengel 2021). Hydrogen could also be transported as liquid gas or as liquid organic hydrogen carriers such as ammonia, for which industry knowledge exists (Demir et al. 2018; Wulf et al. 2018; Hong et al. 2021). Additionally, improvements in fuel cell technologies are needed to make hydrogen-based transport economically viable. There are also safety concerns associated with the flammability (Nilsson et al. 2017) and storage (Andersson and Grönkvist 2019; Caglayan et al. 2019) of hydrogen which will need to be considered."

The feasibility of net-zero energy system configurations could depend on demonstrating cross-sector benefits like balancing VRE sources in the electricity sector, and on offering the flexibility to produce multiple products.

BECCS has value as an electricity generation technology, providing firm, dispatchable power to support electricity grids with large amounts of VRE sources, and reducing the reliance on other means to manage these grids, including electricity storage (Mac Dowell et al. 2017; Bistline and Blanford 2021a). BECCS may also be used to produce liquid fuels or gaseous fuels, including hydrogen (Section 6.4.2.6) (Muratori et al. 2020b).

For this reason, existing studies find that energy efficiency and demand reduction strategies will be important contributors to net-zero energy systems (Creutzig et al. 2018; Davis et al. 2018; DeAngelo et al. 2021).

Broadly, energy-efficient strategies allow for the same level of services or output while using less energy. At the level of the entire economy, measures such as primary or final energy per capita or per GDP are often used as a proxy for energy efficiency; these measures reflect not only efficiency, but also many other factors such as industrial structure, endowed natural resources, consumer preferences, policies, and regulations.

By comparison, final energy consumption would be 550 EJ if current energy consumption per capita continued under a future population of 10 billion people.

Lighter vehicles, a shift to public transit, and incorporation of two- and three-wheelers will be features of a net-zero energy system (Chapter 10).

Integration includes not only the physical energy systems themselves but also simultaneous societal objectives (e.g., sustainable development goals), innovation processes (e.g., coordinating R&D to increase the likelihood of beneficial technological spillovers), and other institutional and infrastructural transformations (Sachs et al. 2019). Given system variability and differences in regional resources, there are economic and technical advantages to greater coordination of investments and policies across jurisdictions, sectors, and levels of government (Schmalensee and Stavins 2017). Coordinated planning and operations can improve system economics by sharing resources, increasing the utilisation of capital-intensive assets, enhancing the geographical diversity of resource bases, and smoothing demand.

The many possible feedstocks, energy carriers, and interconversion processes imply a greater need for the integration of production, transport, storage, and consumption of different fuels (Davis et al. 2018). For instance, electrification is expected to play an important role in decarbonising light-duty vehicles (Chapter 10, Section 6.4.3), yet the electricity and transport sectors have few direct interactions today. Systems integration and sectoral coupling are increasingly relevant to ensure that net-zero energy systems are reliable, resilient, and affordable (EPRI 2017; Martin et al. 2017; Buttler and Spliethoff 2018; O’Malley et al. 2020). Deep decarbonisation offers new opportunities and challenges for integrating different sectors as well as supply- and demand-side options. For instance, increasing electrification will change daily and seasonal load shapes, and end-use flexibilities and constraints could impact the desirability of different supply-side technologies (Brown et al. 2018; EPRI 2019b). The feasibility of net-zero energy system configurations could depend on demonstrating cross-sector benefits like balancing VRE sources in the electricity sector, and on offering the flexibility to produce multiple products. For instance, low-emissions synthetic fuels could help to bridge stationary and mobile applications, since fuel markets have more flexibility than instantaneously balanced electricity markets due to the comparative ease and cost of large-scale, long-term storage of chemical fuels (Davis et al. 2018)."

CDR is not intended as a replacement for emissions reduction, but rather as a complementary effort to offset residual emissions from sectors that are not decarbonised and from other low-carbon technologies such as fossil CCS (McLaren et al. 2019; Gaffney et al. 2020; Iyer et al. 2021)."

As such, it involves institutional changes alongside changes in supply, technology, or markets (Andrews-Speed 2016, Pai et al. 2021). Institutional relationships between governments and energy sector actors (e.g., consumers, electricity companies) affect the nature of net-zero systems, as these entities may collaborate on or dispute net-zero goals and measures to achieve them. For example, following the Fukushima disaster, Japan placed emphasis on government-utility-public cooperation on use of nuclear power as a means of reducing carbon emissions (Sklarew 2018). Institutions are instrumental in shaping net-zero energy systems in multiple ways, complemented by and interacting with the behaviours of actors and policy regimes in these systems (Figure 6.24)."

The institutional environment – the political and legal systems that govern exchanges and protect property rights – would also need to be different in net-zero energy systems. In this setting, changing regulations or subsidies that continue to favour carbon-intensive systems over the technologies of a net-zero energy system might prove difficult (Sovacool 2017). More generally, net-zero energy systems will need new regulatory frameworks to undertake new challenges, from managing a more interconnected grid to adequately governing underground storage of CO2. Institutions may also govern specific transactions, such as firms or networks that supply energy fuels or services. Current actors are typically resistant to disruptions, even if such disruptions may broadly benefit society (Kungl 2015; Schmid et al. 2017; Mori 2018)."

The example shows how decision-making and the infrastructures involved are layered, and can create ‘nested hierarchies’ where institutions fulfil multiple roles for energy governance or regulation simultaneously (Stern et al. 2016b).

The share of low-carbon technologies in global primary energy supply today is below 20% (Chapter 3, Section 6.3, and Figure 6.29). The percentage of low- and zero-carbon energy will depend in part on the evolution of energy demand – the more that energy demand grows, the more energy from low- and zero-carbon sources will be needed, and the higher the percentage of total primary energy these sources will represent."

Decarbonising electricity generation, in tandem with increasing use of electricity (see below), is an essential near-term strategy for limiting warming. The increase in low- and zero-carbon electricity will occur while electricity demand grows substantially. Studies have projected that global electricity demand will roughly double by 2050 and quadruple to quintuple by 2100 irrespective of efforts to reduce emissions (Bauer et al. 2017; Luderer et al. 2017; IEA 2019a)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Renewable energy, especially generation from solar and wind, is likely to have an important role in many low-carbon electricity systems. The contributions of wind and solar electricity will depend on their levelised costs relative to other options, integration costs, system value, and the ability to integrate variable resources into the grid (Section 6.6). Electric sector technology mixes will vary by region but will typically include additional resources  such as hydropower, nuclear power, fossil generation with CCS, energy storage resources, and geothermal energy, among others. Contributions of different options vary widely across scenarios based on different assumptions about these factors (Figure 6.30)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.1.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Nonetheless, it is likely that wind and solar will dominate low-carbon generation and capacity growth over the next couple of decades due to supporting policies in many countries, and due to their significant roles in early electric sector decarbonisation, alongside reductions in coal generation (Bistline and Blanford 2021b; Pan et al. 2021). Clean firm technologies play important roles in providing flexibility and on-demand generation for longer durations, though deployment of these technologies is typically associated with deeper decarbonisation levels (e.g., beyond 70–80% reductions), which are likely to be more important after 2030 in many regions, and with more limited CDR deployment (Baik et al. 2021; Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Williams et al. 2021a)."
wg3_ch06_box-6.11_p1,Technology Options to Offset Residual Emissions ,"There are multiple possible strategies to transform the energy system to reach net-zero CO2 emissions and to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower. All pathways rely on the strategies for net-zero CO2 energy systems highlighted in Section 6.6.2, but they vary in the emphasis that they put on different aspects of these strategies and the pace at which they approach net-zero emissions. The pathway that any country or region might follow will depend on a wide variety of factors (Section 6.6.4), including, for example, resource endowments, trade and integration with other countries and regions, carbon sequestration potential, public acceptability of various technologies, climate, the nature of domestic industries, the degree of urbanisation, and the relationship with other societal priorities such as energy access, energy security, air pollution, and economic competitiveness. The Illustrative Mitigation Pathways presented in this box demonstrate four distinct strategies for energy system transformations and how each plays out for a different region, aligned with global strategies that would limit warming to 2.0°C (>67%) or to 1.5°C (>50%). Each pathway represents a very different vision of a net-zero energy system. Yet, all these pathways share the common characteristic of a dramatic system-wide transformation over the coming decades."

Switching to energy carriers produced from low-carbon sources will be an important strategy for energy sector decarbonisation. Accelerated electrification of end uses such as light duty transport, space heating, and cooking is a critical near-term mitigation strategy (Sugiyama 2012; Zou et al. 2015; Rockström et al. 2017; IEA 2019f; Waisman et al. 2019; B. Tang et al. 2021 ). Electricity supplies 48–58% (interquartile range) of the global final energy demand by 2050 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and 36–47% in scenarios limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) (Figure 6.29). Globally, the current level of electrification is about 20%."

The extent of indirect electrification of final energy will depend on resource endowments and other regionally specific circumstances. Although indirect electrification is less efficient compared to direct electrification, it allows low-carbon fuels to be imported from regions with abundant low-carbon electricity generation resources (Fasihi and Bogdanov 2016; Lehtveer et al. 2019; Fasihi and Breyer 2020) (Box 6.10 on regional integration)."

For these sectors, alternative fuels or energy carriers such as biofuels, hydrogen, ammonia or synthetic methane, may be needed (Section 6.6 and Box 6.9). Most scenarios find that hydrogen consumption will grow gradually, becoming more valuable when the energy system has become predominantly low-carbon (Figure 6.31)."
wg3_ch06_box-6.11_p12,Technology Options to Offset Residual Emissions ,"Reducing energy demand. Energy service demand is expected to continue to increase with growth of the economy, but there is great uncertainty about how much it will increase (Bauer et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2018). Given the need to produce low-carbon energy, the scale of energy demand is a critical determinant of the mitigation challenge (Riahi et al. 2012). Higher energy demand calls for more low-carbon energy and increases the challenge; lower energy demand reduces the need for low-carbon sources and therefore can ease a low-carbon transition. Recent studies have shown that tempering the growth of energy demand, while ensuring services and needs are still satisfied, can materially affect the need for technological CDR (Section 6.7.1.3) (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). Two of the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMP-SP, IMP-LD) feature substantially lower final energy demand across buildings, transport, and industry than most other pathways in the literature. In some cases, energy demand levels are lower in 2050 (and later) than in 2019. These lower demands result in less reliance on bioenergy and a more limited role for CDR (Figure 3.18)."

The Kaya Identity can be used to decompose energy system CO2 emissions into carbon intensity of the energy system (CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and industry divided by energy use), energy intensity (energy use divided by economic output), and economic output. The impacts of energy and climate policy are reflected in the changes of carbon intensity and energy intensity. Carbon intensity captures decarbonisation of energy supply systems, for example, through fuel switching from fossil fuels to non-fossil fuels, upscaling of low-carbon energy sources, and deploying carbon dioxide removal technologies. The carbon intensity of electricity is specifically important, given the role of the electricity sector in near-term mitigation.

One example is the German Energiewende, which includes substantial support for renewables, an action plan for energy efficiency, and phase-out processes for nuclear- and coal-based power generation next to carbon pricing (Löschel et al. 2019). The halving of CO2 emissions in UK power generation reflects multiple policies, particularly within the UK’s Climate Change Act 2008 (Grubb and Newbery 2018).

For example, the interaction between carbon pricing and the support for clean energy technologies in the EU clean low-carbon strategy for 2050 can reduce mitigation costs and allow for the early adoption of more stringent climate targets (Vandyck et al. 2016). Policy efforts to promote adoption of low-carbon technologies are more successful if they focus not only on economic incentives but include behavioural interventions that target relevant cognitive and motivational factors (Mundaca et al. 2019; Khanna et al. 2021) (Section 6.7.6).

Accounting for the different development stages of new technologies will enhance low-emissions transitions (Graaf and Sovacool 2020). For prototype technologies and technologies in the demonstration phase, research subsidies and demonstration projects are most important. For technologies experiencing early adoption, infrastructure development and strengthening of markets are increasingly important, while retiring or repurposing of existing assets is important for mature technologies (IEA 2020h) Effective policy mixes will address different market frictions and deal with various uncertainties, for example, those pertaining to technological, climate, and socio-economic developments (Aldy 2020), but also with respect to outcomes of individual policies (e.g., Borenstein et al. 2019). Therefore, policy mixes may balance the trade-off between stability and the flexibility to change individual policies (Gawel and Lehmann 2019) and the policy mix over time (Rayner et al. 2017). Some policy instruments may become feasible over time, for example, as technological advancements reduce the transaction costs of comprehensive market-based approaches (Andoni et al. 2019; Di Silvestre et al. 2020), or as weakened barriers to stringency enable policy sequencing (Pahle et al. 2018). Energy system policy mixes often include sector-specific regulation. Compared to economy-wide approaches, sectoral policies may be able to directly target specific sectors or mitigation options. However, uncoordinated implementation or limited coordination across sectors may lead to efficiency losses (e.g. Rosendahl et al. 2017). These losses also depend on other policies, such as pre-existing taxes (Goulder et al. 2016; Marten et al. 2018) or research and development policies (Acemoglu et al. 2016). Moreover, unilateral policies – those taken by individual countries in the absence of coordination with other countries – could raise carbon leakage risks, while balancing potential issues of (industrial) competitiveness (Martin et al. 2014; Rosendahl et al. 2017). Energy leakage may become more important during low-carbon energy systems. Numerous studies have identified pathways for carbon leakage in electricity markets with incomplete emission markets (Caron et al. 2015; Murray and Maniloff 2015; Thurber et al. 2015; Duan et al. 2017; Fell and Maniloff 2017; Qian et al. 2018). Well-designed policy mixes will need to target the whole lifecycle or value chains, for example, through policies on limiting fossil fuel extraction (Asheim et al. 2019), or they will need to include measures to limit carbon leakage (e.g. Cosbey et al. 2019)."

Existing policy mixes often reflect different political economy constraints, and sometimes not well coordinated goals. The resulting policy mixes are often economically inefficient.

For example, taking into account country-specific objectives, failures, and limitations, carbon prices may be only one part of a broader policy mix, and thereby may not be uniform across countries (Bataille 2020). This lack of consistency makes it more difficult to assess economic outcomes since costs of complementary policies are often less visible and are often targeted at high-cost mitigation options (Borenstein et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Effective assessment of policy mixes requires comprehensive, validated international data, methodologies, and indicators. Existing policy mixes are difficult to evaluate because they target multiple objectives, and the evaluation must consider various criteria (Chapter 13 and Section 6.7.7), such as environmental and economic effectiveness, distributional effects, transformative potential, institutional requirements, and feasibility. Economic outcomes depend on policy goals and implementation. Existing studies on policy mixes suggest the benefits of a comprehensive approach (Rosenow et al. 2017), while also highlighting that an ‘excessive’ number of instruments may reduce overall effectiveness (Costantini et al. 2017). Combining environmental regulation and innovation policies may be of particular importance to tackle both emissions and innovation market failures (Fabrizi et al. 2018). The consistency and credibility of policy mixes is positively associated with green innovation (Rogge and Schleich 2018)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"Potential future policies are difficult to evaluate due to methodological challenges ( high confidence).

Many assessments of future low-carbon energy transitions are still based on cost-optimal evaluation frameworks and include only limited analysis of interactions between policy measures. Hence they are often not describing real-world energy transitions properly, but rather differences in implied carbon prices, constraints in technology deployment, and timing of policies (Trutnevyte 2016)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.6_p1, Strategies to Encourage Climate Mitigation Actions ,"Members of societies, including individuals, civil society, and businesses, will all need to engage with, and be affected by, low-carbon energy system transitions ( high confidence).

When people face important barriers to change (e.g., high costs, legal barriers), policy would be needed make low-carbon actions more attractive, or to make high-carbon actions less attractive. As people generally face multiple barriers for change, combinations of policies would be more effective (Rosenow et al. 2017)."

In many countries, more residential solar PV were installed after the introduction of favourable financial schemes such as feed-in-tariffs, federal income tax credits, and net metering (Wolske and Stern 2018). Similarly, many programs have promoted the installation of lower-carbon household options such as heat pumps, district heating, or solar water heaters across Europe, the Asia-Pacific and Africa (Hu et al. 2012; Sovacool and Martiskainen 2020; Ahmed et al. 2021). Yet, financial incentives may underperform expectations when other factors are overlooked. For example, people may not respond to financial incentives when they do not trust the organisation sponsoring the programme, or when it takes too much effort to receive the incentive (Mundaca 2007; Stern et al. 2016a). Financial incentives are more effective if combined with strategies addressing non-financial barriers."

Acceptability can increase after a policy or change has been implemented and the consequences appear to be more positive than expected (Schuitema et al. 2010; Eliasson 2014; Weber 2015; Carattini et al. 2018); effective policy trials can thus build public support."

Even in cases when system costs are higher for low-carbon transitions, these transitions may still be economically favourable when accounting for health impacts and other co-benefits (Gielen et al. 2019). Past assessments have quantified the aggregate economic costs for climate change mitigation using different metrics, for example, carbon prices, GDP losses, investments in energy infrastructure, and energy system costs. Assessments of mitigation costs from integrated assessment and energy system models vary widely. For example, scenarios include carbon prices in 2030 of less than USD20 tCO2–1, but also more than USD400 tCO2–1 depending on the region, sector boundary, and methodology (e.g., Bauer et al. 2016; Brouwer et al. 2016; Oshiro et al. 2017; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019).

Given the importance of electricity decarbonisation in near-term mitigation strategies (Section 6.7.1), decreasing costs of solar PV, wind power, and batteries to support their integration, have an outsized influence on near-term economic outcomes from mitigation.

For the whole economy, the interquartile range of estimated mitigation costs is between 140 USD2015 and 340 USD2015 tCO2–1 in 2050 in scenarios limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) and between 430 USD2015 and 990 USD2015 tCO2–1 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (Chapter 3). For energy sectors in various regions and globally, different scenarios show a wide range of implied carbon prices in 2050 to limit warming to 1.5°C, from below USD50 tCO2–1 to more than USD900 tCO2–1 (Brouwer et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Mitigation costs for scenarios limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) were 3–11% in consumption losses in AR5, but the median in newer studies is about 3% in GDP losses (Su et al. 2018; Gambhir et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p5,NO_TITLE,"Estimates of long-run mitigation costs are highly uncertain and depend on various factors. Both faster technological developments and international cooperation are consistently found to improve economic outcomes (Paroussos et al. 2019). Long-term mitigation is likely to be more challenging than near-term mitigation because low-cost opportunities get utilised first and later efforts would require mitigation in more challenging sectors (Section 6.6). Advances in low-carbon energy resources and carriers such as next-generation biofuels, hydrogen produced from electrolysis, synthetic fuels, and carbon-neutral ammonia would substantially improve the economics of net-zero energy systems ( high confidence). Current estimates of cumulative mitigation costs are comparably high for developing countries, amounting to up to 2–3% of GDP, indicating difficulties for mitigation without adequate support from developed countries (Dorband et al. 2019; Fujimori et al. 2020). In scenarios involving large amounts of stranded assets, the overall costs of low-carbon transitions also include the additional costs of early retirements (Box 6.11)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p6,NO_TITLE,"Focusing only on aggregate economic outcomes neglects distributional impacts, impacts on broader SDGs, and other outcomes of broad societal importance. Strategies to increase energy efficiency and energy conservation are, in most instances, mutually reinforcing with strategies to support sustainable development. Improving efficiency and energy conservation will promote sustainable consumption and production of energy and associated materials (SDG 12) ( high confidence). Contrastingly, successful implementation of demand-side options requires sustainable partnerships (SDG 17) between different actors in energy systems, for example, governments, utilities, distributors, and consumers. Many authors have argued that energy efficiency has a large untapped potential in both supply and demand (Lovins 2018; Méjean et al. 2019). For example, improved fossil power plant efficiency has been estimated to lower the costs of CCS from USD80–100 tCO2–1 for a subcritical plant to <USD40 tCO2–1 for a high-efficiency plant (Hu and Zhai 2017; Singh et al. 2017). This could enhance energy access and affordability. Eliminating electricity transmission losses has been estimated to mitigate 500 MtCO2 per year globally (Surana and Jordaan 2019). For several other options, such as methane mitigation from the natural gas sector, the costs of infrastructure refurbishing could be offset with the value of the recovered natural gas (Kang et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p7,NO_TITLE,"Efficient end-use technologies are likely to be particularly cost-effective in developing countries where new infrastructure is rapidly getting built and there is an opportunity to create positive path dependencies (Section 6.7.3). Aside from reducing energy consumption, efficient end-use technologies reduce resource extraction, for example, fossil fuel extraction or mining for materials used in wind turbines or solar PV cells (Luderer et al. 2019). Reduced resource extraction is an important precursor to SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production of minerals. End-use efficiency strategies also reduce the need for, and therefore SDG trade-offs associated with, CDR towards the end of the century and avoid temperature overshoot (van Vuuren et al. 2018). But fully leveraging the demand-side efficiency would entail behavioural changes and thus rely on strong partnerships with communities (SDG 17). For instance, approaches that inform households of the economic value of conservation strategies at home could be particularly useful (Niamir et al. 2018). Improved energy efficiency is interlinked with higher economic growth in Africa (Lin and Abudu 2020; Ohene-Asare et al. 2020). An important distinction here between SDGs focusing on infrastructural and behavioural interventions is the temporal context. Improving building heat systems or the electricity grid with reduced T&D losses would provide climate mitigation with one-time investments and minor maintenance over decades. On the other hand, behavioural changes would be an ongoing process involving sustained, long-term societal interactions."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p8,NO_TITLE,"Increasing electrification will support and reduce the costs of key elements of human development, such as education, health, and employment ( high confidence). Greater access to electricity might offer greater access to irrigation opportunities for agricultural communities (Peters and Sievert 2016) which could have the potential for increasing farmer incomes in support of SDG 1. Coordinated electrification policies also improve enrolment for all forms of education (Kumar and Rauniyar 2018; López-González et al. 2020). Empirical evidence from India suggests that electrification reduced the time for biomass collection, and thus increased the time children have available for schooling (SDGs 4 and 5) (Khandker et al. 2014). Reduced kerosene use in developing countries has improved indoor air quality (SDG 3) (Barron and Torero 2017; Lewis and Severnini 2020). These positive linkages between climate change mitigation and other goals have improved perceptions of solar PV among the public and policymakers. ‘Goodwill’ towards solar PV is the highest among all the major mitigation options considered in this chapter (Section 6.4.2)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p9,NO_TITLE,"Past trends have also indicated that, in some Asian countries, electrification has been obtained at lower income levels as compared to developed countries (Rao and Pachauri 2017), with corresponding impacts for development goals. For example, a human development index (HDI) greater than 0.7 (Figure 6.36) which signifies high development is now possible at close to 30 GJ yr –1 per person. This was attainable only at the energy consumption of 50 GJ yr –1 per person in preceding decades."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p11,NO_TITLE,"Electrification also improves energy efficiency, with corresponding implications for development goals. For example, the availability of electric cooking may reduce the cooking primary energy requirement considerably compared to traditional stoves (Yang and Yang 2018; Batchelor et al. 2019; Khan and Alam 2020) while also promoting improved indoor air quality (SDG 3). Similarly, PV-powered irrigation and water pumping reduces pumping energy demands, which has the added advantage of promoting SDG 6 on clean water (Rathore et al. 2018; Elkadeem et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p12,NO_TITLE,"Phasing out fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon sources is likely to have considerable SDG benefits, particularly if trade-offs such as unemployment to fossil fuel workers are minimised ( high confidence). A phase-out of coal (Box 6.2) will support SDGs 3, 7 and 14, but it is also anticipated to create large job losses if not properly managed. At the same time, there are large potential employment opportunities that may be created in alternative sectors such as renewables and bioenergy for both skilled and unskilled workers. ‘Sustainable transition’ pathways have indicated a complete fossil phase-out which could entail numerous other co-benefits. For instance, fossil fuels are estimated to generate only 2.65 jobs per million USD as compared to projected 7.49 from renewables (Garrett-Peltier 2017). Similar synergies may also emerge for nuclear power in the long term, though the high costs create trade-offs in developing country contexts (Agyekum et al. 2020; Castor et al. 2020). While bioenergy production may create jobs, it may also be problematic for SDG 2 on zero hunger by affecting the supplies and prices of food. Phasing out of fossil fuels will also improve air quality (SDG 3) and premature deaths by reducing PM2.5 emissions, (He et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020c). Energy transitions from fossil fuels to renewables, as well as within fossil fuels (coal to gas switching), are already occurring in some regions, spurred by climate concerns, health concerns, market dynamics, or consumer choice (e.g., in the transport sector)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p13,NO_TITLE,"CDR and CCS can create significant land and water trade-offs ( high confidence). For large-scale CDR and CCS deployment to not conflict with development goals requires efforts to reduce implications on water and food systems. The water impacts of carbon capture are large, but these impacts can be strategically managed (Magneschi et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019a; Realmonte et al. 2019; Giannaris et al. 2020 c). In addition, high-salinity brines are produced from geologic carbon storage, which may be a synergy or trade-off depending on the energy intensity of the treatment process and the reusability of the treated waters (Klapperich et al. 2014; Arena et al. 2017); if the produced brine from geologic formations can be treated via desalination technologies, there is an opportunity to keep the water intensity of electricity as constant (Section 6.4.2.5). Both implications of CCS and CDR are related to SDG 6 on clean water. CDR discussions in the context of energy systems frequently pertains to BECCS which could affect food prices based on land management approaches (Daioglou et al. 2020a). Several CDR processes also require considerable infrastructure refurbishment and electrification to reduce upstream CO2 emissions (Singh and Colosi 2021). Large-scale CDR could also open the potential for low-carbon transport and urban energy (by offsetting emissions in these sectors) use that would create synergies with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Effective siting of CDR infrastructure therefore requires consideration of trade-offs with other priorities. At the same time, several SDG synergies have also been reported to accompany CCS projects, such as with reduced air pollution (SDG 3) (Mikunda et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p14,NO_TITLE,"Greater energy system integration (Sections 6.4.3 and 6.6.2) would enhance energy-SDG synergies while eliminating trade-offs associated with deploying mitigation options ( high confidence). Energy system integration strategies focus on codependence of individual technologies in ways that optimise system performance. Accordingly, they can improve economic outcomes and reduce negative implications for SDGs. For example, VRE electricity options raise intermittency concerns and hydrogen can be expensive due to the costs of electricity. Both are relevant to SDG 7 on affordable and reliable energy access. Routing excess solar generation during daytime for hydrogen production will improve grid stability as lower hydrogen costs (Tarroja et al. 2015). Due to the varying patterns of solar and wind energy, these two energy sources could be operated in tandem, thus reducing the material needs for their construction and for storage, thus promoting SDG 12 on sustainable production (Weitemeyer et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019d). For CCS facilities, co-firing of fossil fuels and biomass could enable a more gradual, near-term low-carbon transition (Lu et al. 2019). This could enable early retirements (associated with SDG 1) while also providing air pollution reductions (associated with SDG 3)."
wg3_ch06_6.7.7_p15,NO_TITLE,"Overall, the scope for positive interactions between low-carbon energy systems and SDGs is considerably larger than the trade-offs (Figure 6.37) (McCollum et al. 2018b).

wg3_ch06_FAQ 6.1 |	Will energy systems that emit little or no CO_p1,NO_TITLE,"Low-carbon energy systems will be similar to those of today in that they will provide many of the same services as today – for example, heating and cooling homes, travelling to work or on vacation, transporting goods and services, and powering manufacturing. But future energy systems may be different in that people may also demand new services that aren’t foreseen today, just as people now use energy for many information technology uses that were not anticipated 50 years ago. More importantly, low-carbon energy systems will be different in the way that energy is produced, transformed, and used to provide these services. In the future, almost all electricity will be produced from sources that emit little or no CO2, such as solar power, wind power, nuclear power, bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal power, or fossil energy in which the CO2 is captured and stored. Electricity, hydrogen, and bioenergy will be used in many situations where fossil fuels are used today, for example, in cars or heating homes. And energy is likely to be used more efficiently than today, for example, through more efficient cars, trucks, and appliances, buildings that use very little energy, and greater use or public transportation. All of these changes may require new policies, institutions, and even new ways for people to live their lives. And fundamental to all of these changes is that low-carbon energy systems will use far less fossil fuel than today."
wg3_ch06_FAQ 6.2 |	Can renewable sources provide all the energy needed for energy systems that emit little or no CO_p1,NO_TITLE,"Renewable energy technologies harness energy from natural sources that are continually replenished, for example, from the sun (solar energy), the wind (wind energy), plants (bioenergy), rainfall (hydropower), or even the ocean. The energy from these sources exceeds the world’s current and future energy needs many times. But that does not mean that renewable sources will provide all energy in future low-carbon energy systems. Some countries have a lot of renewable energy, whereas others do not, and other energy sources, such as nuclear power or fossil energy in which CO2 emissions are captured and stored (carbon dioxide capture and storage, or CCS) can also contribute to low-carbon energy systems. The energy from sources such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower can vary throughout the day or over seasons or years. All low-carbon energy sources have other implications for people and countries, some of which are desirable, for example, reducing air pollution or making it easy to provide electricity in remote locations, and some of which are undesirable, for example decreasing biodiversity or mining of minerals to produce low-emissions technologies. For all of these reasons, it is unlikely that all low-carbon energy systems around the world will rely entirely on renewable energy sources."
wg3_ch06_FAQ 6.3 |	What are the most important steps to decarbonise the energy system?_p1,NO_TITLE,"To create a low-carbon energy system, emissions must be reduced across all parts of the system, and not just one or two. This means, for example, reducing the emissions from producing electricity, driving cars, hauling freight, heating and cooling buildings, powering data centres, and manufacturing goods. There are more opportunities to reduce emissions over the next decade in some sectors compared to others. For example, it is possible to substantially reduce electricity emissions over the next decade by investing in low-carbon electricity sources, while at the same time halting the construction of new coal-fired power plants, retiring existing coal-fired power plants or retrofitting them with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and limiting the construction of new gas-fired power plants. There are also opportunities to increase the number of electric cars, trucks, and other vehicles on the road, or to use electricity rather than natural gas or coal to heat homes. And across the whole energy system, emissions can be reduced by using more efficient technologies. While these and other actions will be critical over the coming decade, it is also important to remember that the low-carbon energy transition needs to extend for many decades into the future to limit warming. This means that it is important now to improve and test options that could be useful later on, for example, producing hydrogen from low-carbon sources or producing bioenergy from crops that require less land than today."
