This potential (32–44 GtCO2-eq) requires implementation of a wide range of mitigation options. Options with mitigation costs lower than USD20 tCO2–1 make up more than half of this potential and are available for all sectors. {12.2, Table 12.3}"
wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p2,NO_TITLE,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a necessary element to achieve net zero CO2and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both globally and nationally, counterbalancing residual emissions from hard-to-transition sectors. It is a key element in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 (robust evidence, high agreement). Implementation strategies need to reflect that CDR methods differ in terms of removal process, timescale of carbon storage, technological maturity, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, adverse side effects, and governance requirements. All Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) use land-based biological CDR (primarily afforestation/reforestation (A/R)) and/or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and some include direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). As a median value (5–95% range) across the scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, cumulative volumes of BECCS, CO2 removal from AFOLU (mainly A/R), and DACCS reach 328 (168–763) gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2), 252 (20–418) GtCO2, and 29 (0–339) GtCO2 for the 2020–2100 period, with annual volumes at 2.75 (0.52–9.45) GtCO2 yr –1 for BECCS, 2.98 (0.23–6.38) GtCO2 yr –1 for the CO2 removal from AFOLU (mainly A/R), and 0.02 (0–1.74) GtCO2 yr –1 for DACCS, in 2050. {12.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}"
wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p3,NO_TITLE,"Despite limitedcurrent deployment, moderate to large future mitigation potentials are estimated for direct air carbon capture and sequestration (DACCS), enhanced weathering (EW) and ocean-based CDR methods (including ocean alkalinity enhancement and ocean fertilisation) (medium evidence, medium agreement). The potential for DACCS (5–40 GtCO2 yr –1) is limited mainly by requirements for low-carbon energy and by cost (USD100–300 (full range: USD84–386) tCO2–1). DACCS is currently at a medium technology readiness level. EW has the potential to remove 2–4 (full range: <1 to about 100) GtCO2 yr –1, at costs ranging from USD50 to 200 (full range: USD24–578) tCO2–1. Ocean-based methods have a combined potential to remove 1–100 GtCO2 yr –1 at costs of USD40–500 tCO2–1, but their feasibility is uncertain due to possible side effects on the marine environment. EW and ocean-based methods are currently at a low technology readiness level. {12.3}"
wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p4,NO_TITLE,"Realising the full mitigation potential from the food system requires change at all stages from producer to consumer and waste management, which can be facilitated through integrated policy packages (robust evidence, high agreement).  Some 23–42% of global GHG emissions are associated with food systems, while there is still widespread food insecurity and malnutrition. Absolute GHG emissions from food systems increased from 14 to 17 GtCO2-eq yr –1 in the period 1990–2018. Both supply and demand-side measures are important to reduce the GHG intensity of food systems. Integrated food policy packages based on a combination of market-based, administrative, informative, and behavioural policies can reduce cost compared to uncoordinated interventions, address multiple sustainability goals, and increase acceptance across stakeholders and civil society (limited evidence, medium agreement ). {7.2, 7.4, 12.4}"
wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p5,NO_TITLE,"Diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower GHG emissions (robust evidence, high agreement). Ruminant meat shows the highest GHG intensity. Beef from dairy systems has lower emissions intensity than beef from beef herds (8–23 and 17–94 kgCO2-eq per 100 g protein, respectively) when a share of emissions is allocated to dairy products. The wide variation in emissions reflects differences in production systems, which range from intensive feedlots with stock raised largely on grains through to rangeland and transhumance production systems. Where appropriate, a shift to diets with a higher share of plant protein, moderate intake of animal-source foods and reduced intake of added sugars, salt and saturated fats could lead to substantial decreases in GHG emissions. Benefits would also include reduced land occupation and nutrient losses to the surrounding environment, while at the same time  providing health benefits and reducing mortality from diet-related non-communicable diseases. {7.4.5, 12.4}"
wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p6,NO_TITLE,"Emerging food technologies such as cellular fermentation, cultured meat, plant-based alternatives to animal-based food products, and controlled-environment agriculture, can bring substantial reductions in direct GHG emissions from food production (limited evidence, high agreement). These technologies have lower land, water, and nutrient footprints, and address concerns over animal welfare. Access to low-carbon energy is needed to realise the full mitigation potential, as some emerging technologies are relatively more energy intensive. This also holds for deployment of cold chain and packaging technologies, which can help reduce food loss and waste, but increase energy and materials use in the food system.

Bioenergy is the most land intensive renewable energy option, but the total land occupation of other renewable energy options can become significant in high deployment scenarios (robust evidence, high agreement). Growing demands for food, feed, biomaterials, and non-fossil fuels increase the competition for land and biomass while climate change creates additional stresses on land, exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure, and food systems. Appropriate integration of bioenergy and other bio-based systems, and of other mitigation options, with existing land and biomass uses can improve resource use efficiency, mitigate pressures on natural ecosystems and support adaptation through measures to combat land degradation, enhance food security, and improve resilience through maintenance of the productivity of the land resource base (medium evidence,  high agreement ). {3.2.5, 3.4.6, 12.5}"

wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p9,NO_TITLE,"Coordinated, cross-sectoral approaches to climate change mitigation should be adopted to target synergies and minimise trade-offs between sectors and with respect to sustainable development (robust evidence, high agreement). This requires integrated planning using multiple-objective-multiple-impact policy frameworks. Strong interdependencies and cross-sectoral linkages create both opportunities for synergies and the need to address trade-offs related to mitigation options and technologies. This can only be done if coordinated sectoral approaches to climate change mitigation policies that mainstream these interactions are adopted . Integrated planning and cross-sectoral alignment of climate change policies are particularly evident in developing countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledged under the Paris Agreement, where key priority sectors such as agriculture and energy are closely aligned between the proposed mitigation and adaptation actions in the context of sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {12.6.2}"

Carbon leakage occurs when mitigation measures implemented in one country/sector lead to increased emissions in other countries/sectors. Global commodity value chains and associated international transport are important mechanisms of carbon leakage. Reducing emissions from the value chain and transportation can offer opportunities to mitigate three elements of cross-sectoral spillovers and related leakage: (i) domestic cross-sectoral spillovers within the same country; (ii) international spillovers within a single sector resulting from substitution of domestic production of carbon-intensive goods with their imports from abroad; and (iii) international cross-sectoral spillovers among sectors in different countries . {12.6.3}"

For example, CDR options can have positive impacts on ecosystem services and the SDGs, but also potential adverse side effects; transforming food systems has potential co-benefits for several SDGs, but also trade-offs; and land-based mitigation measures may have multiple co-benefits but may also be associated with trade-offs among environmental, social, and economic objectives. Therefore, the possible implementation of the different sectoral mitigation options would depend on how societies prioritise mitigation versus other products and services, including food, material well-being, nature conservation and biodiversity protection, as well as on other considerations such as society’s future dependence on CDR and on carbon-based energy and materials. {12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6.1}"
wg3_ch12_executive-summary_p13,NO_TITLE,"Governance of CDR, food systems and land-based mitigation can support effective and equitable policy implementation (medium evidence, high agreement). Effectively responding to climate change while advancing sustainable development will require coordinated efforts among a diverse set of state- and non-state-actors on global, multinational, national, and sub-national levels. Governance arrangements in public policy domains that cut through traditional sectors are confronted with specific challenges, such as establishing reliable systems for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) that allow evaluation of mitigation outcomes and co-benefits. Effectively integrating CDR into mitigation portfolios can build on already existing rules, procedures and instruments for emissions abatement. Additionally, to accelerate research, development, and demonstration, and to incentivise CDR deployment, a political commitment to formal integration into existing climate policy frameworks is required, including reliable MRV of carbon flows. Food systems governance may be pioneered through local food policy initiatives complemented by national and international initiatives, but governance on the national level tends to be fragmented, and thus have limited capacity to address structural issues like inequities in access. The governance of land-based mitigation, including land-based CDR, can draw on lessons from previous experience with regulating biofuels and forest carbon; however, integrating these insights requires governance that goes beyond project-level approaches and emphasises integrated land use-planning and management within the frame of the SDGs. {7.4, Box 7.2, 7.6, 12.3.3, 12.4, 12.5}"
wg3_ch12_12.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The scope of this chapter was motivated by the need for a succinct bottom-up cross-sectoral view of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation coupled with the desire to provide systemic perspectives on critical mitigation potentials and options that go beyond individual sectors and cover cross-sectoral topics such as food systems, land systems, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. Driven by this motivation, Chapter 12 provides a focused thematic assessment of CDR methods and food systems, followed by consideration of land-related impacts of mitigation options (land-based CDR and other mitigation options that occupy land) and other cross-sectoral impacts of mitigation, with emphasis on synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options, and between mitigation and other environmental and socio-economic objectives. The systems focus is unique to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC and is of critical policy relevance as it informs coordinated approaches to planning interventions that deliver multiple benefits and minimise trade-offs, and coordinated policy approaches to support such planning, to tap relatively under-explored areas for the strengthening and acceleration of mitigation efforts in the short to medium term, and for dealing with residual emissions in hard-to-transition sectors in the medium to long term."

While some cross-sector technologies are covered in more detail in sectoral chapters, this chapter covers important cross-sectoral linkages and provides synthesis concerning costs and potentials of mitigation options, and co-benefits and trade-offs that can be associated with deployment of mitigation options. Additionally, Chapter 12 covers CDR methods and specific considerations related to land use and food systems, complementing Chapter 7.

wg3_ch12_12.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In the context of cross-sectoral synergies and trade-offs, the chapter identifies a number of mitigation measures that have application in more than one sector. Examples include measures involving product and material circularity, which contribute to mitigation of GHG emissions in a number of ways, such as treatment of organic waste to reduce methane emissions, avoid emissions through generation of renewable energy, and reduce emissions through substitution of synthetic fertilisers. Low-carbon energy technologies such as solar and wind may be used for grid electricity supply, as embedded generation in the buildings sector (e.g., rooftop solar) and for energy supply in the agriculture sector. Nuclear and bio-based thermal electric generation can provide multiple synergies including base load to augment solar and wind, district heating, and seawater desalination. Grid-integrated hydrogen systems can buffer variability of solar and wind power and are being explored as a mitigation option in the transport and industry sectors. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has potential application in a number of industrial processes (cement, iron and steel, petroleum refining and pulp and paper) and the fossil fuel electricity sector. When coupled with energy recovery from biomass (BECCS), CCS can help to provide CO2 removal from the atmosphere. On the demand side, electric vehicles are also considered an option for balancing variable power, energy efficiency options find application across the sectors, as does reducing demand for goods and services, and improving material use efficiency. Focused inquiry into these areas of cross-sectoral perspectives is provided for CDR, food systems, and land-based mitigation options."
wg3_ch12_12.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"A range of examples of where mitigation measures result in cross-sectoral interactions and integration is identified. The mitigation potential of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, is linked to the extent of decarbonisation of the electricity grid, as well as to the liquid fuel supply emissions profile. Making buildings energy positive, where excess energy is used to charge vehicles, can increase the potential of electric and hybrid vehicles. Advanced process control and process optimisation in industry can reduce energy demand and material inputs, which in turn can reduce emissions linked to resource extraction and manufacturing. Trees and green roofs planted to counter urban heat islands reduce the demand for energy for air conditioning and simultaneously sequester carbon. Material and product circularity contributes to mitigation, such as treatment of organic waste to reduce methane emissions, generate renewable energy, and to substitute for synthetic fertilisers."

This overview provides policymakers with an understanding of which options are more or less important in terms of mitigating emissions in the short term (here interpreted as 2030), and which ones are more or less costly. The intention is not to provide a high level of accuracy for each technology cost or potential, but rather to indicate relative importance on a global scale and whether costs are low, intermediate or high. The section starts with an introduction (Section 12.2.1), providing definitions and the background. Next, ranges of net emission reduction potentials and the associated costs for the year 2030 are presented (Section 12.2.2) and compared to earlier estimates and with the outputs of IAMs (Section 12.2.3). Finally, an outlook to the year 2050 is provided (Section 12.2.4)."
wg3_ch12_12.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The term ‘mitigation potential’ is used here to report the quantity of net greenhouse gas emissions reductions that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a specified reference scenario. The net greenhouse gas emission reduction is the sum of reduced emissions and enhanced sinks. Several types of potential can be distinguished. The technical potential is the mitigation potential constrained by theoretical limits in addition to the availability of technology and practices. Quantification of technical potentials primarily takes into account technical considerations, but social, economic and/or environmental considerations are sometimes also considered, if these represent strong barriers to the deployment of an option. The economic potential, being the potential reported in this section, is the proportion of the technical potential for which the social benefits exceed the social costs, taking into account a social discount rate and the value of externalities (see Annex I: Glossary). In this section, only externalities related to greenhouse gas emissions are taken into account. They are represented by using different cost cut-off levels of options in terms of USD per tonne of avoided CO2-eq emissions. Other potentials, such as market potentials, could also be considered, but they are not included in this section."
wg3_ch12_12.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The analysis presented here is based, as far as possible, on information contained in Chapters 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11, where costs and potentials, referred to here as ‘sectoral mitigation potentials’ have been discussed for each individual sector. In the past, these were designated as bottom-up potentials, in contrast to the top-down potentials that are obtained from integrated energy-economic models and IAMs. However, IAMs increasingly include ‘bottom-up’ elements, which makes the distinction less clear. Still, sectoral studies often have more technical and economic detail than IAMs. They may also provide more up-to-date information on technology options and associated costs. However, aggregation of results from sectoral studies is more complex, and although interactions and overlap are corrected for as far as possible in this analysis, it is recognised that such systemic effects are much more rigorously taken into account in IAMs. A comparison is made between the sectoral results and the outcomes of the IAMs in Section 12.2.3."
wg3_ch12_12.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Costs of mitigation options will change over time. For many technologies, costs will reduce as a result of technological learning. An attempt has been made to take into account the average, implementation-weighted costs until 2030. However, the underlying literature did not always allow such costs to be presented. For the year 2030, the results are presented similarly to AR4, with a breakdown of the potential in ‘cost bins’. For the year 2050, a more qualitative approach is provided. The origins of the cost data in this section are mostly based on studies carried out in the period 2015–2020. Given the wide range of the cost bins that are used in this section it is not meaningful (and often not possible) to convert to USD values for one specific year. This may lead to some extra uncertainty, but this is expected to be relatively small."
wg3_ch12_12.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"As indicated previously, net emission reduction potentials are presented based on comparison with a reference scenario. Unfortunately, not all costs and potentials found in the literature are determined against the same reference scenarios. In this assessment, reference scenarios are based on what were assumed current-policy scenarios in the period 2015–2019. Typical reference scenarios are the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP2) scenarios (Fricko et al. 2017) and the Current Policies scenario from the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2019 (IEA 2019). They can both be considered scenarios with middle-of-the-road expectations on population growth and economic development, but there are still some differences between the two (Table 12.2). The net emissions reduction potentials reported here were generally based on analyses carried out before 2020, so the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was not taken into account. For comparison, the Stated Policies scenario of the World Energy Outlook 2020 (IEA 2020a) is also shown, one of the scenarios in which the impact of COVID-19 was considered. Variations of up to 10% between the different reference scenarios exist with respect to macro-variables such as total primary energy use and total GHG emissions. The potential estimates presented below should be interpreted against this background. The total emissions under the reference scenarios in 2030 are expected to be in the range of 54 to 68 GtCO2-eq yr –1 with a median of 60 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (Table 4.1)."

For the AFOLU sector, the potentials were derived from a variety of studies. It may be expected that the best estimates, as averages, match with the reference in a middle-of-the-road scenario. For the buildings sector, the Current Policies scenario of World Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA 2019) was used as a reference. For the transport sector, the references of the underlying sources were used.

Only monetary costs and benefits of options are taken into account. Negative costs occur when the benefits are higher than the costs. For wind energy, for example, this is the case if production costs are lower than those of the fossil alternatives. Ranges are indicated for each option separately, or indicated for the sector as a whole (see Notes column); they reflect full ranges. Cost ranges are not cumulative, e.g., to obtain the full potential below USD50 tCO2-eq –1, the potentials in the cost bins <USD0, USD0–20 and USD20–50 tCO2-eq –1 need to be summed together."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Firstly, a brief overview of the process of data collection is presented, with a more detailed overview being found in Supplementary Material 12.SM.1.2. For the energy sector, the starting point for the determination of the emissions reduction potentials was the Emissions Gap Report (UNEP 2017), but new literature was also assessed, and a few studies that provide updated estimates of the mitigation potentials were included. It was found that higher mitigation potentials than in the UNEP report are now reported for solar and wind energy, but at the same time electricity production by solar and wind energy in the reference scenario has increased, compared to earlier versions of the World Energy Outlook. The net effect is a modest increase in the average value of the potential, and a wider uncertainty range. Costs of electricity-generating technologies are discussed in Section 6.4.7, with a summary of LCOEs from the literature being presented in Section 6.4.7. Mitigation costs of electricity production technology depend on local conditions and on the baseline technology being displaced, and it is difficult to determine the distribution over the cost ranges used in this assessment. However, it is possible to indicate a broad cost range for these technologies. These cost ranges are presented in Table 12.3. For onshore wind and utility-scale solar energy, there is strong evidence that despite regional differences in resource potential and cost, a large part of the mitigation potential can be found in the negative cost category or at cost parity with fossil fuel-based options. This is also the case for nuclear energy in some regions. Other technologies show mostly positive mitigation costs, the highest mitigation costs are for CCS and bioelectricity with CCS, for details see Supplementary Material 12.SM.1.2."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"For the AFOLU sector, assessments of global net emissions reduction studies were provided in Table 7.3. The number of studies depends on the type of mitigation action, but ranges from five to nine. Each of these studies relies on a much larger number of underlying data sources. From these studies, emissions reduction ranges and best estimates were derived. The studies presented refer to different years in the period 2020 to 2050, and the mitigation potential presented for AFOLU primarily refers to the average over the period 2020 to 2050. However, because most of the activities involve storage of carbon in stocks that accumulate carbon, or conversely decay over time (e.g., forests, mangroves, peatland soils, agricultural soils, wood products), the 2020 to 2050 average provides a good approximation of the amount of permanent atmospheric CO2 mitigation that could be available at a given price in 2030. The exception is BECCS, which is in an early upscaling phase, so the potential estimated by Chapter 7 as an average for the 2020 to 2050 period is not included in Table 12.3. Note that for the energy sector a mitigation potential for BECCS is provided in Table 12.3."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"The emissions reduction potentials for the buildings sector were based on the analysis by Chapter 9 authors of a large number of sectoral studies for individual countries or regions. In total, the chapter analysed the results of 67 studies that assess the potential of technological energy efficiency and onsite renewable energy production and use, and the results of 11 studies that assess the potential of sufficiency measures helping avoid demand for energy and materials. The sufficiency measures were included in models by reorganisation of human activities; efficient design, planning, and use of building space; higher density of building and settlement inhabitancy; redefining and downsizing goods and equipment, limiting their use to health, living, and working standards, and their sharing. Most of these studies targeted 2050 for the decarbonisation of buildings; the potentials in 2030 reported here rely on the estimates for 2030 provided by these studies or on the interpolated estimates targeting these 2050 figures. Based on these individual country studies, regional aggregate emissions reduction percentages were found. The potential estimates were assembled in the order sufficiency, efficiency, renewable options, correcting the amount of the potential at each step for the interaction with preceding measures. Note that the option ‘Enhanced use of wood products’ was analysed by Chapter 7, but is listed under the buildings sector in Table 12.3, as such enhanced use of wood takes place predominantly in the construction sector."

For the other transportation modes, additional sources were used to achieve a complete overview of emissions reduction potentials (for further details, see Supplementary Material 12.SM.1.2). A limited number of estimates for global emissions reduction potential is available: the total number of sources is about 10, and some estimates rely on just one source. The data have been coordinated with Chapter 10 authors."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"For the industrial sector, global emissions reduction potentials per technology class per sector were derived by Chapter 11 authors, using primarily sectoral or technology-oriented literature.

wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"For methane emissions reduction from oil and gas operations, coal mining, waste treatment and wastewater, an analysis was done, based on three major data sources in this area (Harmsen et al. 2019; US EPA 2019; Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020); for oil and gas operations this was complemented by IEA (2021a). A similar analysis for reductions of emissions of fluorinated gases was carried out based on analysis by the same institutes (Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson 2017; Harmsen et al. 2019; US EPA 2019).

wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"For all options, uncertainty ranges of the mitigation potentials are given in Table 12.3. As far as possible, the ranges represent the variation in assessments found in the literature. This is the case for wind and solar energy, for the AFOLU options, for the methane mitigation options (coal, oil and gas, waste and wastewater) and for fluorinated gas mitigation. For the latter options, some variability exists for each cost bin, but aggregated over cost ranges the variation is much smaller, typically ±50%. For the buildings sector and the industrial sector options, the uncertainty in the mitigation potential is estimated by the lead authors of those chapters. For options for which only limited sources were available, an uncertainty range of ±50% was used. Overall, the uncertainty range per option is typically in the range of ±20% to ±60%."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"Despite these uncertainties, clearly a number of options with high potentials can be identified, including solar energy, wind energy, reducing conversion of forests and other natural ecosystems, and restoration of forests and other natural ecosystems. As mid-range values, they each represent 4 to 7% of total reference emissions for 2030. Soil carbon sequestration in agriculture and fuel switching in industry can also be considered as options with high potential, although it should be noted that these options consist of a number of discernible sub-options, see Table 12.3. It can be observed that for each sector, a variety of options is available. Many of the smaller options each make up 1 to 2% of the reference emissions for 2030. Within this group of smaller options there are some categories that, summed together, stand out as substantial: the energy efficiency options and the methane mitigations options."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p16,NO_TITLE,"Costs are highly variable across the options. All sectors have several options for which at least part of the potential has mitigation costs below USD20 tCO2–1. The only exception is the industrial sector, in which only energy efficiency is available below this cost level. At the same time, a substantial part of the emissions reduction potential comes at higher cost, much being in the USD20 to 100 tCO2–1 cost ranges. All sectors have substantial additional potential in these cost ranges; only for transportation is this limited. Aggregation of the potentials per cost bin shows that the potential in these cost bins is marginally smaller than in the two cheapest cost bins. For some options, potential was identified in the 100 to 200 tCO2–1 cost bin. The mitigation potentials identified in this cost range make up only a small part of the total mitigation potential. It could be that there is limited potential in this range; however, a more plausible explanation, supported by several authors of sectoral chapters, is that this cost range is relatively unexplored."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p17,NO_TITLE,"In this assessment, the emphasis is on the specific mitigation costs of the various options, and these are often considered as an indicator to prioritise options. However, in such a prioritisation, other elements will also play a role, like the development of technology for the longer term (Section 12.2.4) and the need to optimise investments over longer time periods, see for example Vogt-Schilb et al. (2018) who argue that sometimes it makes sense to start with implementing the most expensive option."
wg3_ch12_12.2.2_p18,NO_TITLE,"In this section, an overview of emissions mitigation options for the year 2030 was presented. The overview of the mitigation potential is based on a variety of approaches, relying on a large number of sources, and the number of sources varied strongly from sector to sector. The main conclusions from this section are: (i) there is a variety of options per sector, (ii) per sector the options combined show significant mitigation potential, (iii) there are a few major options and a lot of smaller ones, and (iv) more than half of the potential comes at costs below USD20 tCO2–1 (between sectors: medium to robust evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"In this section, the mitigation potentials are aggregated per sector, and then to the global economy. These potentials, which are based on sectoral analysis, are then compared to the results from earlier assessments and the results from IAMs. Given the incompleteness of data on the mitigation potential at mitigation costs larger than USD100 tCO2–1, the focus will be on options with mitigation costs below USD100 tCO2–1."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"As suggested previously, the overview presented in Table 12.3 should be interpreted with care, as the implementation of one option may affect the mitigation potential of another option. Most sectoral chapters have supplied mitigation potentials that were already adjusted for overlap and mutual influences (industry, buildings, AFOLU). For the energy sector, interactions between the options will occur, but parallel implementation of all the options seems to be possible; if all options at costs levels below USD100 tCO2–1 were implemented, this would lead to an additional power generation with no direct CO2 emissions of 41% of the total projected generation in 2030. This seems to be possible, but as higher penetrations are relatively unexplored, we apply a smaller uncertainty range at the high end. For the calculation of the aggregate potentials in the energy sector, error propagation rules were applied. For the transport sector, there will be interaction between the technical measures on the one hand and the modal shift measures on the other hand. Given the small mitigation contribution of the modal shift options, these interactions will be negligible. The resulting aggregate mitigation potentials and their uncertainty ranges per (sub)sector are given in Table 12.4 (columns indicated ‘AR6’). This overview confirms the large potentials per sector, even when taking the uncertainty ranges into account."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Calculating aggregated mitigation potentials for the global economy requires that interactions between sectors also need to be taken into account (Section 12.6). First of all, there may be overlap between the electricity supply sector and the electricity demand sectors: if the electricity sector is extensively decarbonised, the avoided emissions due to electricity efficiency measures and local electricity production will be significantly reduced. Therefore, this demand-side mitigation potential is only taken into account for 25% (reflecting the degree of further decarbonisation of the power sector) in the cross-sectoral aggregation. For the other demand sectors, this problem does not arise. The industry sector did not provide estimates for electricity efficiency improvement and in the transport sector the utilisation of electricity to date is very low. Electrification options may occur in all sectors, but this enhances the mitigation potential in combination with a decreased carbon intensity of the power sector. For other energy sector options, such as methane emissions reduction from coal, oil and natural gas operations, the situation is more complex. The total emissions reduction potential for fossil fuels in the other sectors is high. Should this potential be realised, this would lead to a reduction of the potential reported here. However, reducing fossil fuel use also leads to a reduction in the upstream CH4 (methane) emissions, so in the case of reducing fossil fuel use, these upstream emissions will also be avoided, so no overestimate of the aggregate emissions reduction potential occurs."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The total potential, given these corrections for overlap, leads to a mid-range value for the total mitigation potential at costs below USD100 tCO2-eq –1 of 38 GtCO2-eq. Given the fact that it is not to be expected that mitigation potentials of the various sectors are mutually correlated, that is, it is not to be expected that mitigation potentials are all on the high side or all on the low side, the ranges are aggregated using error propagation rules, which leads to a range for the mitigation potential of 32 to 44 GtCO2-eq."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Mitigation costs and potentials for 2030 have been presented previously, notably in AR4 Chapter 11 on Mitigation from a Cross-sectoral Perspective (Barker et al. 2007) and the Emissions Gap Report (UNEP 2017). Note that AR5 did not provide emissions reduction potentials in this form. The aggregated potentials reported here are higher than those estimated in AR4. Note, however, that AR4 suggested the potentials were underestimated by 10 to 15%, but a higher potential still remains in the current assessment. In a sector-by-sector comparison, higher potentials than in AR4 can be observed especially for the energy sector and the forestry sector, and to a more limited extent for the industry sector and the transport sector. For the energy sector, the change can largely be explained by the higher estimates for wind and solar energy and the improved understanding of how to integrate high shares of intermittent renewable energy sources into power systems. For industry and transport, the higher potentials can be partly explained by the inclusion of more options, like recycling and material efficiency (for industry) and electric transportation and modal shifts for transport. For buildings, a lower potential can be observed compared to AR4, one reason is that the 2030 reference direct and indirect emissions were estimated as 45% and 11% higher in AR4 than they were in AR6 (signalling a much quicker actual switch to electricity than was thought 15 to 20 years ago, among other reasons). The other reason for a difference is that the scenarios considered in AR4 had 25 to 30 years between their start year until the target year of 2030 and the scenarios reviewed in AR6 have only 10 to 15 years before 2030. The current retrofitting rates of existing buildings and penetration rates of nearly zero-energy buildings do not allow for decarbonisation of the sector over 10 to 15 years, but they do over a longer time period. A much larger potential than reported here for 2030 can still be realised in the timeframe up to 2050 (Section 9.6.2)."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Another global analysis was done by McKinsey (2009), which presents a marginal abatement cost curve for 2030, suggesting a total potential of 38 GtCO2-eq (note that the reference for that study is 70 GtCO2-eq, which is at the high end of the reference range used in this assessment)."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"The potentials reported here are comparable with UNEP (2017). Note that material for the energy sector from the UNEP report was partly reused in this analysis. Furthermore, some options for the transport sector (aviation and biofuels) were identical to the estimates in the UNEP report. The remaining mitigation potentials are all based on new – and much more extended – assessment. There are some notable changes. The AR6 mitigation potential for forestry is substantially larger. For buildings the potential is smaller, mainly related to the smaller mitigation potential for electric appliances than in the UNEP report. But overall, the estimates of the total mitigation potential are well aligned, which confirms there is substantial consistency across various emissions reduction estimates."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"The results of the sectoral mitigation potentials are also compared with mitigation impacts as calculated by IAMs. To this end, cumulative sectoral potentials over cost ranges were determined, based on the information in Table 12.3. For options that are in various cost ranges, we assumed that they are evenly distributed over these cost ranges. The only exception is wind and solar energy, for which it is indicated that the majority of the mitigation potential is in the negative cost range. It was assumed that the fraction in the negative cost range was 60%; the remainder is evenly distributed over the other cost ranges. These cumulative potentials were compared with emissions reductions realised in IAMs at certain price levels for CO2. Note that these price levels selected in IAMs are average price levels – not all IAMs use globally uniform carbon prices, so underlying these cost levels, there may be regional differentiation. Data were taken from the AR6 scenarios database. Note that, strictly speaking, not all models in the database are IAMs; in this analysis all models in the database were used, but the term IAMs is used as shorthand in the text that follows. All scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower are included for the comparison (i.e., the categories of scenarios C1 to C3 in Chapter 3). A comparison per sector is provided in Figure 12.1. It is important to note that two different things are compared in this figure: on the one hand emissions reduction potentials and on the other hand realisations of (part of) the potential within the context of a certain scenario. Having said that, a number of lessons can be learned from the comparison of both."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"For the energy supply sector, the emissions reductions projected by the IAMs are for the higher cost levels comparable with the potentials found in the sectoral analysis. But at lower cost levels, the emissions reductions as projected by IAMs are smaller than for the sectoral analysis. This is likely due to the fact that high costs for solar energy and wind energy are assumed in IAM models (Krey et al. 2019; Shiraki and Sugiyama 2020). This is not surprising, as the scenario database comprises studies dating back to 2015. A more detailed comparison for the power sector is given in Figure 12.2. Both the sectoral analysis and the IAMs find that both solar and wind energy in particular show strong growth potential, although there is a continuing role for other low-carbon technologies, like nuclear energy and hydropower."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"For the AFOLU sector, the sectoral studies provide net emissions reduction potentials comparable with projections from the IAMs at costs levels up to USD50 tCO2-eq –1. However, beyond that level the mitigation potential found in the sectoral analysis is larger than in the IAMs. For agriculture, it can be explained by the fact that carbon sequestration options, like soil carbon, biochar and agroforestry, have little to no representation in IAMs. Similarly, for forestry and other land use-related options, the protection and restoration of other ecosystems than forests (peatland, coastal wetlands and savannas) are not represented in IAMs. Also note that some IAM baselines already have small carbon prices, which induce land-based mitigation, while in others, mitigation, particularly from reduced deforestation, is part of the storyline even without an implemented carbon price. Both of these effects dampen the mitigation potential available in the USD100 tCO2-eq –1 carbon price scenario from IAMs. Furthermore, estimates of mitigation through forestry and other land use-related options from the AR6 IAM scenario database represent the net emissions from A/R and deforestation, thus are likely to be lower than the sectoral estimates of A/R potential expressed as gross removals."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"For the buildings and transport sectors, the sectoral mitigation potentials are higher than those projected by the IAMs. The difference in the transport sector is particularly significant. One possible explanation is that options with negative costs are already included in the reference. In addition, some options, like avoiding demand for energy services in the building sector and model shift in transportation, are less well represented in IAMs."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p14,NO_TITLE,"For the industry sector, the sectoral emissions reduction potentials are somewhat higher than those reported on average by IAMs. The difference can well be explained by the fact that most IAMs do not include circularity options like material efficiency and recycling; these options together account for 1.5 GtCO2-eq at costs levels from USD20 tCO2-eq –1 onwards."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p15,NO_TITLE,"For mitigation of emissions of methane and fluorinated gases, the comparability between the sectoral results and IAMs is good."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p16,NO_TITLE,"Overall, it is concluded that there are differences between the sectoral analyses and the IAM outcomes, but most of the differences can be explained by the exclusion of specific options in most IAMs. This comparability confirms the reliability of the sectoral analysis of emissions reduction potential. It also demonstrates the added value of sectoral analyses of mitigation potentials: they can more rapidly adapt to changes in price levels of technologies and adopt new options for emissions mitigation."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p17,NO_TITLE,"In this section, the information on individual options reported in Section 12.2.2 to sectoral and economy-wide totals has been aggregated. It is concluded that, based on the sectoral analysis, the global mitigation potential is in the range of 32 to 44 GtCO2-eq. This mitigation potential is substantially higher than that reported in AR4, but it is comparable to the more recent estimate by UNEP (2017). Differences exist with the results of IAMs, but most of these can be well explained. The conclusion that the global potential is in this range can be drawn with  high agreement  and robust evidence."
wg3_ch12_12.2.3_p18,NO_TITLE,"Given the median projection of the reference emissions of 60 GtCO2-eq in 2030, the range of mitigation potentials presented here is sufficient to bring down global emissions in the year 2030 to a level of 16 to 28 GtCO2-eq. Taking into account that there is a range in reference projections for 2030 of 54 to 68 GtCO2-eq, the resulting emissions level shows a wider range: 12 to 31 GtCO2-eq. This is about, or below half, the most recent (2019) emissions value of 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2-eq (high confidence)."
wg3_ch12_12.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"As noted previously, a more qualitative approach is followed and less quantitative information is presented for 2050. The sectoral results are summarised in Table 12.5. In addition to the many technologies that already play a role by 2030 (Table 12.3) additional technologies may be needed for deep decarbonisation, for example for managing power systems with high shares of intermittent renewable sources and for providing new fuels and associated infrastructure for sectors that are hard to decarbonise. New processes also play an important role, notably for industrial processes. In general, stronger sector coupling is needed, particularly increased integration of energy end use and supply sectors."
wg3_ch12_12.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to a cluster of technologies, practices, and approaches that remove and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and durably store the carbon in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. Despite the common feature of removing carbon dioxide, CDR methods can be very different (Smith et al. 2017). There are proposed methods for removal of non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane (Jackson et al. 2019; Jackson et al. 2021) but scarcity of literature on these methods prevents assessment here."
wg3_ch12_12.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"A number of CDR methods (e.g., afforestation/reforestation (A/R), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar, wetland/peatland restoration and coastal restoration) are dealt with elsewhere in this report (Chapters 6 and 7). These methods are synthesised in Section 12.3.2. Others, not dealt with elsewhere, – direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering (EW) of minerals and ocean-based approaches including ocean fertilisation (OF) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) – are discussed in Sections 12.3.1.1 to 12.3.1.3 below (see also IPCC 2019b and AR6 WGI, Section 5.6). Some methods, such as BECCS and DACCS, involve carbon storage in geological formations, which is discussed in Chapter 6. The climate system and the carbon cycle responses to CDR deployment and each method’s physical and biogeochemical characteristics such as storage form and duration are assessed in Chapters 4 and 5 of the AR6 WGI report."

It provides an overview of each CDR method: their costs, potentials, risks and impacts, co-benefits, and their role in mitigation pathways. Since these processes, approaches and technologies have medium to low technology readiness levels, they are subject to significant uncertainty."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Direct air capture (DAC) is a chemical process to capture ambient CO2 from the atmosphere. Captured CO2 can be stored underground (direct air carbon capture and storage, DACCS) or utilised in products (direct air carbon capture and utilisation, DACCU). DACCS shares with conventional CCS the transport and storage components but is distinct in its capture part. Because CO2 is a well-mixed GHG, DACCS can be sited relatively flexibly, though its locational flexibility is constrained by the availability of low-carbon energy and storage sites. Capturing the CO2 involves three basic steps: (i) contacting the air, (ii) capturing on a liquid or solid sorbent or a liquid solvent, and (iii) regeneration of the solvent or the sorbent (with heat, moisture and/or pressure). After capture, the CO2 stream can be stored underground or utilised. The duration of storage is an important consideration; geological reservoirs or mineralisation result in removal for more than 1000 years. The duration of the removal through DACCU (Breyer et al. 2019) varies with the lifetime of respective products (Wilcox et al. 2017; Bui et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Gunnarsson et al. 2018; Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering 2018; Creutzig et al. 2019), ranging from weeks to months for synthetic fuels to centuries or more for building materials (e.g., concrete cured using mineral carbonation) (Hepburn et al. 2019). The efficiency and environmental impacts of DACCS and DACCU options depend on the carbon intensity of the energy input (electricity and heat) and other lifecycle assessment (LCA) considerations (Zimmerman 2018; Jacobson 2019). See Chapters 6 and 11 for further details regarding carbon capture and utilisation. Another key consideration is the net carbon CO2 removal of DACCS over its lifecycle (Madhu et al. 2021). Deutz and Bardow (2021) and Terlouw et al. (2021) demonstrated that the life-cycle net emissions of DACCS systems can be negative, even for existing supply chains and some current energy mixes. They found that the GHG intensity of energy sources is a key factor."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"DAC options can be differentiated by the specific chemical processes used to capture ambient CO2 from the air and recover it from the sorbent (Fasihi et al. 2019). The main categories are (i) liquid solvents with high-temperature regeneration, (ii) solid sorbents with low-temperature regeneration and (iii) regenerating by moisturising of solid sorbents. Other approaches such as electro-swing (Voskian and Hatton 2019) have been proposed but are less developed. Compared to other CDR methods, the primary barrier to upscaling DAC is its high cost and large energy requirement ( high confidence) (Nemet et al. 2018), which can be reduced through innovation. It has therefore attracted entrepreneurs and private investments (IEA 2020b)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Status: There are some demonstration projects by start-up companies and academic researchers, who are developing various types of DAC, including aqueous potassium solvent with calcium carbonation and solid sorbents with heat regeneration (NASEM 2019). These projects are supported mostly by private investments and grants or sometimes serve utilisation niche markets (e.g., CO2 for beverages, greenhouses, enhanced oil recovery). As of 2021, there are more than ten plants worldwide, with a scale of ktCO2 yr –1 or smaller (Larsen et al. 2019; NASEM 2019; IEA 2020b). Because of the fundamental difference in the CO2 concentration at the capture stage, DACCS does not benefit directly from research, development and demonstration (RD&D) of conventional CCS. Public RD&D programmes dedicated to DAC have therefore been proposed (Larsen et al. 2019; NASEM 2019). Possible research topics include development of new liquid solvents, novel solid sorbents, and novel equipment or system designs, and the need for third-party evaluation of techno-economic aspects has also been emphasised (NASEM 2019). However, since basic research does not appear to be a primary barrier, both NASEM (2019) and Larsen et al. (2019) argue for a stronger focus on demonstration in the US context. Though the US and UK governments have begun funding DACCS research (IEA 2020b), the scale of R&D activities is limited."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Costs: As the process captures dilute CO2 (~0.04%) from the ambient air, it is less efficient and more costly than conventional carbon capture applied to power plants and industrial installations (with a CO2 concentration of ~10%) ( high confidence). The cost of a liquid solvent system is dominated by the energy cost (because of the much higher energy demand for CO2 regeneration, which reduces the efficiency) while capital costs account for a significant share of the cost of solid sorbent systems (Fasihi et al. 2019). The range of the DAC cost estimates found in the literature is wide (USD60–1000 tCO2–1) (Fuss et al. 2018) partly because different studies assume different use cases, differing phases (first plant vs n th plant) (Lackner et al. 2012), different configurations, and disparate system boundaries. Estimates of industrial origin are often on the lower side (Ishimoto et al. 2017). Fuss et al. (2018) suggest a cost range of USD600–1000 tCO2–1 for first-of-a-kind plants, and USD100–300 tCO2–1 as experience accumulates. An expert elicitation study found a similar cost level for 2050 with a median of around USD200 tCO2–1 (Shayegh et al. 2021) (medium evidence, medium agreement ). NASEM (2019) systematically evaluated the costs of different designs and found a range of 84–386 USD2015 tCO2–1 for the designs currently considered by active technology developers. This cost range excludes the site-specific costs of transportation or storage."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Potentials: There is no specific study on the potential of DACCS but the literature has assumed that the technical potential is virtually unlimited provided that high energy requirements could be met (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Marcucci et al. 2017; Fuss et al. 2018; Lawrence et al. 2018) since DACCS encounters fewer non-cost constraints than any other CDR method. Focusing only on the Maghreb region, Breyer et al. (2020) reported an optimistic potential 150 GtCO2 at less than USD61 tCO2–1 for 2050. Fuss et al. (2018) suggest a potential of 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr –1 by 2050 because of environmental side effects and limits to underground storage. In addition to the ultimate potentials, Realmonte et al. (2019) noted the rate of scale-up as a strong constraint on deployment. Meckling and Biber (2021) discuss a policy roadmap to address the political economy for upscaling. More systematic analysis on potentials is necessary; first and foremost on national and regional levels, including the requirements for low-carbon heat and power, water and material demand, availability of geological storage and the need for land in case of low-density energy sources such as solar or wind power."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Risks and impacts: DACCS requires a considerable amount of energy ( high confidence), depending on the type of technology, water, and make-up sorbents, while its land footprint is small compared to other CDR methods (Smith et al. 2016). Yet, depending on the source of energy for DACCS (e.g., renewables vs nuclear), DACCS could require a significant land footprint (NASEM 2019; Sekera and Lichtenberger 2020). The theoretical minimum energy requirement for separating CO2 gas from the air is about 0.5 GJ tCO2–1 (Socolow et al. 2011). Fasihi et al. (2019) reviewed the published estimates of energy requirements and found that for the current technologies, the total energy requirement is about 4–10 GJ tCO2–1, with heat accounting for about 80% and electricity about 20% (McQueen et al. 2021). At a 10 GtCO2 yr –1 sequestration scale, this would translate into 40–100 exajoules (EJ) yr –1 of energy consumption (32–80 EJ yr –1 for heat and 8–20 EJ yr –1 electricity), which can be contrasted with the current primary energy supply of about 600 EJ yr –1 and electricity generation of about 100 EJ yr –1. For the solid sorbent technology, low-temperature heat could be sourced from heat pumps powered by low-carbon sources such as renewables (Breyer et al. 2020), waste heat (Beuttler et al. 2019), and nuclear energy (Sandalow et al. 2018). Unless sourced from a clean source, this amount of energy could cause environmental damage (Jacobson 2019). Because DACCS is an open system, water lost from evaporation must be replenished. Water loss varies, depending on technology (including adjustable factors such as the concentration of the liquid solvent) as well as environmental conditions (e.g., temperate vs tropical climates). For a liquid solvent system, it can be 0–50 tH2O tCO2–1 (Fasihi et al. 2019). A water loss rate of about 1–10 tH2O tCO2–1 (Socolow et al. 2011) would translate into about 10–100 GtH2O (10–100 km 3) to capture 10 GtCO2 from the atmosphere. Some solid sorbent technologies actually produce water as a by-product, for example 0.8–2 tH2O tCO2–1 for a solid-sorbent technology with heat regeneration (Beuttler et al. 2019; Fasihi et al. 2019). Large-scale deployment of DACCS would also require a significant quantity of materials, and energy to produce them (Chatterjee and Huang 2020). Hydroxide solutions are currently being produced as a by-product of chlorine but replacement (make-up) requirement of such materials at scale exceeds the current market supply (Realmonte et al. 2019). The land requirements for DAC units are not large enough to be of concern (Madhu et al. 2021). Furthermore, these can be placed on unproductive lands, in contrast to biological CDR. Nevertheless, to ensure that CO2-depleted air does not enter the air contactor of an adjacent DAC system, there must be enough space between DAC units, similar to wind power turbines. Considering this, Socolow et al. (2011) estimated a land footprint of 1.5 km 2MtCO2–1. In contrast, large energy requirements can lead to significant footprints if low-density energy sources (e.g., solar PV) are used (Smith et al. 2016). For the issues associated with CO2 utilisation and storage, see Chapter 6."

(2018) proposed solid sorbent-based DAC plants as a Power-to-X technology that could use excess renewable power (at times of low or even negative prices), such operation would add additional costs. Installations would need to be designed for intermittent operations (i.e., at low load factors) which would negatively affect capital and operation costs (Daggash et al. 2018; Sandalow et al. 2018) as a high time-resolution model suggests a high utilisation rate (Breyer et al. 2020). Solid sorbent DAC designs can potentially remove more water from the ambient air than needed for regeneration, thereby delivering surplus water that would contribute to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) in arid regions (Sandalow et al. 2018; Fasihi et al. 2019)."

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Role in mitigation pathways: There are a few IAM studies that have explicitly incorporated DACCS. Stringent emissions constraints in these studies lead to high carbon prices, allowing DACCS to play an important role in mitigation. Chen and Tavoni (2013) examined the role of DACCS in an IAM (WITCH) and found that incorporating DACCS reduces the overall cost of mitigation and tends to postpone the timing of mitigation. The scale of capture goes up to 37 GtCO2 yr –1 in 2100. Akimoto et al. (2021) introduced DACCS in the IAM DNE21+, and also found the long-term marginal cost of abatement is significantly reduced by DACCS. Marcucci et al. (2017) ran MERGE-ETL, an integrated model with endogenous learning, and showed that DACCS allows for a model solution for the 1.5°C target, and that DACCS substitutes for BECCS under stringent targets. In their analysis, DACCS captures up to 38.3 GtCO2 yr –1 in 2100. Realmonte et al. (2019) modelled two types of DACCS (based on liquid and solid sorbents) with two IAMs (TIAM-Grantham and WITCH), and showed that in deep mitigation scenarios, DACCS complements, rather than substitutes, other CDR methods such as BECCS, and that DACCS is effective at containing mitigation costs. At the national scale, Larsen et al. (2019) utilised the Regional Investment and Operations (RIO) Platform coupled with the Energy PATHWAYS model, and explicitly represented DAC in US energy systems scenarios. They found that in a scenario that reaches net zero emissions by 2045, about 0.6 GtCO2 or 1.8 GtCO2 of DACCS would be deployed, depending on the availability of biological carbon sinks and bioenergy. The modelling supporting the European Commission’s initial proposal for net zero GHG emissions by 2050 incorporated DAC, with the captured CO2 used for both synthetic fuel production (DACCU) and storage (DACCS) (Capros et al. 2019). Fuhrman et al. (2021a) evaluated the role of DACCS across five shared socio-economic pathways with the GCAM modelling framework and identified a substantial role for DACCS in mitigation and a decreased pressure on land and water resources from BECCS, even under the assumption of limited energy efficiency improvement and conservative cost declines of DACCS technologies. The newest iteration of the World Economic Outlook by IEA (2021b) deploys CDR on a limited scale, and DACCS removes 0.6 GtCO2 in 2050 for its Net Zero CO2 Emissions scenario."

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Enhanced weathering involves (i) the mining of rocks containing minerals that naturally absorb CO2 from the atmosphere over geological timescales (as they become exposed to the atmosphere through geological weathering), (ii) the comminution of these rocks to increase the surface area, and (iii) the spreading of these crushed rocks on soils (or in the ocean/coastal environments; Section 12.3.1.3) so that they react with atmospheric CO2 (Schuiling and Krijgsman 2006; Hartmann et al. 2013; Beerling et al. 2018; Goll et al. 2021). Construction waste and waste materials from mining can also be used as a source material for enhanced weathering. Silicate rocks such as basalt, containing minerals rich in calcium and magnesium and lacking metal ions such as nickel and chromium, are most suitable for enhanced weathering (Beerling et al. 2018); they reduce soil solution acidity during dissolution, and promote the chemical transformation of CO2 to bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions can precipitate in soils and drainage waters as a solid carbonate mineral (Manning 2008), or remain dissolved and increase alkalinity levels in the ocean when the water reaches the sea (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The modelling study by Cipolla et al. (2021) found that rate of weathering is greater in high rainfall environments, and was increased by organic matter amendment."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Status: Enhanced weathering has been demonstrated in the laboratory and in small-scale field trials (TRL 3–4) but has yet to be demonstrated at scale (Beerling et al. 2018; Amann et al. 2020). The chemical reactions are well understood (Manning 2008; Gillman 1980; Gillman et al. 2001), but the behaviour of the crushed rocks in the field and potential co-benefits and adverse side effects of enhanced weathering require further research (Beerling et al. 2018). Small-scale laboratory experiments have calculated weathering rates that are orders of magnitude slower than the theoretical limit for mass transfer-controlled forsterite (Renforth et al. 2015; Amann et al. 2020) and basalt dissolution (Kelland et al. 2020). Uncertainty surrounding silicate mineral dissolution rates in soils, the fate of the released products, the extent of legacy reserves of mining by-products that might be exploited, location and availability of rock extraction sites, and the impact on ecosystems remain poorly quantified and require further research to better understand feasibility (Renforth 2012; Moosdorf et al. 2014; Beerling et al. 2018).

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Costs: Fuss et al. (2018), in a systematic review of the costs and potentials of CDR methods including enhanced weathering, note that costs are closely related to the source of the rock and the technology used for rock grinding and material transport (Renforth 2012; Hartmann et al. 2013; Strefler et al. 2018). Due to differences in the methods and assumptions between studies, literature ranges are highly uncertain and range from USD15–40 tCO2–1 to USD3460 tCO2–1 (Köhler et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2016). Renforth (2012) reported operational costs in the UK of applying mafic rocks (rocks with high magnesium and iron silicate mineral concentrations) of USD70–578 tCO2–1, and for ultramafic rocks (rocks rich in magnesium and iron silicate minerals but with very low silica content – the low silica content enhances weathering rates) of USD24–123 tCO2–1. Beerling et al. (2020) combined a spatially resolved weathering model with a techno-economic assessment to suggest costs of between USD54–220 tCO2–1 (with a weighted mean of USD118–128 tCO2–1).

The highest reported regional sequestration potential, 88.1 GtCO2 yr −1, is reported for the spreading of pulverised rock over a very large land area in the tropics, a region considered promising given the higher temperatures and greater rainfall (Taylor et al. 2016). Considering cropland areas only, the potential carbon removal was estimated by Strefler et al. (2018) to be 95 GtCO2 yr −1 for dunite and 4.9 GtCO2 yr −1 for basalt. Slightly lower potentials were estimated by Lenton (2014) where the potential of carbon removal by enhanced weathering (including adding carbonate and olivine to both oceans and soils) was estimated to be 3.7 GtCO2 yr –1 by 2100, but with mean annual removal an order of magnitude less at 0.2 GtC-eq yr –1 (Lenton 2014). The estimates reported in Smith et al. (2016) are based on the potential estimates of Lenton (2014). Beerling et al. (2020) estimate that up to 2 GtCO2 yr –1 could be removed by 2050 by spreading basalt onto 35–59% (weighted mean 53%) of agricultural land of 12 countries. Fuss et al.

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Co-benefits: Enhanced weathering can improve plant growth by pH modification and increased mineral supply (Kantola et al. 2017; Beerling et al. 2018), can enhance SCS in some soils (Beerling et al. 2018) thereby protecting against soil erosion (Wright and Upadhyaya 1998), and increasing the cation exchange capacity, resulting in increased nutrient retention and availability (Gillman 1980; Baldock and Skjemstad 2000; Gillman et al. 2001; Manning 2010; Guntzer et al. 2012; Tubana et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2017; Haque et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019a). Through these actions, it can contribute to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 15 (life on land) (by reducing land demand for croplands), SDG 13 (climate action) (through CDR), SDG 14 (life below water) (by ameliorating ocean acidification) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) (Smith et al. 2019a). To more directly ameliorate ocean acidification while increasing CDR and reducing impacts on land ecosystems, alkaline minerals could instead be directly added to the ocean (Section 12.3.1.3).

As noted above, any significant expansion of the mining industry would require careful assessment to avoid possible detrimental effects on biodiversity (Amundson et al. 2015). The processing of an additional 10 billion tonnes of rock would require up to 3000 Terawatt-hours of energy, which could represent approximately 0.1–6 % of global electricity use in 2100.

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The ocean, which covers over 70% of the Earth’s surface, contains about 38,000 gigatonnes of carbon, some 45 times more than the present atmosphere, and oceanic uptake has already consumed close to 30–40% of anthropogenic carbon emissions (Sabine et al. 2004; Gruber et al. 2019). The ocean is characterised by diverse biogeochemical cycles involving carbon, and ocean circulation has much longer timescales than the atmosphere, meaning that additional anthropogenic carbon could potentially be stored in the ocean for centuries to millennia for methods that increase deep ocean-dissolved carbon concentrations or temporarily bury the carbon; or essentially permanently (over ten thousand years) for methods that store the carbon in mineral forms or as ions by increasing alkalinity (Siegel et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1). A wide range of methods and implementation options for marine CDR have been proposed (Gattuso et al. 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; GESAMP 2019). The most studied ocean-based CDR methods are ocean fertilisation, alkalinity enhancement (including electrochemical methods) and intensification of biologically-driven carbon fluxes and storage in marine ecosystems, referred to as ‘blue carbon’. The mitigation potentials, costs, co-benefits and trade-offs of these three options are discussed below. Less well studied are methods including artificial upwelling, terrestrial biomass dumping into oceans, direct CO2 removal from seawater (with CCS), and sinking marine biomass into the deep ocean or harvesting it for bioenergy (with CCS) or biochar (GESAMP 2019). These methods are summarised briefly below. Potential climate response and influence on the carbon budget of ocean-based CDR methods are discussed in WGI AR6, Chapter 5."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"One natural mechanism of carbon transfer from the atmosphere to the deep ocean is the ocean biological pump, which is driven by the sinking of organic particles from the upper ocean. These particles derive ultimately from primary production by phytoplankton and most of them are remineralised within the upper ocean with only a small fraction reaching the deep ocean where the carbon can be sequestered on centennial and longer timescales . Increasing nutrient availability would stimulate uptake of CO2 through phytoplankton photosynthesis producing organic matter, some of which would be exported into the deep ocean, sequestering carbon. In areas of the ocean where macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) are available in sufficient quantities (about 25% of the total area), the growth of phytoplankton is limited by the lack of trace elements such as iron. Thus, OF CDR can be based on two implementation options to increase the productivity of phytoplankton (Minx et al. 2018): macronutrient enrichment and micronutrient enrichment. A third option, highlighted in GESAMP (2019), is based on fertilisation for fish stock enhancement, for instance, as naturally occurs in eastern boundary current systems. Iron fertilisation is the best-studied OF option to date, but knowledge so far is still inadequate to predict global ecological and biogeochemical consequences."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Status: OF has a natural analogue: periods of glaciation in the geological past are associated with changes in deposition of dust containing iron into the ocean. Increased formation of phytoplankton has also been observed during seasonal deposition of dust from the Arabian Peninsula and ash deposition on the ocean surface after volcanic eruptions (Achterberg et al. 2013; Jaccard et al., 2013; Olgun et al. 2013; Martínez-García et al. 2014). OF options may appear technologically feasible, and enhancement of photosynthesis and CO2 uptake from surface waters is confirmed by a number of field experiments conducted in different areas of the ocean, but there is scientific uncertainty about the proportion of newly-formed organic carbon that is transferred to deep ocean, and the longevity of storage (Blain et al. 2008; Williamson et al. 2012; Trull et al. 2015). The efficiency of OF also depends on the region and experimental conditions, especially in relation to the availability of other nutrients, light and temperature (Aumont and Bopp 2006). In the case of macronutrients, very large quantities are needed and the proposed scaling of this technique has been viewed as unrealistic (Williamson and Bodle 2016)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Costs: Ocean fertilisation costs depend on nutrient production and its delivery to the application area (Jones 2014). The costs range from USD2 tCO2–1 for fertilisation with iron (Boyd 2008) to USD457 tCO2–1 for nitrate (Harrison 2013). Reported costs for macronutrient application at USD20 tCO2–1 (Jones 2014) contrast with higher estimates by (Harrison 2013) reporting that low costs are due to overestimation of sequestration capacity and underestimation of logistical costs. The median of OF cost estimates, USD230 tCO2–1 (Gattuso et al., 2021) indicates low cost-effectiveness, albeit uncertainties are large."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Potentials: Theoretical calculations indicate that organic carbon export increases 2–20 kg per gram of iron added, but experiments indicate much lower efficiency: a significant part of the CO2 can be emitted back the atmosphere because much of the organic carbon produced is remineralised in the upper ocean. Efficiency also varies with location (Bopp et al. 2013). Between studies, there are substantial differences in the ratio of iron added to carbon fixed photosynthetically, and in the ratio of iron added to carbon eventually sequestered (Trull et al. 2015), which has implications both for the success of this strategy and its cost. Estimates indicate potentially achievable net sequestration rates of 1–3 GtCO2 yr –1 for iron fertilisation, translating into cumulative CDR of 100–300 GtCO2 by 2100 (Ryaboshapko and Revokatova 2015; Minx et al. 2018), whereas OF with macronutrients has a higher theoretical potential of 5.5 GtCO2 yr –1 (Harrison 2017; Gattuso et al. 2021). Modelling studies show a maximum effect on atmospheric CO2 of 15–45 parts per million volume in 2100 (Zeebe and Archer 2005; Aumont and Bopp 2006; Keller et al. 2014; Gattuso et al. 2021)."

Impacts on marine biology and food web structure are not well known, however OF at large scale could cause changes in nutrient distributions or anoxia in subsurface water (Fuhrman and Capone 1991; DFO 2010).

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"CDR through ‘ocean alkalinity enhancement’ or ‘artificial ocean alkalinisation’ (Renforth and Henderson 2017) can be based on: (i) the dissolution of natural alkaline minerals that are added directly to the ocean or coastal environments; (ii) the dissolution of such minerals upstream from the ocean (e.g., enhanced weathering, Section 12.3.1.2); (iii) the addition of synthetic alkaline materials directly to the ocean or upstream; and (iv) electrochemical processing of seawater. In the case of (ii), minerals are dissolved on land and the dissolution products are conveyed to the ocean through runoff and river flow. These processes result in chemical transformation of CO2 and sequestration as bicarbonate and carbonate ions (HCO3–, CO32–) in the ocean. Imbalances between the input and removal fluxes of alkalinity can result in changes in global oceanic alkalinity and therefore the capacity of the ocean to store carbon. Such alkalinity-induced changes in partitioning of carbon between atmosphere and ocean are thought to play an important role in controlling climate change on timescales of 1000 years and longer (e.g., Zeebe 2012). The residence time of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep ocean is around 100,000 years. However, residence time may decrease if alkalinity is reduced by a net increase in carbonate minerals by either increased formation (precipitation) or reduced dissolution of carbonate (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The alkalinity of seawater could potentially also be increased by electrochemical methods, either directly by reactions at the cathode that increase the alkalinity of the surrounding solution that can be discharged into the ocean, or by forcing the precipitation of solid alkaline materials (e.g., hydroxide minerals) that can then be added to the ocean (e.g., Rau et al. 2013; La Plante et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"Status: OAE has been demonstrated by a small number of laboratory experiments (in addition to enhanced weathering, Section 12.3.1.2). The use of enhanced ocean alkalinity for carbon storage was first proposed by Kheshgi (1995)  who considered the creation of highly reactive lime that would readily dissolve in the surface ocean and sequester CO2. An alternative method proposed the dissolution of carbonate minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate) in the presence of waste flue gas CO2 and seawater as a means capturing CO2 and converting it to bicarbonate ions (Rau and Caldeira 1999; Rau 2011). House et al. (2007) proposed the creation of alkalinity in the ocean through electrolysis. The fate of the stored carbon is the same for these proposals (i.e., HCO3– and CO32– ions), but the reaction pathway is different. Enhanced weathering of silicate minerals such as olivine could add alkalinity to the ocean, for example, by placing olivine sand in coastal areas (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017).  Some authors suggest use of maritime transport to discharge calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) (Caserini et al. 2021)."

Rau (2008) and Rau et al. (2018) estimate that electrochemical processes for increasing ocean alkalinity may have a net cost of USD3–160 tCO2–1, largely depending on energy cost and co-product (H2) market value. In the case of direct addition of alkaline minerals to the ocean (i.e., without calcination), the cost is estimated to be USD20–50 tCO2–1 (Harvey 2008; Köhler et al. 2013; Renforth and Henderson 2017)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"Potentials: For OAE, the ocean theoretically has the capacity to store thousands of GtCO2 (cumulatively) without exceeding pre-industrial levels of carbonate saturation (Renforth and Henderson 2017) if the impacts were distributed evenly across the surface ocean. The potential of increasing ocean alkalinity may be constrained by the capability to extract, process, and react minerals (Section 12.3.1.2); the demand for co-benefits (see below), or to minimise impacts around points of addition. Important challenges with respect to the detailed quantification of the CO2 sequestration efficiency include nonstoichiometric dissolution, reversed weathering and potential pore water saturation in the case of adding minerals to shallow coastal environments (Meysman and Montserrat 2017). Fuss et al. (2018) suggest storage potentials of 1–100 GtCO2 yr –1. (González and Ilyina 2016) suggested that addition of 114 picomoles of alkalinity to the surface ocean could remove 3400 GtCO2 from the atmosphere."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"Risks and impacts: For OAE, the local impact of increasing alkalinity on ocean chemistry can depend on the speed at which the impacted seawater is diluted/circulated and the exchange of CO2 from the atmosphere  (Bach et al. 2019). Also, more extreme carbonate chemistry perturbations due to non-equilibrated alkalinity could affect local marine biota (Bach et al. 2019), although biological impacts are largely unknown. Air-equilibrated seawater has a much lower potential to perturb seawater carbonate chemistry. However, seawater with slow air-sea gas exchange, in which alkalinity increases, consumes CO2 from the surrounding water without immediate replenishment from the atmosphere, which would increase seawater pH and saturation states and may impact marine biota (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017). It may be possible to use this effect to ameliorate ocean acidification. Like enhanced weathering, some proposals may result in the dissolution products of silicate minerals (e.g., silicon, iron, potassium, nickel) being supplied to ocean ecosystems (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017). Ecological and biogeochemical consequences of OAE largely depend on the minerals used. When natural minerals such as olivine are used, the release of additional Si and Fe could have fertilising effects (Bach et al. 2019). In addition to perturbations to marine ecosystems via reorganisation of community structure, potentially adverse effects of OAE that should be studied include the release of toxic trace metals from some deposited minerals (Hartmann et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p14,NO_TITLE,"Co-benefits: Intentional addition of alkalinity to the oceans through OAE would decrease the risk to ocean ecosystems caused by the CO2-induced impact of ocean acidification on marine biota and the global carbon cycle (Doney et al. 2009; Köhler et al. 2010; Rau et al. 2012; Williamson and Turley 2012; Albright et al. 2016; Bach et al. 2019). OAE could be jointly implemented with enhanced weathering (Section 12.3.1.2), spreading the finely crushed rock in the ocean rather than on land. Regional alkalinisation could be effective in protecting coral reefs against acidification (Feng et al. 2016; Mongin et al., 2021) and coastal OAE could be part of a broader strategy for geochemical management of the coastal zone, safeguarding specific coastal ecosystems, such as important shellfisheries, from the adverse impact of ocean acidification (Meysman and Montserrat 2017)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p15,NO_TITLE,"Trade-offs and spillover effects: There is a paucity of research on biological effects of alkalinity addition. The very few studies that have explored the impact of elevated alkalinity on ocean ecosystems have largely been limited to single species experiments (Cripps et al. 2013; Gore et al. 2019) and a constrained field study quantifying the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enhancement (Albright et al. 2016). The addition rate would have to be great enough to overcome mixing of the local seawater with the ambient environment, but not sufficient to detrimentally impact ecosystems. More research is required to assess locations in which this may be feasible, and how such a scheme may operate (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The environmental impact of large-scale release of natural dissolution products into the coastal environment will strongly depend on the scale of olivine application, the characteristics of the coastal water body (e.g., residence time) and the particular biota present (e.g., coral reefs will react differently compared with seagrasses) (Meysman and Montserrat 2017). Model simulations (González et al. 2018) suggest that termination of OAE implemented on a massive scale under a high CO2 emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) might pose high risks to biological systems sensitive to rapid environmental changes because it would cause a sharp increase in ocean acidification. For example, OAE termination would lead to a decrease in surface pH in warm shallow regions where vulnerable coral reefs are located, and a drop in the carbonate saturation state. However, other studies with lower levels of OAE have shown no termination effect (Keller et al., 2014)."

These processes are accompanied by carbon emissions. The conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems, which will lead to increased carbon sequestration, is also essential for the preservation of basic ecosystem services, and healthy ecosystems tend to be more resilient to the effects of climate change."

Because the deep water is much colder than surface water, at massive scale this could cool the Earth’s surface by several degrees, but the cooling effect would cease as the deeper ocean warms, and would reverse, leading to rapid warming, if the pumping ceased (Oschlies et al., 2010 , Keller et al. 2014)."

Sinking biochar has also been proposed (Miller and Orton, 2021). Decomposition would be inhibited by the cold and sometimes hypoxic/anoxic environment on the ocean floor, and absence of bacteria that decompose terrestrial lignocellulosic biomass, so storage timescale is estimated at hundreds to thousands of years (Strand and Benford 2009) (Burdige 2005). Potential side effects on marine ecosystems, chemistry, or circulation have not been thoroughly assessed.

Naturally-growing sargassum has also been considered for these purposes (Bach et al., 2021). Froehlich et al. (2019) found a substantial area of the ocean (about 48 million km 2) suitable for farming seaweed. N’Yeurt et al. (2012) suggested that converting 9% of the oceans to macroalgal aquaculture could take up 19 GtCO2 in biomass, generate 12 Gt per annum of biogas, and the CO2 produced by burning the biogas could be captured and sequestered. Productivity of farmed macroalgae in the open ocean could potentially be enhanced through fertilising via artificial upwelling (Fan et al., 2020) or through cultivation platforms that dive at night to access nutrient-rich waters below the, often nutrient-limited, surface ocean. If the biomass were sunk, it is unknown how long the carbon would remain in the deep ocean and what the additional impacts would be.

CO2 stripping can also be accomplished by acidifying seawater with a mineral acid, or through electrodialysis and electrolysis, to convert bicarbonate ions (HCO3–) to CO2 (Willauer et al., 2017; Eisaman et al., 2018; Digdaya et al., 2020; Eisaman 2020; Sharifian et al., 2021). The removal of CO2 from the ocean surface leads to undersaturation in the water, thus forcing CO2 to move from the atmosphere into the ocean to restore equilibrium. Electrochemical seawater CO2 extraction has been modelled, prototyped, and analysed from a techno-economic perspective (Eisaman et al., 2012; Willauer et al., 2017; de Lannoy et al., 2018; Eisaman et al., 2018a; Eisaman et al., 2018b)."

There is limited evidence to assess social-cultural, environmental/ecological, and institutional dimensions as the literature is still nascent for DACCS and EW, while these aspects are positive for blue carbon and mixed or negative for ocean fertilisation. On the economic dimension, the cost is assessed negatively for all CDR methods."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Direct air capture (DAC) is a chemical process to capture ambient CO2 from the atmosphere. Captured CO2 can be stored underground (direct air carbon capture and storage, DACCS) or utilised in products (direct air carbon capture and utilisation, DACCU). DACCS shares with conventional CCS the transport and storage components but is distinct in its capture part. Because CO2 is a well-mixed GHG, DACCS can be sited relatively flexibly, though its locational flexibility is constrained by the availability of low-carbon energy and storage sites. Capturing the CO2 involves three basic steps: (i) contacting the air, (ii) capturing on a liquid or solid sorbent or a liquid solvent, and (iii) regeneration of the solvent or the sorbent (with heat, moisture and/or pressure). After capture, the CO2 stream can be stored underground or utilised. The duration of storage is an important consideration; geological reservoirs or mineralisation result in removal for more than 1000 years. The duration of the removal through DACCU (Breyer et al. 2019) varies with the lifetime of respective products (Wilcox et al. 2017; Bui et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Gunnarsson et al. 2018; Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering 2018; Creutzig et al. 2019), ranging from weeks to months for synthetic fuels to centuries or more for building materials (e.g., concrete cured using mineral carbonation) (Hepburn et al. 2019). The efficiency and environmental impacts of DACCS and DACCU options depend on the carbon intensity of the energy input (electricity and heat) and other lifecycle assessment (LCA) considerations (Zimmerman 2018; Jacobson 2019). See Chapters 6 and 11 for further details regarding carbon capture and utilisation. Another key consideration is the net carbon CO2 removal of DACCS over its lifecycle (Madhu et al. 2021). Deutz and Bardow (2021) and Terlouw et al. (2021) demonstrated that the life-cycle net emissions of DACCS systems can be negative, even for existing supply chains and some current energy mixes. They found that the GHG intensity of energy sources is a key factor."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"DAC options can be differentiated by the specific chemical processes used to capture ambient CO2 from the air and recover it from the sorbent (Fasihi et al. 2019). The main categories are (i) liquid solvents with high-temperature regeneration, (ii) solid sorbents with low-temperature regeneration and (iii) regenerating by moisturising of solid sorbents. Other approaches such as electro-swing (Voskian and Hatton 2019) have been proposed but are less developed. Compared to other CDR methods, the primary barrier to upscaling DAC is its high cost and large energy requirement ( high confidence) (Nemet et al. 2018), which can be reduced through innovation. It has therefore attracted entrepreneurs and private investments (IEA 2020b)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Status: There are some demonstration projects by start-up companies and academic researchers, who are developing various types of DAC, including aqueous potassium solvent with calcium carbonation and solid sorbents with heat regeneration (NASEM 2019). These projects are supported mostly by private investments and grants or sometimes serve utilisation niche markets (e.g., CO2 for beverages, greenhouses, enhanced oil recovery). As of 2021, there are more than ten plants worldwide, with a scale of ktCO2 yr –1 or smaller (Larsen et al. 2019; NASEM 2019; IEA 2020b). Because of the fundamental difference in the CO2 concentration at the capture stage, DACCS does not benefit directly from research, development and demonstration (RD&D) of conventional CCS. Public RD&D programmes dedicated to DAC have therefore been proposed (Larsen et al. 2019; NASEM 2019). Possible research topics include development of new liquid solvents, novel solid sorbents, and novel equipment or system designs, and the need for third-party evaluation of techno-economic aspects has also been emphasised (NASEM 2019). However, since basic research does not appear to be a primary barrier, both NASEM (2019) and Larsen et al. (2019) argue for a stronger focus on demonstration in the US context. Though the US and UK governments have begun funding DACCS research (IEA 2020b), the scale of R&D activities is limited."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Costs: As the process captures dilute CO2 (~0.04%) from the ambient air, it is less efficient and more costly than conventional carbon capture applied to power plants and industrial installations (with a CO2 concentration of ~10%) ( high confidence). The cost of a liquid solvent system is dominated by the energy cost (because of the much higher energy demand for CO2 regeneration, which reduces the efficiency) while capital costs account for a significant share of the cost of solid sorbent systems (Fasihi et al. 2019). The range of the DAC cost estimates found in the literature is wide (USD60–1000 tCO2–1) (Fuss et al. 2018) partly because different studies assume different use cases, differing phases (first plant vs n th plant) (Lackner et al. 2012), different configurations, and disparate system boundaries. Estimates of industrial origin are often on the lower side (Ishimoto et al. 2017). Fuss et al. (2018) suggest a cost range of USD600–1000 tCO2–1 for first-of-a-kind plants, and USD100–300 tCO2–1 as experience accumulates. An expert elicitation study found a similar cost level for 2050 with a median of around USD200 tCO2–1 (Shayegh et al. 2021) (medium evidence, medium agreement ). NASEM (2019) systematically evaluated the costs of different designs and found a range of 84–386 USD2015 tCO2–1 for the designs currently considered by active technology developers. This cost range excludes the site-specific costs of transportation or storage."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Potentials: There is no specific study on the potential of DACCS but the literature has assumed that the technical potential is virtually unlimited provided that high energy requirements could be met (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Marcucci et al. 2017; Fuss et al. 2018; Lawrence et al. 2018) since DACCS encounters fewer non-cost constraints than any other CDR method. Focusing only on the Maghreb region, Breyer et al. (2020) reported an optimistic potential 150 GtCO2 at less than USD61 tCO2–1 for 2050. Fuss et al. (2018) suggest a potential of 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr –1 by 2050 because of environmental side effects and limits to underground storage. In addition to the ultimate potentials, Realmonte et al. (2019) noted the rate of scale-up as a strong constraint on deployment. Meckling and Biber (2021) discuss a policy roadmap to address the political economy for upscaling. More systematic analysis on potentials is necessary; first and foremost on national and regional levels, including the requirements for low-carbon heat and power, water and material demand, availability of geological storage and the need for land in case of low-density energy sources such as solar or wind power."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Risks and impacts: DACCS requires a considerable amount of energy ( high confidence), depending on the type of technology, water, and make-up sorbents, while its land footprint is small compared to other CDR methods (Smith et al. 2016). Yet, depending on the source of energy for DACCS (e.g., renewables vs nuclear), DACCS could require a significant land footprint (NASEM 2019; Sekera and Lichtenberger 2020). The theoretical minimum energy requirement for separating CO2 gas from the air is about 0.5 GJ tCO2–1 (Socolow et al. 2011). Fasihi et al. (2019) reviewed the published estimates of energy requirements and found that for the current technologies, the total energy requirement is about 4–10 GJ tCO2–1, with heat accounting for about 80% and electricity about 20% (McQueen et al. 2021). At a 10 GtCO2 yr –1 sequestration scale, this would translate into 40–100 exajoules (EJ) yr –1 of energy consumption (32–80 EJ yr –1 for heat and 8–20 EJ yr –1 electricity), which can be contrasted with the current primary energy supply of about 600 EJ yr –1 and electricity generation of about 100 EJ yr –1. For the solid sorbent technology, low-temperature heat could be sourced from heat pumps powered by low-carbon sources such as renewables (Breyer et al. 2020), waste heat (Beuttler et al. 2019), and nuclear energy (Sandalow et al. 2018). Unless sourced from a clean source, this amount of energy could cause environmental damage (Jacobson 2019). Because DACCS is an open system, water lost from evaporation must be replenished. Water loss varies, depending on technology (including adjustable factors such as the concentration of the liquid solvent) as well as environmental conditions (e.g., temperate vs tropical climates). For a liquid solvent system, it can be 0–50 tH2O tCO2–1 (Fasihi et al. 2019). A water loss rate of about 1–10 tH2O tCO2–1 (Socolow et al. 2011) would translate into about 10–100 GtH2O (10–100 km 3) to capture 10 GtCO2 from the atmosphere. Some solid sorbent technologies actually produce water as a by-product, for example 0.8–2 tH2O tCO2–1 for a solid-sorbent technology with heat regeneration (Beuttler et al. 2019; Fasihi et al. 2019). Large-scale deployment of DACCS would also require a significant quantity of materials, and energy to produce them (Chatterjee and Huang 2020). Hydroxide solutions are currently being produced as a by-product of chlorine but replacement (make-up) requirement of such materials at scale exceeds the current market supply (Realmonte et al. 2019). The land requirements for DAC units are not large enough to be of concern (Madhu et al. 2021). Furthermore, these can be placed on unproductive lands, in contrast to biological CDR. Nevertheless, to ensure that CO2-depleted air does not enter the air contactor of an adjacent DAC system, there must be enough space between DAC units, similar to wind power turbines. Considering this, Socolow et al. (2011) estimated a land footprint of 1.5 km 2MtCO2–1. In contrast, large energy requirements can lead to significant footprints if low-density energy sources (e.g., solar PV) are used (Smith et al. 2016). For the issues associated with CO2 utilisation and storage, see Chapter 6."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Co-benefits: While Wohland et al. (2018) proposed solid sorbent-based DAC plants as a Power-to-X technology that could use excess renewable power (at times of low or even negative prices), such operation would add additional costs. Installations would need to be designed for intermittent operations (i.e., at low load factors) which would negatively affect capital and operation costs (Daggash et al. 2018; Sandalow et al. 2018) as a high time-resolution model suggests a high utilisation rate (Breyer et al. 2020). Solid sorbent DAC designs can potentially remove more water from the ambient air than needed for regeneration, thereby delivering surplus water that would contribute to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) in arid regions (Sandalow et al. 2018; Fasihi et al. 2019)."

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Role in mitigation pathways: There are a few IAM studies that have explicitly incorporated DACCS. Stringent emissions constraints in these studies lead to high carbon prices, allowing DACCS to play an important role in mitigation. Chen and Tavoni (2013) examined the role of DACCS in an IAM (WITCH) and found that incorporating DACCS reduces the overall cost of mitigation and tends to postpone the timing of mitigation. The scale of capture goes up to 37 GtCO2 yr –1 in 2100. Akimoto et al. (2021) introduced DACCS in the IAM DNE21+, and also found the long-term marginal cost of abatement is significantly reduced by DACCS. Marcucci et al. (2017) ran MERGE-ETL, an integrated model with endogenous learning, and showed that DACCS allows for a model solution for the 1.5°C target, and that DACCS substitutes for BECCS under stringent targets. In their analysis, DACCS captures up to 38.3 GtCO2 yr –1 in 2100. Realmonte et al. (2019) modelled two types of DACCS (based on liquid and solid sorbents) with two IAMs (TIAM-Grantham and WITCH), and showed that in deep mitigation scenarios, DACCS complements, rather than substitutes, other CDR methods such as BECCS, and that DACCS is effective at containing mitigation costs. At the national scale, Larsen et al. (2019) utilised the Regional Investment and Operations (RIO) Platform coupled with the Energy PATHWAYS model, and explicitly represented DAC in US energy systems scenarios. They found that in a scenario that reaches net zero emissions by 2045, about 0.6 GtCO2 or 1.8 GtCO2 of DACCS would be deployed, depending on the availability of biological carbon sinks and bioenergy. The modelling supporting the European Commission’s initial proposal for net zero GHG emissions by 2050 incorporated DAC, with the captured CO2 used for both synthetic fuel production (DACCU) and storage (DACCS) (Capros et al. 2019). Fuhrman et al. (2021a) evaluated the role of DACCS across five shared socio-economic pathways with the GCAM modelling framework and identified a substantial role for DACCS in mitigation and a decreased pressure on land and water resources from BECCS, even under the assumption of limited energy efficiency improvement and conservative cost declines of DACCS technologies. The newest iteration of the World Economic Outlook by IEA (2021b) deploys CDR on a limited scale, and DACCS removes 0.6 GtCO2 in 2050 for its Net Zero CO2 Emissions scenario."

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Enhanced weathering involves (i) the mining of rocks containing minerals that naturally absorb CO2 from the atmosphere over geological timescales (as they become exposed to the atmosphere through geological weathering), (ii) the comminution of these rocks to increase the surface area, and (iii) the spreading of these crushed rocks on soils (or in the ocean/coastal environments; Section 12.3.1.3) so that they react with atmospheric CO2 (Schuiling and Krijgsman 2006; Hartmann et al. 2013; Beerling et al. 2018; Goll et al. 2021). Construction waste and waste materials from mining can also be used as a source material for enhanced weathering. Silicate rocks such as basalt, containing minerals rich in calcium and magnesium and lacking metal ions such as nickel and chromium, are most suitable for enhanced weathering (Beerling et al. 2018); they reduce soil solution acidity during dissolution, and promote the chemical transformation of CO2 to bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions can precipitate in soils and drainage waters as a solid carbonate mineral (Manning 2008), or remain dissolved and increase alkalinity levels in the ocean when the water reaches the sea (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The modelling study by Cipolla et al. (2021) found that rate of weathering is greater in high rainfall environments, and was increased by organic matter amendment."

Small-scale laboratory experiments have calculated weathering rates that are orders of magnitude slower than the theoretical limit for mass transfer-controlled forsterite (Renforth et al. 2015; Amann et al. 2020) and basalt dissolution (Kelland et al. 2020). Uncertainty surrounding silicate mineral dissolution rates in soils, the fate of the released products, the extent of legacy reserves of mining by-products that might be exploited, location and availability of rock extraction sites, and the impact on ecosystems remain poorly quantified and require further research to better understand feasibility (Renforth 2012; Moosdorf et al. 2014; Beerling et al. 2018).

Due to differences in the methods and assumptions between studies, literature ranges are highly uncertain and range from USD15–40 tCO2–1 to USD3460 tCO2–1 (Köhler et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2016). Renforth (2012) reported operational costs in the UK of applying mafic rocks (rocks with high magnesium and iron silicate mineral concentrations) of USD70–578 tCO2–1, and for ultramafic rocks (rocks rich in magnesium and iron silicate minerals but with very low silica content – the low silica content enhances weathering rates) of USD24–123 tCO2–1. Beerling et al. (2020) combined a spatially resolved weathering model with a techno-economic assessment to suggest costs of between USD54–220 tCO2–1 (with a weighted mean of USD118–128 tCO2–1).

The highest reported regional sequestration potential, 88.1 GtCO2 yr −1, is reported for the spreading of pulverised rock over a very large land area in the tropics, a region considered promising given the higher temperatures and greater rainfall (Taylor et al. 2016). Considering cropland areas only, the potential carbon removal was estimated by Strefler et al. (2018) to be 95 GtCO2 yr −1 for dunite and 4.9 GtCO2 yr −1 for basalt. Slightly lower potentials were estimated by Lenton (2014) where the potential of carbon removal by enhanced weathering (including adding carbonate and olivine to both oceans and soils) was estimated to be 3.7 GtCO2 yr –1 by 2100, but with mean annual removal an order of magnitude less at 0.2 GtC-eq yr –1 (Lenton 2014). The estimates reported in Smith et al. (2016) are based on the potential estimates of Lenton (2014). Beerling et al. (2020) estimate that up to 2 GtCO2 yr –1 could be removed by 2050 by spreading basalt onto 35–59% (weighted mean 53%) of agricultural land of 12 countries. Fuss et al.

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Co-benefits: Enhanced weathering can improve plant growth by pH modification and increased mineral supply (Kantola et al. 2017; Beerling et al. 2018), can enhance SCS in some soils (Beerling et al. 2018) thereby protecting against soil erosion (Wright and Upadhyaya 1998), and increasing the cation exchange capacity, resulting in increased nutrient retention and availability (Gillman 1980; Baldock and Skjemstad 2000; Gillman et al. 2001; Manning 2010; Guntzer et al. 2012; Tubana et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2017; Haque et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019a). Through these actions, it can contribute to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 15 (life on land) (by reducing land demand for croplands), SDG 13 (climate action) (through CDR), SDG 14 (life below water) (by ameliorating ocean acidification) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) (Smith et al. 2019a). To more directly ameliorate ocean acidification while increasing CDR and reducing impacts on land ecosystems, alkaline minerals could instead be directly added to the ocean (Section 12.3.1.3). There are potential benefits in poverty reduction through employment of local workers in mining (Pegg 2006)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Trade-offs and spillover effects: Air quality could be adversely affected by the spreading of rock dust (Edwards et al. 2017), though this can partly be ameliorated by water-spraying (Grundnig et al. 2006). As noted above, any significant expansion of the mining industry would require careful assessment to avoid possible detrimental effects on biodiversity (Amundson et al. 2015). The processing of an additional 10 billion tonnes of rock would require up to 3000 Terawatt-hours of energy, which could represent approximately 0.1–6 % of global electricity use in 2100. The emissions associated with this additional energy generation may reduce the net carbon dioxide removal by up to 30% with present-day grid average emissions, but this efficiency loss would decrease with low-carbon power (Beerling et al. 2020)."

wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The ocean, which covers over 70% of the Earth’s surface, contains about 38,000 gigatonnes of carbon, some 45 times more than the present atmosphere, and oceanic uptake has already consumed close to 30–40% of anthropogenic carbon emissions (Sabine et al. 2004; Gruber et al. 2019). The ocean is characterised by diverse biogeochemical cycles involving carbon, and ocean circulation has much longer timescales than the atmosphere, meaning that additional anthropogenic carbon could potentially be stored in the ocean for centuries to millennia for methods that increase deep ocean-dissolved carbon concentrations or temporarily bury the carbon; or essentially permanently (over ten thousand years) for methods that store the carbon in mineral forms or as ions by increasing alkalinity (Siegel et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1). A wide range of methods and implementation options for marine CDR have been proposed (Gattuso et al. 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; GESAMP 2019). The most studied ocean-based CDR methods are ocean fertilisation, alkalinity enhancement (including electrochemical methods) and intensification of biologically-driven carbon fluxes and storage in marine ecosystems, referred to as ‘blue carbon’. The mitigation potentials, costs, co-benefits and trade-offs of these three options are discussed below. Less well studied are methods including artificial upwelling, terrestrial biomass dumping into oceans, direct CO2 removal from seawater (with CCS), and sinking marine biomass into the deep ocean or harvesting it for bioenergy (with CCS) or biochar (GESAMP 2019). These methods are summarised briefly below. Potential climate response and influence on the carbon budget of ocean-based CDR methods are discussed in WGI AR6, Chapter 5."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"One natural mechanism of carbon transfer from the atmosphere to the deep ocean is the ocean biological pump, which is driven by the sinking of organic particles from the upper ocean. These particles derive ultimately from primary production by phytoplankton and most of them are remineralised within the upper ocean with only a small fraction reaching the deep ocean where the carbon can be sequestered on centennial and longer timescales . Increasing nutrient availability would stimulate uptake of CO2 through phytoplankton photosynthesis producing organic matter, some of which would be exported into the deep ocean, sequestering carbon. In areas of the ocean where macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) are available in sufficient quantities (about 25% of the total area), the growth of phytoplankton is limited by the lack of trace elements such as iron. Thus, OF CDR can be based on two implementation options to increase the productivity of phytoplankton (Minx et al. 2018): macronutrient enrichment and micronutrient enrichment. A third option, highlighted in GESAMP (2019), is based on fertilisation for fish stock enhancement, for instance, as naturally occurs in eastern boundary current systems. Iron fertilisation is the best-studied OF option to date, but knowledge so far is still inadequate to predict global ecological and biogeochemical consequences."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Status: OF has a natural analogue: periods of glaciation in the geological past are associated with changes in deposition of dust containing iron into the ocean. Increased formation of phytoplankton has also been observed during seasonal deposition of dust from the Arabian Peninsula and ash deposition on the ocean surface after volcanic eruptions (Achterberg et al. 2013; Jaccard et al., 2013; Olgun et al. 2013; Martínez-García et al. 2014). OF options may appear technologically feasible, and enhancement of photosynthesis and CO2 uptake from surface waters is confirmed by a number of field experiments conducted in different areas of the ocean, but there is scientific uncertainty about the proportion of newly-formed organic carbon that is transferred to deep ocean, and the longevity of storage (Blain et al. 2008; Williamson et al. 2012; Trull et al. 2015). The efficiency of OF also depends on the region and experimental conditions, especially in relation to the availability of other nutrients, light and temperature (Aumont and Bopp 2006). In the case of macronutrients, very large quantities are needed and the proposed scaling of this technique has been viewed as unrealistic (Williamson and Bodle 2016)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Costs: Ocean fertilisation costs depend on nutrient production and its delivery to the application area (Jones 2014). The costs range from USD2 tCO2–1 for fertilisation with iron (Boyd 2008) to USD457 tCO2–1 for nitrate (Harrison 2013). Reported costs for macronutrient application at USD20 tCO2–1 (Jones 2014) contrast with higher estimates by (Harrison 2013) reporting that low costs are due to overestimation of sequestration capacity and underestimation of logistical costs. The median of OF cost estimates, USD230 tCO2–1 (Gattuso et al., 2021) indicates low cost-effectiveness, albeit uncertainties are large."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Potentials: Theoretical calculations indicate that organic carbon export increases 2–20 kg per gram of iron added, but experiments indicate much lower efficiency: a significant part of the CO2 can be emitted back the atmosphere because much of the organic carbon produced is remineralised in the upper ocean. Efficiency also varies with location (Bopp et al. 2013). Between studies, there are substantial differences in the ratio of iron added to carbon fixed photosynthetically, and in the ratio of iron added to carbon eventually sequestered (Trull et al. 2015), which has implications both for the success of this strategy and its cost. Estimates indicate potentially achievable net sequestration rates of 1–3 GtCO2 yr –1 for iron fertilisation, translating into cumulative CDR of 100–300 GtCO2 by 2100 (Ryaboshapko and Revokatova 2015; Minx et al. 2018), whereas OF with macronutrients has a higher theoretical potential of 5.5 GtCO2 yr –1 (Harrison 2017; Gattuso et al. 2021). Modelling studies show a maximum effect on atmospheric CO2 of 15–45 parts per million volume in 2100 (Zeebe and Archer 2005; Aumont and Bopp 2006; Keller et al. 2014; Gattuso et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Risks and impacts:  Several of the mesoscale iron enrichment experiments have seen the emergence of potentially toxic species of diatoms (Silver et al. 2010; Trick et al. 2010). There is also (limited) evidence of increased concentrations of other GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide during the subsurface decomposition of the sinking particles from iron-stimulated blooms (Law 2008). Impacts on marine biology and food web structure are not well known, however OF at large scale could cause changes in nutrient distributions or anoxia in subsurface water (Fuhrman and Capone 1991; DFO 2010). Other potential risks are perturbation to marine ecosystems via reorganisation of community structure, enhanced deep ocean acidification (Oschlies et al. 2010 ) and effects on human food supply."

Ocean fertilisation is considered to have negative consequences for eight SDGs, and a combination of both positive and negative consequences for seven SDGs (Honegger et al. 2020)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"CDR through ‘ocean alkalinity enhancement’ or ‘artificial ocean alkalinisation’ (Renforth and Henderson 2017) can be based on: (i) the dissolution of natural alkaline minerals that are added directly to the ocean or coastal environments; (ii) the dissolution of such minerals upstream from the ocean (e.g., enhanced weathering, Section 12.3.1.2); (iii) the addition of synthetic alkaline materials directly to the ocean or upstream; and (iv) electrochemical processing of seawater. In the case of (ii), minerals are dissolved on land and the dissolution products are conveyed to the ocean through runoff and river flow. These processes result in chemical transformation of CO2 and sequestration as bicarbonate and carbonate ions (HCO3–, CO32–) in the ocean. Imbalances between the input and removal fluxes of alkalinity can result in changes in global oceanic alkalinity and therefore the capacity of the ocean to store carbon. Such alkalinity-induced changes in partitioning of carbon between atmosphere and ocean are thought to play an important role in controlling climate change on timescales of 1000 years and longer (e.g., Zeebe 2012). The residence time of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep ocean is around 100,000 years. However, residence time may decrease if alkalinity is reduced by a net increase in carbonate minerals by either increased formation (precipitation) or reduced dissolution of carbonate (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The alkalinity of seawater could potentially also be increased by electrochemical methods, either directly by reactions at the cathode that increase the alkalinity of the surrounding solution that can be discharged into the ocean, or by forcing the precipitation of solid alkaline materials (e.g., hydroxide minerals) that can then be added to the ocean (e.g., Rau et al. 2013; La Plante et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"Status: OAE has been demonstrated by a small number of laboratory experiments (in addition to enhanced weathering, Section 12.3.1.2). The use of enhanced ocean alkalinity for carbon storage was first proposed by Kheshgi (1995)  who considered the creation of highly reactive lime that would readily dissolve in the surface ocean and sequester CO2. An alternative method proposed the dissolution of carbonate minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate) in the presence of waste flue gas CO2 and seawater as a means capturing CO2 and converting it to bicarbonate ions (Rau and Caldeira 1999; Rau 2011). House et al. (2007) proposed the creation of alkalinity in the ocean through electrolysis. The fate of the stored carbon is the same for these proposals (i.e., HCO3– and CO32– ions), but the reaction pathway is different. Enhanced weathering of silicate minerals such as olivine could add alkalinity to the ocean, for example, by placing olivine sand in coastal areas (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017).  Some authors suggest use of maritime transport to discharge calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) (Caserini et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p11,NO_TITLE,"Costs: Techno-economic assessments of OAE largely focus on quantifying overall energy and carbon balances. Cost ranges are USD40–260 tCO2–1 (Fuss et al. 2018). Considering life-cycle carbon and energy balances for various OAE options, adding lime (or other reactive calcium or magnesium oxide/hydroxides) to the ocean would cost USD64–260 tCO2–1 (Renforth et al. 2013; Renforth & Kruger 2013; Caserini et al. 2019). Rau (2008) and Rau et al. (2018) estimate that electrochemical processes for increasing ocean alkalinity may have a net cost of USD3–160 tCO2–1, largely depending on energy cost and co-product (H2) market value. In the case of direct addition of alkaline minerals to the ocean (i.e., without calcination), the cost is estimated to be USD20–50 tCO2–1 (Harvey 2008; Köhler et al. 2013; Renforth and Henderson 2017)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"Potentials: For OAE, the ocean theoretically has the capacity to store thousands of GtCO2 (cumulatively) without exceeding pre-industrial levels of carbonate saturation (Renforth and Henderson 2017) if the impacts were distributed evenly across the surface ocean. The potential of increasing ocean alkalinity may be constrained by the capability to extract, process, and react minerals (Section 12.3.1.2); the demand for co-benefits (see below), or to minimise impacts around points of addition. Important challenges with respect to the detailed quantification of the CO2 sequestration efficiency include nonstoichiometric dissolution, reversed weathering and potential pore water saturation in the case of adding minerals to shallow coastal environments (Meysman and Montserrat 2017). Fuss et al. (2018) suggest storage potentials of 1–100 GtCO2 yr –1. (González and Ilyina 2016) suggested that addition of 114 picomoles of alkalinity to the surface ocean could remove 3400 GtCO2 from the atmosphere."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"Risks and impacts: For OAE, the local impact of increasing alkalinity on ocean chemistry can depend on the speed at which the impacted seawater is diluted/circulated and the exchange of CO2 from the atmosphere  (Bach et al. 2019). Also, more extreme carbonate chemistry perturbations due to non-equilibrated alkalinity could affect local marine biota (Bach et al. 2019), although biological impacts are largely unknown. Air-equilibrated seawater has a much lower potential to perturb seawater carbonate chemistry. However, seawater with slow air-sea gas exchange, in which alkalinity increases, consumes CO2 from the surrounding water without immediate replenishment from the atmosphere, which would increase seawater pH and saturation states and may impact marine biota (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017). It may be possible to use this effect to ameliorate ocean acidification. Like enhanced weathering, some proposals may result in the dissolution products of silicate minerals (e.g., silicon, iron, potassium, nickel) being supplied to ocean ecosystems (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017). Ecological and biogeochemical consequences of OAE largely depend on the minerals used. When natural minerals such as olivine are used, the release of additional Si and Fe could have fertilising effects (Bach et al. 2019). In addition to perturbations to marine ecosystems via reorganisation of community structure, potentially adverse effects of OAE that should be studied include the release of toxic trace metals from some deposited minerals (Hartmann et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p14,NO_TITLE,"Co-benefits: Intentional addition of alkalinity to the oceans through OAE would decrease the risk to ocean ecosystems caused by the CO2-induced impact of ocean acidification on marine biota and the global carbon cycle (Doney et al. 2009; Köhler et al. 2010; Rau et al. 2012; Williamson and Turley 2012; Albright et al. 2016; Bach et al. 2019). OAE could be jointly implemented with enhanced weathering (Section 12.3.1.2), spreading the finely crushed rock in the ocean rather than on land. Regional alkalinisation could be effective in protecting coral reefs against acidification (Feng et al. 2016; Mongin et al., 2021) and coastal OAE could be part of a broader strategy for geochemical management of the coastal zone, safeguarding specific coastal ecosystems, such as important shellfisheries, from the adverse impact of ocean acidification (Meysman and Montserrat 2017)."
wg3_ch12_12.3.1.3_p15,NO_TITLE,"Trade-offs and spillover effects: There is a paucity of research on biological effects of alkalinity addition. The very few studies that have explored the impact of elevated alkalinity on ocean ecosystems have largely been limited to single species experiments (Cripps et al. 2013; Gore et al. 2019) and a constrained field study quantifying the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enhancement (Albright et al. 2016). The addition rate would have to be great enough to overcome mixing of the local seawater with the ambient environment, but not sufficient to detrimentally impact ecosystems. More research is required to assess locations in which this may be feasible, and how such a scheme may operate (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The environmental impact of large-scale release of natural dissolution products into the coastal environment will strongly depend on the scale of olivine application, the characteristics of the coastal water body (e.g., residence time) and the particular biota present (e.g., coral reefs will react differently compared with seagrasses) (Meysman and Montserrat 2017). Model simulations (González et al. 2018) suggest that termination of OAE implemented on a massive scale under a high CO2 emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) might pose high risks to biological systems sensitive to rapid environmental changes because it would cause a sharp increase in ocean acidification. For example, OAE termination would lead to a decrease in surface pH in warm shallow regions where vulnerable coral reefs are located, and a drop in the carbonate saturation state. However, other studies with lower levels of OAE have shown no termination effect (Keller et al., 2014)."

Because the deep water is much colder than surface water, at massive scale this could cool the Earth’s surface by several degrees, but the cooling effect would cease as the deeper ocean warms, and would reverse, leading to rapid warming, if the pumping ceased (Oschlies et al., 2010 , Keller et al. 2014)."

Productivity of farmed macroalgae in the open ocean could potentially be enhanced through fertilising via artificial upwelling (Fan et al., 2020) or through cultivation platforms that dive at night to access nutrient-rich waters below the, often nutrient-limited, surface ocean.

Currently, few IAMs represent SCS or biochar (Frank et al. 2017). Given the removal potential of SCS and biochar and some potential co-benefits, more efforts should be made to include these methods within IAMs, so that their mitigation potential can be compared to other CDR methods, along with possible co-benefits and adverse side effects (Smith et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018) (Section 12.5)."

Land cover change associated with A/R and biomass supply for BECCS and biochar may cause albedo changes that reduce mitigation effectiveness (Fuss et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2019).

wg3_ch12_12.3.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Trade-offs and spillovers:  Some land-based biological CDR methods, such as BECCS and A/R, demand land. Combining mitigation strategies has the potential to increase overall carbon sequestration rates (Humpenöder et al. 2014). However, these CDR methods may also compete for resources (Frank et al. 2017). Land-based mitigation approaches currently propose the use of forests (i) as a source of woody biomass for bioenergy and various biomaterials and (ii) for carbon sequestration in vegetation, soils, and forest products. Forests are therefore required to provide both provisioning (biomass feedstock) and regulating (carbon sequestration) ecosystem services. This multifaceted strategy has the potential to result in trade-offs (Makkonen et al. 2015). Some land-based mitigation options could conflict with biodiversity goals, e.g., A/R using monoculture plantations can reduce species richness when introduced into (semi-)natural grasslands (Smith et al. 2019a; Dooley et al. 2021). When trade-offs exist between biodiversity protection and mitigation objectives, biodiversity is typically given a lower priority, especially if the mitigation option is considered risk-free and economically feasible (Pörtner et al. 2021). Approaches that promote synergies, such as sustainable forest management, reducing deforestation rates, cultivation of perennial crops for bioenergy in sustainable farming practices, and mixed-species forests in A/R, can mitigate biodiversity impacts and even improve ecosystem capacity to support biodiversity while mitigating climate change (Pörtner et al. 2021) (Section 12.5). Systematic land-use planning could help to deliver land-based mitigation options that also limit trade-offs with biodiversity (Longva et al. 2017) (Cross-Working Group Box 3: Mitigation and Adaptation via the Bioeconomy, in this chapter)."

wg3_ch12_12.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"As shown in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter, CDR fulfils multiple functions in different phases of ambitious mitigation: (i) further reducing net CO2 or GHG emission levels in the near term; (ii) counterbalancing residual emissions (from hard-to-transition sectors like transport, industry, or agriculture) to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions in the mid term; (iii) achieving and sustaining net-negative CO2 or GHG emissions in the long term. While inclusion of emissions and removals on managed land (LULUCF) is mandatory for developed countries under UNFCCC inventory rules (Grassi et al. 2021), not all Annex I countries have included land-based biological removals when setting domestic mitigation targets in the past, but updated NDCs for 2030 indicate a shift, most notably in the European Union (Gheuens and Oberthür 2021; Schenuit et al. 2021). The early literature on CDR governance and policy has been mainly conceptual rather than empirical, focusing on high-level principles (see the concerns listed in the introduction to Section 12.3) and the representation of CDR in global mitigation scenarios (Section 3.2.2). However, with the widespread adoption of net zero targets and the recognition that CDR is a necessary element of mitigation portfolios to achieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, countries with national net-zero emissions targets have begun to integrate CDR into modelled national mitigation pathways, increase research, development and demonstration (RD&D) efforts on CDR methods, and consider CDR-specific incentives and policies (Honegger et al. 2021b; Schenuit et al. 2021) (Box 12.1). Nevertheless, this increasing consideration of CDR has not yet extended to net-negative targets and policies to achieve these. While the use of CDR at levels that would lead to net negative CO2 or GHG emissions in the long term has been assumed in most global mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C, net-negative emissions trajectories and BECCS as the main CDR method modelled to achieve these have not been mirrored by corresponding UNFCCC decisions so far (Fridahl 2017; Mohan et al. 2021). Likewise, only a few national long-term mitigation plans or legal acts entail a vision for net-negative GHG emissions (Buylova et al. 2021), for example Finland, Sweden, Germany and Fiji."
wg3_ch12_12.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"For countries with emissions targets aiming for net zero or lower, the core governance question is not whether CDR should be mobilised or not, but which CDR methods governments want to see deployed by whom, by when, at which volumes and in which ways (Minx et al. 2018; Bellamy and Geden 2019). The choice of CDR methods and the scale and timing of their deployment will depend on the respective ambitions for gross emissions reductions, how sustainability and feasibility constraints are managed, and how political preferences and social acceptability evolve (Bellamy 2018; Forster et al. 2020; Fuss et al. 2020; Waller et al. 2020; Clery et al. 2021; Iyer et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021). As examples of emerging CDR policymaking at (sub-)national levels show, policymakers are beginning to incorporate CDR methods beyond those currently dominating global mitigation scenarios, that is, BECCS and afforestation/reforestation (Bellamy and Geden 2019; Buylova et al. 2021; Schenuit et al. 2021; Uden et al. 2021) (Box 12.1). CDR policymaking is faced with the need to consider method-specific timescales of CO2 storage, as well as challenges in MRV and accounting, potential co-benefits, adverse side effects, interactions with adaptation and trade-offs with SDGs (Dooley and Kartha 2018; McLaren et al. 2019; Buck et al. 2020; Honegger et al. 2020; Brander et al. 2021; Dooley et al. 2021; Mace et al. 2021) (Table 12.6). Therefore, CDR governance and policymaking are expected to focus on responsibly incentivising RD&D and targeted deployment, building on both technical and governance experience with already widely practised CDR methods like afforestation/reforestation (Lomax et al. 2015; Field and Mach 2017; Bellamy 2018; Carton et al. 2020; VonHedemann et al. 2020), as well as learning from two decades of slow-moving CCS deployment (Buck 2021; Martin-Roberts et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021). For some less well-understood methods and implementation options, such as ocean alkalinisation or enhanced weathering, investment in RD&D can help in understanding the risks, rewards, and uncertainties of deployment (Nemet et al. 2018; Fajardy et al. 2019; Burns and Corbett 2020; Goll et al. 2021)."

A food system approach was introduced in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (Mbow et al. 2019). Besides major knowledge gaps in the quantification of food system GHG emissions (Section 12.4.2), the SRCCL authors identified as major knowledge gaps the understanding of the dynamics of dietary change (including behavioural patterns, the adoption of plant-based dietary patterns, and interaction with human health and nutrition of sustainable healthy diets and associated feedbacks); and instruments and mechanisms to accelerate transitions towards sustainable and healthy food systems."

Food systems range from traditional, involving only few people and short supply chains, to modern food systems, comprising complex webs involving large numbers of stakeholders and processes that grow and transform food commodities into food products and distribute them globally (Gómez and Ricketts 2013; HLPE 2017). A ‘food system’ includes all food chain activities (production, processing, distribution, preparation, consumption of food) and the management of food loss and wastes. It also includes institutions and infrastructures influencing any of these activities, as well as people and systems impacted (HLPE 2017; FAO 2018a). Food choices are determined by the food environment, consisting of the ‘physical, economic, political and socio-cultural context in which consumers engage with the food system to acquire, prepare and consume food’ (HLPE 2017). Food system outcomes encompass food and nutrition, productivity, profit and livelihood of food producers and other actors in food value chains, but also social outcomes and the impact on the environment (Zurek et al. 2018). ‘Sustainable healthy diets’ have been defined by FAO and WHO (FAO and WHO 2019) as ‘dietary patterns that promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable’."

The authors identified major knowledge gaps for the GHG emissions inventories of food systems, particularly in providing disaggregated emissions from the food industry and transportation. The food system approach taken in the SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019) evaluates the synergies and trade-offs of food system response options and their implications for food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation. This integrated framework allows the identification of fundamental attributes of responses to maximise co-benefits, while avoiding maladaptation measures and adverse side effects. A food system approach supports the design of interconnected climate policy responses to tackle climate change, incorporating perspectives of producers and consumers. The SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019) found that the technical mitigation potential by 2050 of demand-side responses at 0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr –1 is comparable to supply-side options at 2.3–9.6 GtCO2-eq yr –1.

The industry sector data account for CO2 stored in urea (–50 MtCO2-eq yr –1). Packaging contributed about 6% of total food system emissions (0.98 GtCO2-eq yr –1, 91% as CO2, with CH4 emissions of 2.8 Mt CH4 yr –1). Major emissions sources are pulp and paper (60 MtCO2-eq yr –1) and aluminium (30 MtCO2-eq yr –1), with ferrous metals, glass, and plastics making a smaller contribution.

GHG emissions intensities – measured using attributional lifecycle assessment, considering the full supply chain, expressed as CO2-eq per kg of product or per kg of protein – are generally highest for ruminant meat, cheese, and certain crustacean species (e.g., farmed shrimp and prawns, trawled lobster) (Nijdam et al. 2012; Clark and Tilman 2017; Clune et al. 2017; Hilborn et al. 2018; Poore and Nemecek 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement ). Generally, beef from dairy systems has a lower footprint (8–23 kgCO2-eq per 100 g protein than beef from beef herds (17–94 kgCO2-eq per 100 g protein (Figure 12.6, re-calculated from Poore and Nemecek (2018) using AR6 GWPs based on a 100year horizon) (medium evidence,  high agreement ). The wide variation in emissions from beef reflects differences in production systems, which range from intensive feedlots with stock raised largely on grains through to rangeland and transhumance production systems. Dairy systems are generally more intensive production systems, with higher digestibility feed than beef systems. Further, emissions from dairy systems are shared between milk and meat, which brings GHG footprints of beef from dairy herds closer to those of meat from monogastric animals, with emissions intensities of pork (4.4–13 kgCO2-eq per 100 g protein) and poultry meat (2.3–11 kgCO2-eq per 100 g protein) (Poore and Nemecek 2018)."

For capture fish, large differences in emissions have been found, ranging from 0.2–7.9 kgCO2-eq kg –1 landed fish (Parker et al. 2018), although an environmental comparison of capture fish to farmed foods should include other indicators such as overfishing. Plant-based foods generally have lower GHG emissions (–2.2 to +4.5 kgCO2-eq per 100 g protein) than farmed animal-based foods (Nijdam et al. 2012; Clark and Tilman 2017; Clune et al. 2017; Hilborn et al. 2018; Poore and Nemecek 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement ). Several plant-based foods are associated with emissions from land use change, for example, palm oil, soy and coffee (Poore and Nemecek 2018), although emissions intensities are context specific (Meijaard et al. 2020) and for plant-based proteins, GHG footprints per serving remain lower than those of animal source proteins (Kim et al. 2019).

wg3_ch12_12.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"In traditional production systems, especially in developing countries, livestock serve multiple functions, providing draught power, fertiliser, investment and social status, besides constituting an important source of nutrients (Weiler et al. 2014). In landscapes dominated by forests or cropland, semi-natural pastures grazed by ruminants provide heterogeneity that supports biodiversity (Röös et al. 2016). Grazing on marginal land and the use of crop residues and food waste can provide human-edible food with lower demands for cropland (Röös et al. 2016; Van Zanten et al. 2018; Van Hal et al. 2019). Animal protein requires more land than vegetable protein, so switching consumption from animal to vegetable proteins could reduce the pressure on land resources and potentially enable additional mitigation through expansion of natural ecosystems, storing carbon while supporting biodiversity, or reforestation to sequester carbon and enhance wood supply capacity for the production of bio-based products substituting fossil fuels, plastics, cement, etc. (Schmidinger and Stehfest 2012; Searchinger et al. 2018b; Hayek et al. 2021). At the same time, alternatives to animal-based meat and other livestock products are being developed (Figure 12.6). Their increasing visibility in supermarkets and catering services, as well as falling production prices, could make meat substitutes competitive in one to two decades (Gerhardt et al. 2019). However, uncertainty around their uptake creates uncertainty around their effect on future GHG emissions."

The colours of the bubbles indicate the relative contribution of the following risk factors to deaths, according to the classification used in the Global Burden of Disease Study: child and maternal malnutrition (red, deficiencies of iron, zinc or Vitamin A, or low birth weight or child growth failure), dietary risks (yellow, for example diets low in vegetables, legumes, whole grains or diets high in red and processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages) or high body mass index (blue). The combined contribution of these three risk factors to total deaths varies strongly and is between 28% and 88% of total deaths. Figure 12.7 shows that dietary risk factors are prevalent throughout all regions.

wg3_ch12_12.4.3_p10,Controlled-environment Agriculture ,"Food system mitigation opportunities can be either incremental or transformative (Kugelberg et al. 2021). Incremental options are based on mature technologies, for which processes and causalities are understood, and their implementation is generally accepted by society. They do not require a substantial change in the way food is produced, processed, or consumed and might lead to a (slight) shift in production systems or preferences. Transformative mitigation opportunities have wider food system implications and usually coincide with a significant change in food choices. They are based on technologies that are not yet mature and are expected to require further innovation (Klerkx and Rose 2020), and/or mature technologies that might already be part of some food systems but are not yet widely accepted and have transformative potential if applied at large scale, for example consumption of insects (Raheem et al. 2019a). Many emerging technologies might be seen as a further step in agronomic development where land-intensive production methods relying on the availability of naturally-available nutrients and water are successively replaced with crop variants and cultivation practices reducing these dependencies at the cost of larger energy input (Winiwarter et al. 2014). Others suggest a shift to agroecological approaches combining new scientific insights with local knowledge and cultural values (HLPE 2019). Food system transformation can lead to regime shifts or (fast) disruptions (Pereira et al. 2020) if driven by events that are out of control of private or public measures and have a ‘crisis’ character (e.g., BSE) (Skuce et al. 2013)."

Soy beans, in particular, have a well-balanced amino acid profile with high bio-availability (Leinonen et al. 2019).

Pulses play a key role in crop rotations, fixing nitrogen and breaking disease cycles, but yields of pulses are relatively low and have seen small yield increases relative to those of cereals (Foyer et al. 2016; McDermott and Wyatt 2017; Barbieri et al. 2021; Semba et al. 2021)."

The concept of cellular agriculture (Mattick 2018) covers bio-technological processes that use micro-organisms to produce acellular (fermentation-based cellular agriculture) or cellular products. Yeasts, fungi or bacteria can synthesise acellular products such as haem, milk and egg proteins, or protein-rich animal feed, other food ingredients, and pharmaceutical and material products (Rischer et al. 2020; Mendly-Zambo et al. 2021).

However, Clapp (2017) argues that the main economic benefit of trade liberalisation flows to large transnational firms. Benton and Bailey (2019) argue that low food prices in the second half of last century contributed to both yield and food waste increases, and to a focus on staple crops to the disadvantage of nutrient-dense foods. However, global trade can also contribute to economic benefits such as jobs and income, reduce food insecurity and facilitate access to nutrients (Wood et al. 2018; Hoff et al. 2019; Traverso and Schiavo 2020; Geyik et al. 2021) and has contributed to increased food supply diversity (Kummu et al. 2020).

For example, in the frame of the Pacific Obesity Prevention in Communities project, the Fijian government implemented three measures (out of seven proposed) that eliminated import duties on fruits and vegetables, and imposed 15% import duties on unhealthy oils (Latu et al. 2018). Trade agreements, however, have the potential to undermine national efforts to improve public health (Unar-Munguía et al. 2019). GHG mitigation efforts in food supply chains can be counteracted by GHG leakage, with a general increase of environmental and social impact in developing countries exporting food products, and a decrease in the developed countries importing food products (Fellmann et al. 2018; Sandström et al. 2018; Wiedmann and Lenzen 2018).

Misconceptions may contribute, for example, to the belief that packaging or ‘food miles’ dominate the climate impact of food (Macdiarmid et al. 2016). However, spillover effects can induce sustainable behaviour from ‘entry points’ such as concerns about food waste (El Bilali 2019). Early-life experiences are crucial determinants for adopting healthy and sustainable lifestyles (Bascopé et al. 2019; McBey et al. 2019), so improved understanding of sustainability aspects in the education of public health practitioners and in university education is proposed (Wegener et al. 2018).

Front-of-package labels serve also as an incentive to industry to produce healthier or more sustainable products, or can serve as a marketing strategy (Van Loo et al. 2014; Apostolidis and McLeay 2016; Kanter et al. 2018b). Carbon footprint labels can be difficult for consumers to understand (Hyland et al. 2017), and simple, interpretative summary indicators used on front-of-package labels (e.g., traffic lights) are more effective than more complex ones (Bauer and Reisch 2019; Ikonen et al. 2019; Temple 2019; Tørris and Mobekk 2019) (robust evidence, high agreement ).

There is evidence that choice architecture (‘nudging’) can be effective in influencing purchase decisions, but regulators do not normally explore this option (Broers et al. 2017). Examples of green nudging include making the sustainable option the default option, enhancing visibility, accessibility of, or exposure to, sustainable products and reducing visibility and accessibility of unsustainable products, or increasing the salience of healthy sustainable choices through social norms or food labels (Bucher et al. 2016; Wilson et al. 2016; Broers et al. 2017; Al-Khudairy et al. 2019; Bauer and Reisch 2019; Ferrari et al. 2019; Weinrich and Elshiewy 2019; Cialdini and Jacobson 2021). Available evidence suggests that choice architecture measures are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement (Ferrari et al. 2019; Tørris and Mobekk 2019), they are a preferred solution if a restriction of choices is to be avoided (Wilson et al. 2016; Kraak et al. 2017; Vecchio and Cavallo 2019), and can be effective (Arno and Thomas 2016; Bucher et al. 2016; Bianchi et al. 2018b; Cadario and Chandon 2018) if embedded in policy packages (Wilson et al. 2016; Tørris and Mobekk 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement )."

Top-down integration, mandatory mainstreaming, or boundary-spanning structures like public-private partnerships may be introduced to promote coordination (Termeer et al. 2018). ‘Flow-centric’ rather than territory-centric governance combined with private governance mechanisms has enabled codes of conduct and certification schemes (Eakin et al. 2017), for example the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), as well as commodity chain transparency initiatives and platforms like Trase  (Meijaard et al. 2020; Pirard et al. 2020).

GHG emissions from food systems can be impacted by both interventions targeted at different parts of the food system and interventions in other systems, such as reducing deforestation or promoting reforestation (Lee et al. 2019). For example, policies targeting health can contribute to diet shifts away from red meat, while also influencing GHG emissions (Springmann et al. 2018b; Semba et al. 2020); national and local food self-sufficiency policies may also have GHG impacts (Kriewald et al. 2019; Loon et al. 2019). Cross-sectoral governance could enhance synergies between reduced GHG emissions from food systems and other goals; however, integrative paradigms for cross-sectoral governance between food and other sectors have faced implementation challenges (Delaney et al. 2018). For example, in the late 2000s, the water-energy-food nexus emerged as a framework for cross-sectoral governance, but has not been well integrated into policy (Urbinatti et al. 2020), perhaps because of perceptions that it is an academic concept, or that it takes a technical-administrative view of governance; simply adopting the paradigm is not sufficient to develop effective nexus governance (Cairns and Krzywoszynska 2016; Weitz et al. 2017; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018). Other policy paradigms and theoretical frameworks that aim to integrate food systems governance include system transition, agroecology, multifunctionality in agriculture (Andrée et al. 2018), climate-smart agriculture (Taylor 2018) and the circular economy (Box 12.4). Cross-sectoral coordination on food systems and climate governance could be aided by internal recognition and ownership by agencies, dedicated budgets for cross-sectoral projects, and consistency in budgets (Pardoe et al. 2018) (Boxes 12.1 and 12.2)."

The city-region has been proposed as a useful focus for food system governance (Vermeulen et al. 2020); for example, the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact involves 180 global cities committed to integrative food system strategies (Candel 2019; Moragues-Faus 2021). Local food policy groups and councils that assemble stakeholders from government, civil society, and the private sector have formed trans-local networks of place-based local food policy groups, with over two hundred food policy councils worldwide (Andrée et al. 2018).

Global governance institutions like the Committee on World Food Security can promote policy coherence globally and reinforce accountability at all levels (McKeon 2015), as can norm-setting efforts like the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (FAO 2012). Global multi-stakeholder processes like the UN Food Systems Summit can foster the development of principles for guiding further actions based on sound scientific evidence.

In this section we expand beyond the scope of the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) assessment to include also mitigation measures that occupy land while not being considered land-based measures, we discuss ways to minimise potential adverse effects, and we consider the potential for synergies through integrating mitigation measures with other land uses, by applying a systems perspective that seeks to meet multiple objectives from multi-functional landscapes.

The SRCCL concluded that conversion of land for A/R and bioenergy crops at the scale commonly found in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C is associated with multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints, including land carbon losses ( high confidence). Pathways in which warming exceeds 1.5°C require less land-based mitigation, but the impacts of higher temperatures on regional climate and land, including land degradation, desertification, and food insecurity, become more severe (Smith et al. 2019b)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Depending on emissions-reduction targets, the portfolio of mitigation options chosen, and the policies developed to support their implementation, different land-use pathways can arise with large differences in resulting agricultural and forest area. Some response options can be more effective when applied together (Smith et al. 2019b); for example, dietary change, efficiency increases, and reduced wastage can reduce emissions as well as the pressure on land resources, potentially enabling additional land-based mitigation such as A/R and cultivation of biomass crops for biochar, bioenergy and other bio-based products. The SRCCL (Smith et al. 2019b) report that dietary change combined with reduction in food loss and waste can reduce the land requirement for food production by up to 5.8 Mkm 2 (0.8–2.4 Mkm 2 for dietary change; about 2 Mkm 2 for reduced post-harvest losses, and 1.4 Mkm 2 for reduced food waste) (Parodi et al. 2018; Springmann et al. 2018; Clark et al. 2020; Rosenzweig et al. 2020b) (Sections 7.4 and 12.4). Stronger mitigation action in the near term targeting non-CO2 emissions reduction and deployment of other CDR options (DACCS, enhanced weathering, ocean-based approaches; see Section 12.3) can reduce the land requirement for land-based mitigation (Obersteiner et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018)."

However, IAMs do not capture more subtle changes in land management and in the associated industrial/energy systems due to relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolution, and limited representation of land quality and feedstocks/management practices, interactions between biomass production and conversion systems, and local context, for example, governance of land use (Daioglou et al. 2019; Rose et al. 2020; Welfle et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021). A/R have generally been modelled as forests managed for carbon sequestration alone, rather than forestry providing both carbon sequestration and biomass supply (Calvin et al. 2021). Because IAMs do not include options to integrate new biomass production with existing agricultural and forestry systems (Paré et al. 2016; Mansuy et al. 2018; Cossel et al. 2019; Braghiroli and Passarini 2020; Djomo et al. 2020; Moreira et al. 2020; Strapasson et al. 2020; Rinke Dias de Souza et al. 2021), they may over-estimate the total additional land area required for biomass production. On the other hand, some integrated biomass production systems may prove less attractive to landholders than growing biomass crops in large blocks, from logistic, economic, or other points of view (Ssegane et al. 2016; Busch 2017; Ferrarini et al. 2017)."

Land occupation of solar technologies is considered to be underestimated in studies assuming ideal conditions, with real occupation being five to ten times higher (De Castro et al. 2013; MacKay 2013; Ong et al. 2013; Smil 2015; Capellán-Pérez et al. 2017)."

Indicative electricity-to-hydrocarbon fuel efficiency loss is estimated at about 60% (Ueckerdt et al. 2021). The advantage of smaller land occupation for solar, wind, hydro and nuclear, compared with biomass-based options, is therefore smaller for hydrocarbon fuels than for electricity. Furthermore, biofuels are often co-produced with other bio-based products, which further reduces their land occupation, although comparisons are complicated by inconsistent approaches to allocating land occupation between co-products (Ahlgren et al. 2015; Czyrnek-Delêtre et al. 2017)."

Furthermore, the requirements of transport in grids, pipelines and so on differ. For example, electricity from buildings-integrated PV can be used in the same location as it is generated."

Land occupation associated with different mitigation options can be large uniform areas (e.g., large solar farms, reservoir hydropower dams, or tree plantations), or more distributed, such as wind turbines, solar PV, and patches of biomass cultivation integrated with other land uses in heterogeneous landscapes (Cacho et al. 2018; Jager and Kreig 2018; Correa et al. 2019; Englund et al. 2020a). Studies with broader scope, covering total land use requirement induced by plant infrastructure, provide a more complete picture of land footprints. For example, Wu et al. (2021) quantified a land footprint for the infrastructure of a pilot solar plant being three times the onsite land area. Sonter et al. (2020b) found significant overlap of mining areas (82% targeting materials needed for renewable energy production) and biodiversity conservation sites and priorities, suggesting that strategic planning is critical to address mining threats to biodiversity (Section 12.5.4) along with recycling and exploration of alternative technologies that use that use abundant minerals (Box 10.6)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"There are also situations where expanding mitigation is more or less decoupled from additional land use. The use of organic consumer waste, harvest residues and processing side-streams in the agriculture and forestry sectors can support significant volumes of bio-based products with relatively lower land-use change risks than dedicated biomass production systems (Hanssen et al. 2019; Spinelli et al. 2019; Mouratiadou et al. 2020). Such uses can provide waste management solutions while increasing the mitigation achieved from the land that is already used for agricultural and forest production. Bioenergy accounts for about 90% of renewable heat used in industrial applications, mainly in industries that can use their own biomass waste and residues, such as the pulp and paper industry, food industry, and ethanol production plants (IEA 2020c) (Chapters 6 and 11). Heat and electricity produced on-site from side-streams but not needed for the industrial processes can be sold to other users, such as district heating systems. Surplus waste and residues can also be used to produce solid and liquid biofuels, or be used as feedstock in other industries such as the petrochemical industry (IRENA 2018; Lock and Whittle 2018; Thunman et al. 2018; IRENA 2019; Haus et al. 2020) (Chapters 6 and 11). Electrification and improved process efficiencies can reduce GHG emissions and increase the share of harvested biomass that is used for production of bio-based products (Johnsson et al. 2019; Madeddu et al. 2020; Lipiäinen and Vakkilainen 2021; Rahnama Mobarakeh et al. 2021; Silva et al. 2021) (Chapter 11). Besides integrating solar thermal panels and solar PV into buildings and other infrastructure, floating solar PV panels in, for example, hydropower dams (Ranjbaran et al. 2019; Cagle et al. 2020; Haas et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2020; Gonzalez Sanchez et al. 2021), and over canals (Lee et al. 2020; McKuin et al. 2021) could decouple renewable energy generation from land use while simultaneously reducing evaporation losses and potentially mitigating aquatic weed growth and climate change impacts on water body temperature and stratification (Cagle et al. 2020; Exley et al. 2021; Gadzanku et al. 2021; Solomin et al. 2021)."

This section focuses on mitigation options that have significant risks, impacts and/or co-benefits with respect to land resources, food security and the environment. Bioenergy (with or without CCS), biochar and bio-based products require biomass feedstocks that can be obtained from purpose-grown crops, residues from conventional agriculture and forestry systems, or from biomass wastes, each with different implications for the land. Here we consider separately (i) ‘biomass-based systems’, including dedicated biomass crops (e.g., perennial grasses, short rotation woody crops) and biomass produced as a co-product of conventional agricultural production (e.g., maize stover), and (ii) ‘afforestation/reforestation’, including forests established for ecological restoration and plantations grown for forest products and agroforestry, where biomass may also be a co-product. We then discuss impacts and opportunities common to both systems, before considering impacts and opportunities associated with non-land-based mitigation options that nevertheless occupy land."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Mitigation options that are based on the use of biomass, that is, bioenergy/BECCS, biochar, wood buildings, and other bio-based products, can have different positive and negative effects depending on the character of the mitigation option, the land use, the biomass conversion process, how the bio-based products are used and what other product they substitute (Leskinen et al. 2018; Howard et al. 2021; Myllyviita et al. 2021). The impacts of the same mitigation option can therefore vary significantly and the outcome in addition depends on previous land/biomass use (Cowie et al. 2021). As biomass-based systems commonly produce multiple food, material and energy products, it is difficult to disentangle impacts associated with individual bio-based products (Ahlgren et al. 2015; Djomo et al. 2017; Obydenkova et al. 2021). As for other mitigation options, governance has a critical influence on outcome, but larger scale and higher expansion rate generally translates into higher risk for negative outcomes such as competition for scarce land, freshwater and phosphorous resources, displacement of natural ecosystems, and diminishing capacity of agroecosystems to support biodiversity and essential ecosystem services, especially if produced without sustainable land management and in inappropriate contexts (Popp et al. 2017; Dooley and Kartha 2018; Hasegawa et al. 2018; Heck et al. 2018; Humpenöder et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2019; Hurlbert et al. 2019; IPBES 2019; Smith et al. 2019b; Drews et al. 2020; Hasegawa et al. 2020; Schulze et al. 2020; Stenzel et al. 2021) (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Removal of crop and forestry residues can cause land degradation through soil erosion and decline in nutrients and soil organic matter (Cherubin et al. 2018) (robust evidence,  high agreement ). These risks can be reduced by retaining a proportion of the residues to protect the soil surface from erosion and moisture loss and maintain or increase soil organic matter (Section 7.4.3.6); incorporating a perennial groundcover into annual cropping systems (Moore et al. 2019); and by replacing nutrients removed, such as by applying ash from bioenergy combustion plants (Kludze et al. 2013; Harris et al. 2015; Warren Raffa et al. 2015; de Jong et al. 2017) while safeguarding against contamination risks (Pettersson et al. 2020) (medium evidence,  high agreement ). Besides topography, soil, and climate conditions, sustainable residue removal rates also depend on the fate of extracted biomass. For example, to maintain the same level of soil organic carbon, the harvest of straw, if used for combustion (which would return no carbon to fields), was estimated to be only 26% of the rate that could be extracted if used for anaerobic digestion involving return of recalcitrant carbon to fields (Hansen et al. 2020). Similarly, biomass pyrolysis produces biochar which can be returned to soils to counteract carbon losses associated with biomass extraction (Joseph et al. 2021; Lehmann et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Expansion of biomass crops, especially monocultures of exotic species, can pose risks to natural ecosystems and biodiversity through introduction of invasive species and land use change, also impacting the mitigation value (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Liu et al. 2014; El Akkari et al. 2018). Cultivation of conventional oil, sugar, and starch crops tends to have larger negative impact than lignocellulosic crops (Núñez-Regueiro et al. 2020). Social and environmental outcomes can be enhanced through integration of suitable plants (such as perennial grasses and short rotation woody crops) into agricultural landscapes (within crop rotations or through strategic localisation, for example as contour belts, along fencelines and riparian buffers). Such integrated systems can provide shelter for livestock, retention of nutrients and sediment, erosion control, pollination, pest and disease control, and flood regulation (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Berndes et al. 2008; Christen and Dalgaard 2013; Asbjornsen et al. 2014; Holland et al. 2015; Ssegane et al. 2015; Dauber and Miyake 2016; Milner et al. 2016; Ssegane and Negri 2016; Styles et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2016; Ferrarini et al. 2017; Crews et al. 2018; Henry et al. 2018a; Zalesny et al. 2019; Osorio et al. 2019; Englund et al. 2020b; Englund et al. 2021) (Figure 12.8, Box 12.3, and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this chapter). Many of the land use practices described above align with agroecology principles (AR6 WGII Section 5.1 4, AR6 WGII Box 5.11 and AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL) and can simultaneously contribute to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation and reduced risk of land degradation (IPCC 2019a) (robust evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"When A/R activities comprise the establishment of natural forests, the risk to land is primarily associated with potential displacement of previous land use to new locations, which could indirectly cause land-use change including deforestation (Sections 7.4.2 and 7.6.2.4). A/R (including agroforestry) aimed at providing timber, fibre, biomass, non-timber resources and other ecosystem services can provide renewable resources to society and long-term livelihoods for communities. Forest management and harvesting regimes around the world will adjust in different ways as society seeks to meet climate goals. The outcome depends on forest type, climate, forest ownership and the character and product portfolio of the associated forest industry (Lauri et al. 2019; Favero et al. 2020). How forest carbon stocks, biodiversity, hydrology, and so on are affected by changes in forest management and harvesting in turn depends on both management practices and the characteristics of the forest ecosystems (Eales et al. 2018; Griscom et al. 2018; Kondo et al. 2018; Nieminen et al. 2018; Thom et al. 2018; Runting et al. 2019; Tharammal et al. 2019) (robust evidence, medium agreement ). As described above, the GHG savings achieved from producing and using bio-based products will in addition depend on the character of existing societal systems, including technical infrastructure and markets, as this determines the product substitution patterns."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Environmental and socio-economic co-benefits are enhanced when ecological restoration principles are applied (Gann et al. 2019) along with effective planning at landscape level and strong governance (Morgan et al., 2020). For example, restoration of natural vegetation and establishing plantations on degraded land enable organic matter to accumulate in the soil and have potential to deliver significant co-benefits for biodiversity, land resource condition and livelihoods (Box 12.3 and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this chapter). Tree planting and agroforestry on cleared land can deliver biodiversity benefits (Seddon et al. 2009; Kavanagh and Stanton 2012; Law et al. 2014), with biodiversity outcomes influenced by block size, configuration and species mix (Cunningham et al. 2015; Paul et al. 2016) (robust evidence, high agreement )."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Biomass-based systems and A/R can contribute to addressing land degradation through land rehabilitation or restoration (Box 12.3). Land-based mitigation options that produce biomass for bioenergy/BECCS or biochar through land rehabilitation rather than land restoration imply a trade-off between production / carbon sequestration and biodiversity outcomes (Hua et al. 2016; Cowie et al. 2018). Restoration, seeking to establish native vegetation with the aim to maximise ecosystem integrity, landscape connectivity, and conservation of on-ground carbon stock, will have higher biodiversity benefits than rehabilitation measures (Lin et al. 2013). However, sequestration rate declines as forests mature, and the sequestered carbon is vulnerable to loss through disturbance such as wildfire, so there is a higher risk of reversal of the mitigation benefit compared with use of biomass for substitution of fossil fuels and GHG-intensive building materials (Russell and Kumar 2017; Dugan et al. 2018; Anderegg et al. 2020). Trade-offs between different ecosystem services, and between societal objectives including climate change mitigation and adaptation, can be managed through integrated landscape approaches that aim to create a mosaic of land uses, including conservation, agriculture, forestry and settlements (Freeman et al. 2015; Nielsen 2016; Reed et al. 2016; Sayer et al. 2017) where each is sited with consideration of land potential and socio-economic objectives and context (Cowie et al. 2018) (limited evidence, high agreement ). "
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Impacts of biomass production and A/R on the hydrological cycle and water availability and quality depend on scale, location, previous land use/cover and type of biomass production system. For example, extraction of logging residues in forests managed for timber production has little effect on hydrological flows, while land-use change to establish dedicated biomass production can have a significant effect (Teter et al. 2018; Drews et al. 2020). Deployment of A/R can affect temperature, albedo and precipitation locally and regionally, and can mitigate or enhance the effects of climate change in the affected areas (Stenzel et al. 2021b) (Section 7.2.4). A/R activities can increase evapotranspiration, impacting groundwater and downstream water availability, but can also result in increased infiltration to groundwater and improved water quality (Farley et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2018) and can be beneficial where historical clearing has caused soil salinisation and stream salinity (Farrington and Salama 1996; Marcar 2016). There is limited evidence that very large-scale land-use or vegetation cover changes can alter regional climate and precipitation patterns, for example downwind precipitation depends on upwind evapotranspiration from forests and other vegetation (Keys et al. 2016; Ellison et al. 2017; van der Ent and Tuinenburg 2017)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"Another example of beneficial effects includes perennial grasses and woody crops planted to intercept runoff and subsurface lateral flow, reducing nitrate entering groundwater and surface waterbodies (Femeena et al. 2018; Woodbury et al. 2018; Griffiths et al. 2019). In India, Garg et al. (2011) found desirable effects as a result of planting Jatropha on wastelands previously used for grazing (which could continue in the Jatropha plantations): soil evaporation was reduced, as a larger share of the rainfall was channelled to plant transpiration and groundwater recharge, and less runoff resulted in reduced soil erosion and improved downstream water conditions. Thus, adverse effects can be reduced and synergies achieved when plantings are sited carefully, with consideration of potential hydrological impacts (Davis et al. 2013)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p11,NO_TITLE,"Several biomass conversion technologies can generate co-benefits for land and water. Anaerobic digestion of organic wastes (e.g., food waste, manure) produces a nutrient-rich digestate and biogas that can be utilised for heating and cooking or upgraded for use in electricity generation, industrial processes, or as transportation fuel (Chapter 6) (Parsaee et al. 2019; Hamelin et al. 2021). The digestate is a rich source of nitrogen, phosphorus and other plant nutrients, and its application to farmland returns exported nutrients as well as carbon (Cowie 2020b). Studies have identified potential risks, including manganese toxicity, copper and zinc contamination, and ammonia emissions, compared with application of undigested animal manure (Nkoa 2014). Although the anaerobic digestion process reduces pathogen risk compared with undigested manure feedstocks, it does not destroy all pathogens (Nag et al. 2019). Leakage of methane is a significant risk that needs to be managed, to ensure mitigation potential is achieved (Bruun et al. 2014). Anaerobic digestion of wastewater, such as sugarcane vinasse, reduces methane emissions and pollution loading as well as producing biogas (Parsaee et al. 2019)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"Biorefineries can convert biomass to food, feed and biomaterials along with bioenergy (Aristizábal‐Marulanda and Cardona Alzate 2019; Schmidt et al. 2019). Biorefinery plants are commonly characterised by high process integration to achieve high resource use efficiency, minimise waste production and energy requirements, and maintain flexibility towards changing markets for raw materials and products (Schmidt et al. 2019). Emerging technologies can convert biomass that is indigestible for monogastric animals or humans (e.g., algae, grass, clover or alfalfa) into food and feed products. For example, lactic acid bacteria can facilitate the use of green plant biomass such as grasses and clover to produce a protein concentrate suitable for animal feed and other products for material or energy use (Lübeck and Lübeck 2019). Selection of crops suitable for co-production of protein feed along with biofuels and other bio-based products can significantly reduce the land conversion pressure by reducing the need to cultivate other crops (e.g., soybean) for animal feed (Bentsen and Møller 2017; Solati et al. 2018). Thus, such solutions, using alternatives to high-input, high-emissions grain-based feed, can enable sustainable intensification of agricultural systems with reduced environmental impacts (Jørgensen and Lærke 2016). The use of seaweed and algae as biorefinery feedstock can facilitate recirculation of nutrients from waters to agricultural land, thus reducing eutrophication while substituting purpose-grown feed (Thomas et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"Pyrolysis can convert organic wastes, including agricultural and forestry residues, food waste, manure, poultry litter and sewage sludge, into combustible gas and biochar, which can be used as a soil amendment (Joseph et al. 2021; Schmidt et al. 2021) (Chapter 7). Pyrolysis facilitates nutrient recovery from biomass residues, enabling return to farmland as biochar, noting, however, that a large fraction of nitrogen is lost during pyrolysis (Joseph et al. 2021). Conversion to biochar aids the logistics of transport and land application of materials such as sewage sludge, by reducing mass and volume, improving flow properties, stability and uniformity, and decreasing odour. Pyrolysis is well suited for materials that may be contaminated with pathogens, microplastics, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, such as abattoir and sewage wastes, removing these risks, and reduces availability of heavy metals in feedstock (Joseph et al. 2021). Applying biochar to soil sequesters biochar-carbon for hundreds to thousands of years and can further increase soil carbon by reducing mineralisation of soil organic matter and newly added plant carbon (Singh et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016a; Weng et al. 2017; Lehmann et al. 2021). Biochars can improve a range of soil properties, but effects vary depending on biochar properties, which are determined by feedstock and production conditions (Singh et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016a), and on the soil properties where biochar is applied (Razzaghi et al. 2020). Biochars can increase nutrient availability, reduce leaching losses (Singh et al. 2010; Haider et al. 2017) and enhance crop yields, particularly in infertile acidic soils (Jeffery et al. 2017), thus supporting food security under changing climate. Biochars can enhance infiltration and soil water-holding capacity, reducing runoff and leaching, increasing water retention in the landscape and improving drought tolerance and resilience to climate change (Quin et al. 2014; Omondi et al. 2016).

The highest increases in food insecurity due to deployment of land-based mitigation are expected to occur in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia (Hasegawa et al. 2018). The land area that could be used for bioenergy or other land-based mitigation options with low to moderate risks to food security depends on patterns of socio-economic development, reaching limits between 1 and 4 million km 2 (Hurlbert et al. 2019; IPCC 2019a; Smith et al. 2019c)."

The potential is however uncertain as biomass growth rates may be low, a variety of assessment approaches have been used, and the identification of degraded/marginal land as ‘available’ has been contested, as much low productivity land is used informally by impoverished communities, particularly for grazing, or may be economically infeasible or environmentally undesirable for development of energy crops (medium evidence, low agreement ) (Baka 2013; Fritz et al. 2013; Haberl et al. 2013; Baka 2014)."

Policies supporting the target of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) (SDG 15.3) encourage planning of measures to counteract loss of productive land due to unsustainable agricultural practices and land conversion, through sustainable land management and strategic restoration and rehabilitation of degraded land (Cowie et al. 2018). LDN can thus be an incentive for land-based mitigation measures that build carbon in vegetation and soil, and can provide impetus for land-use planning to achieve multifunctional landscapes that integrate land-based mitigation with other land uses (Box 12.3). The application of sustainable land management practices that build soil carbon will enhance the productivity and resilience of crop and forestry systems, thereby enhancing biomass production (Henry et al. 2018a). Non-bio-based mitigation options can enhance land-based mitigation: (i) enhanced weathering, that is, adding ground silicate rock to soil to take up atmospheric CO2 through chemical weathering (Section 12.3), could supply nutrients and alleviate soil acidity, thereby boosting productivity of biomass crops and A/R, particularly when combined with biochar application (Haque et al. 2019; De Oliveira Garcia et al. 2020; Buss et al. 2021); and (ii) land rehabilitation and enhanced landscape diversity through production of biomass crops could simultaneously contribute to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, addressing land degradation, increasing biodiversity and improving food security in the longer term (Mackey et al. 2020) (Chapter 7)."

Spatial planning and local stakeholder engagement can reduce opposition due to visual landscape impacts and noise (Frolova et al. 2019; Hevia-Koch and Ladenburg 2019).

Careful siting is critical (May et al. 2021), while painting blades to increase the visibility can also reduce mortality due to collision (May et al. 2020). Theoretical studies have suggested that wind turbines could lead to warmer night temperatures due to atmospheric mixing (Keith et al. 2004), later confirmed through observation (Zhou et al. 2013), although Vautard et al.

Establishment of large-scale solar farms could have positive or negative environmental effects at the site of deployment, depending on the location. Solar PV and CSP power installations can lock away land areas, displacing other uses (Mohan 2017). Solar PV can be deployed in ways that enhance agriculture: for example, Hassanpour Adeh et al. (2018) found that biomass production and water use efficiency of pasture increased under elevated solar panels. PV systems under development may achieve significant power generation without diminishing agricultural output (Miskin et al. 2019). Global mapping of solar panel efficiency showed that croplands, grasslands and wetlands are located in regions with the greatest solar PV potential (Adeh et al. 2019). Dual-use agrivoltaic systems are being developed that overcome previously recognised negative impact on crop growth, mainly due to shadows (Marrou et al. 2013a; Marrou et al. 2013b; Armstrong et al. 2016), thus facilitating synergistic co-location of solar photovoltaic power and cropping (Adeh et al. 2019; Miskin et al. 2019).

Negative impacts on aquatic systems can occur due to chemical and thermal pollution loading (Fricko et al. 2016; Raptis et al. 2016; Bonansea et al. 2020). The major risk to land from nuclear power is that a nuclear accident leads to radioactive contamination. An extreme example, the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, resulted in radioactive contamination across Europe. Most of the fallout concentrated in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, where some 125,000 km 2 of land (more than a third of which was in agricultural use) was contaminated. About 350,000 people were relocated away from these areas (IAEA 2006b; Sovacool 2008). About 116,000 people were permanently evacuated from the 4200 km Chernobyl exclusion zone (IAEA 2006a). New reactor designs with passive and enhanced safety systems reduce the risk of such accidents significantly (Section 6.4.2.4). An example of alternatives to land reclamation for productive purposes, a national biosphere reserve has been established around Chernobyl to conserve, enhance and manage carbon stocks and biodiversity (Deryabina et al. 2015; Ewing et al. 2016), although invertebrate and plant populations are affected (Mousseau and Møller 2014; Mousseau and Møller 2020)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p22,NO_TITLE,"Reservoir hydropower projects submerge areas as dams are established for water storage. Hydropower can be associated with significant and highly varying land occupation and carbon footprint (Poff and Schmidt 2016; Scherer and Pfister 2016a; dos Santos et al. 2017; Ocko and Hamburg 2019). The flooding of land causes CH4 emissions due to the anaerobic decomposition of submerged vegetation and there is also a loss of carbon sequestration due to mortality of submerged vegetation. The size of GHG emissions depends on the amount of vegetation submerged. The carbon in accumulated sediments in reservoirs may be released to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4 upon decommissioning of dams, and while uncertain, estimates indicate that these emissions can make up a significant part of the cumulative GHG emissions of hydroelectric power plants (Moran et al. 2018; Almeida et al. 2019; Ocko and Hamburg 2019). Positive radiative forcing due to lower albedo of hydropower reservoirs compared to surrounding landscapes can reduce mitigation contribution significantly (Wohlfahrt et al. 2021)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.3_p23,NO_TITLE,"Hydropower can have high water usage due to evaporation from dams (Scherer and Pfister 2016b). Hydropower projects may impact aquatic ecology and biodiversity, necessitate the relocation of local communities living within or near the reservoir or construction sites, and affect downstream communities (in positive or negative ways) (Moran et al. 2018; Barbarossa et al. 2020). Displacement as well as resettlement schemes can have both socio-economic and environmental consequences including those associated with establishment of new agricultural land (Ahsan and Ahmad 2016; Nguyen et al. 2017). Dam construction may also stimulate migration into the affected region, which can lead to deforestation and other negative impacts (Chen et al. 2015 ). Impacts can be mitigated through basin-scale dam planning that considers GHG emissions along with social and ecological effects (Almeida et al. 2019). Land occupation is minimal for run-of-river hydropower installations, but without storage they have no resilience to drought and installations inhibit dispersal and migration of organisms (Lange et al. 2018). Reservoir hydropower schemes can regulate water flows and reduce flood damage to agricultural production (Amjath-Babu et al. 2019). On the other hand, severe flooding due to failure of hydropower dams has caused fatalities, damage to infrastructure and loss of productive land (Farrington and Salama 1996; Farley et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2016; Marcar 2016; Zhang et al. 2017; Kalinina et al. 2018; Lu et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch12_12.5.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The land sector (Chapter 7) contributes to mitigation via emissions reduction and enhancement of land carbon sinks, and by providing biomass for mitigation in other sectors. Key challenges for governance of land-based mitigation include social and environmental safeguards (Duchelle et al. 2017; Sills et al. 2017; Larson et al. 2018); insufficient financing (Turnhout et al. 2017); capturing co-benefits; ensuring additionality; addressing non-permanence of carbon sequestration; monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removals; and avoiding leakage or spillover effects. Governance approaches to addressing these challenges are discussed in Section 7.6, and include MRV systems and integrity criteria for project-level emissions trading; payments for ecosystem services; land-use planning and land zoning; certification schemes, standards and codes of practice."
wg3_ch12_12.5.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"With respect to renewable energy options that occupy land, the focus of governance has been directed to technological adoption and public acceptance (Sequeira and Santos 2018), rather than land use. Recent work has found that spatial processes shape the emerging energy transition, creating zones of friction between global investors, national and local governments, and civil society (Jepson and Caldas 2017; McEwan 2017). For example, Yenneti et al. (2016) have argued that hydropower and ground-based solar parks in India, which have involved enclosure of lands designated as degraded, displacing pastoral use by vulnerable communities, have constituted forms of spatial injustice. Hydropower leads to dam-induced displacement, and though this can be addressed through compensation mechanisms, governance is complicated by a lack of transparency in resettlement data (Kirchherr et al. 2016; Kirchherr et al. 2019). Renewable energy production is resulting in new land conflict frontiers where degraded land is framed as having mitigation value such as for palm oil production and wind power in Mexico (Backhouse and Lehmann 2020); land use conflict as well as impacts on wildlife from large-scale solar installations have also emerged in the southwestern United States (Mulvaney 2017). The renewable energy transition also involves the extraction of critical minerals used in renewable energy technologies, such as lithium and cobalt. Governance challenges include the lack of transparent greenhouse gas accounting for mining activities (Lee et al. 2020a), and threats to biodiversity from land disturbance, which require strategic planning to address (Sonter et al. 2020a). Strategic spatial planning is needed more generally to address trade-offs between using land for renewable energy and food: for example, agriculture can be co-located with solar photovoltaics (Barron-Gafford et al. 2019) or wind power (Miller and Keith 2018a). Integrative spatial planning can integrate renewable energy with not just agriculture, but mobility and housing (Hurlbert et al. 2019). Integrated planning is needed to avoid scalar pitfalls, and local and regional contextualised governance solutions need to be sited within a planetary frame of reference (Biermann et al. 2016). Greater planning and coordination are also needed to ensure co-benefits from land-based mitigation (Box 12.3) as well as from CDR and efforts to reduce food systems emissions."
wg3_ch12_12.5.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"In emerging domains for governance such as land-based mitigation, global institutions, private sector networks and civil society organisations are playing key roles in terms of norm-setting. The shared languages and theoretical frameworks, or cognitive linkages (Pattberg et al. 2018), that arise with polycentric governance can not only be helpful in creating expectations and establishing benchmarks for (in)appropriate practices where enforceable ‘hard law’ is missing (Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al. 2018; Gajevic Sayegh 2020), they can also form the basis of voluntary guidelines or niche markets (Box 12.3) However, the ability to apply participatory processes for developing voluntary guidelines and other participatory norm-setting endeavours varies from place to place. Social and cultural norms shape the ability of women, youth, and different ethnic groups to participate in governance fora, such as those around agroecological transformation (Anderson et al. 2019). Furthermore, establishing new norms alone does not solve structural challenges such as lack of access to food, nor does it confront power imbalances, or provide mechanisms to deal with uncooperative actors (Morrison et al. 2019)."

This section builds on the sectoral analysis of mitigation action from a cross-sectoral perspective. Firstly, Section 12.6.1.1 brings together some of the observations presented in the sectoral chapters to show how different mitigation actions in different sectors can contribute to the same co-benefits and result in the same adverse side effects, thereby demonstrating the potential synergistic effects. The links between these co-benefits and adverse side effects and the SDGs is also demonstrated. In Section 12.6.1.2, the focus turns from sector-specific mitigation measures to mitigation measures which have cross-sectoral implications, including measures that have application in more than one sector and measures where implementation in one sector impacts on implementation in another. Finally, Section 12.6.1.3 notes the cross-sectoral relevance of a selection of general-purpose technologies, a topic that is covered further in Chapter 16."

The term ‘co-impacts’ has been proposed to capture both the co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation. An alternative framing is one of multiple objectives, where climate change mitigation is placed alongside other objectives when assessing policy decisions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014; Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016; Cohen et al. 2017; Bhardwaj et al. 2019)."

Assessment of adverse side effects has been suggested to be useful in avoiding unforeseen negative impacts of mitigation and providing policy- and decision-makers with the information required to make informed trade-offs between climate and other benefits of actions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014; Bhardwaj et al. 2019; Cohen et al. 2019) ( high evidence, low agreement )."

This challenge is further exacerbated when considering that co-impacts of a mitigation measure in one sector can either enhance or reduce the co-impacts associated with mitigation in another, or the achievement of co-benefits in one geographic location can lead to adverse side effects in another. For example, the production of lithium for batteries for energy storage has the potential to contribute to protecting water resources and reducing wastes associated with coal-fired power in many parts of the world, but mining of lithium has the potential for creating water and waste challenges if not managed properly (Agusdinata et al. 2018; Kaunda 2020)."

Renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind may be used for grid electricity supply, as embedded generation in the buildings sector and for energy supply in the agriculture sector (Shahsavari and Akbari 2018) (Chapters 6, 7 and 8). Hydrogen and fuel cells, coupled with low-carbon energy technologies for producing the hydrogen, are being explored in transport, urban heat, industry and for balancing electricity supply (Dodds et al. 2015; Staffell et al. 2019) (Chapters 6, 8 and 11). Electric vehicles are considered an option for balancing variable power (Kempton and Tomić 2005; Liu and Zhong 2019). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) have potential application in a number of industrial processes (cement, iron and steel, petroleum refining and pulp and paper) (Leeson et al. 2017; Garcia and Berghout 2019) (Chapters 6 and 11) and the fossil fuel electricity sector (Chapter 6). When coupled with energy recovery from biomass, CCS can provide a carbon sink (BECCS) (Section 12.5).

wg3_ch12_12.6.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"A range of examples where mitigation measures result in cross-sectoral interactions and integration is identified. The mitigation potential of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, is linked to the extent of decarbonisation of the electricity grid, as well as to the liquid fuel supply emissions profile (Lutsey 2015). Making buildings energy positive, where excess energy is used to charge vehicles, can increase the potential of electric and hybrid vehicles (Zhou et al. 2019). Advanced process control and process optimisation in industry can reduce energy demand and material inputs (Section 11.3), which in turn can reduce emissions linked to resource extraction and manufacturing. Reductions in coal-fired power generation through replacement with renewables or nuclear power result in a reduction in coal mining and its associated emissions. Increased recycling results in a reduction in emissions from primary resource extraction. CCU can contribute to the transition to more renewable energy systems via power-to-X technologies, which enables the production of CO2-based fuels/e-fuels and chemicals using carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Breyer et al. 2015; Anwar et al. 2020). Certain emissions reductions in the AFOLU sector are contingent on energy sector decarbonisation. Trees and green roofs planted to counter urban heat islands reduce the demand for energy for air conditioning and simultaneously sequester carbon (Kim and Coseo 2018; Kuronuma et al. 2018). Recycling of organic waste avoids methane generation if the waste would have been disposed of in landfill sites, can generate renewable energy if treated through anaerobic digestion, and can reduce requirements for synthetic fertiliser production if the nutrient value is recovered (Creutzig et al. 2015). Liquid transport biofuels link to the land, energy and transport sectors (Section 12.5.2.2)."

Production of maize, wheat, rice and fresh produce requires lower energy inputs on a lifecycle basis than poultry, pork and ruminant-based meats (Clark and Tilman 2017) (Section 12.4). It also requires less land area per kilocalorie or protein output (Clark and Tilman 2017; Poore and Nemecek 2018), so replacing meat with these products makes land available for sequestration, biodiversity or other societal needs.

wg3_ch12_12.6.1.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"Finally, in terms of competition among sectors for scarce resources, this issue is often considered in the assessments of mitigation potentials linked to bioenergy and diets (vegetable vs animal food products), land use and water (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Section 12.5 and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this Chapter). It is, however, also relevant elsewhere. Constraints have been identified in the supply of indium, tellurium, silver, lithium, nickel and platinum that are required for implementation of some specific renewable energy technologies (Watari et al. 2018; Moreau et al. 2019). Other studies have shown constraints in supply of cobalt, one of the key elements used in production of lithium-ion batteries, which has been assessed for mitigation potential in energy, transport and buildings sectors (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Jaffe 2017; Olivetti et al. 2017), although alternatives to cobalt are being developed (Olivetti et al. 2017; Watari et al. 2018)."
wg3_ch12_12.6.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"General-purpose technologies (GPTs) include, but are not limited to, additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, hydrogen, digitalisation, electrification, nanotechnology and robots (de Coninck et al. 2018). Many of the individual sectoral chapters have identified the roles that such technologies can have in supporting mitigation of GHG emissions. Section 16.2.2.3 presents an overview of the individual technologies and specific applications thereof."
wg3_ch12_12.6.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"In this chapter, which focuses on cross-sectoral implications of mitigation, it is highlighted that certain of these GPTs will find application across the sectors, and there will be synergies and trade-offs when utilising these technologies in more than sector. One example here is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, which, when coupled with low-carbon energy, has potential for driving mitigation in energy, industry, transport, and buildings. The increased uptake of hydrogen across the economy requires establishment of hydrogen production, transport and storage infrastructure which could simultaneously support multiple sectors, although there is the potential to utilise existing infrastructure in some parts of the world (Alanne and Cao 2017).  "
wg3_ch12_12.6.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Box 12.5 provides further details on hydrogen in the context of cross-sectoral mitigation specifically, while further details on the role of hydrogen in individual sectors are provided in Chapters 6, 8. 9, 10 and 11. In contrast, the benefits of digitalisation, which could potentially give rise to substantial energy savings across multiple sectors, need to be traded off against demand for electricity to operate consumer devices, data centres, and data networks. Measures are required to increase energy efficiency of these technologies (IEA 2017). Section 5.3.4.1 of this report provides further information on energy and emissions benefits and costs of digitalisation."
wg3_ch12_12.6.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"With respect to co-impacts of GPTs, the other focus of this chapter, it is highlighted that assessment of the environmental, social and economic implications of such technologies is challenging and context specific, with multiple potential cross-sectoral linkages (de Coninck et al. 2018). Each GPT would need to be explored in context of what it is being used for, and potentially in the geographical context, in order to understand the co-impacts of its use."
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"A taxonomy of policy types and attributes is provided by Section 13.6. In addition, the sectoral chapters provide an in-depth discussion of important mitigation policy issues such as policy overlaps, policy mixes, and policy interaction as well as policy design considerations and governance. The point of departure for the assessment in this chapter is a focus on cross-sectoral perspectives aiming at maximising policy synergies and minimising policy trade-offs."
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Synergies and trade-offs resulting from mitigation policies are not clearly discernible from either sector-level studies or global and regional top-down studies. Rather, they would require a cross-sectoral integrated policy framework (von Stechow et al. 2015; Monier et al. 2018; Pardoe et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2019) or multiple-objective-multiple-impact policy assessment framework identifying key co-impacts and avoiding trade-offs (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014). "
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Sectoral studies typically cover differentiated response measures while the IAM literature mostly uses uniform efficient market-based measures. This has important implications for understanding the differences in magnitude and distribution of mitigation costs and potentials of Section 12.2 (Karplus et al. 2013; Rausch and Karplus 2014). There is a comprehensive literature on the efficiency of uniform carbon pricing compared to sector-specific mitigation approaches, but relatively less literature on the distributional impacts of carbon taxes and measures to mitigate potential adverse distributional impacts (Rausch and Karplus 2014; Rausch and Reilly 2015; Wang et al. 2016b; Åhman et al. 2017; Mu et al. 2018). For example, in terms of cross-sectoral distributional implications, studies find negative competitiveness impacts for the energy-intensive industries (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Rausch and Karplus 2014; Wang et al. 2016b; Åhman et al. 2017)."
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Strong interdependencies and cross-sectoral linkages create both opportunities for synergies and the need to address trade-offs. This calls for coordinated sectoral approaches to climate change mitigation policies that mainstream these interactions (Pardoe et al. 2018). Such an approach is also called for in the context of cross-sectoral interactions of adaptation and mitigation measures, examples are in the agriculture, biodiversity, forests, urban, and water sectors (Arent et al. 2014; Berry et al. 2015; Di Gregorio et al. 2017). Integrated planning and cross-sectoral alignment of climate change policies are particularly evident in developing countries’ NDCs pledged under the Paris Agreement, where key priority sectors such as agriculture and energy are closely aligned between the proposed mitigation and adaptation actions in the context of sustainable development and the SDGs. An example is the integration between climate-smart agriculture and low-carbon energy (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018; England et al. 2018). Yet, there appear to be significant challenges relating to institutional capacity and resources to coordinate and implement such cross-sectoral policy alignment, particularly in developing country contexts (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018). "
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Another dimension of climate change policy interactions in the literature is related to trade-offs and synergies between climate change mitigation and other societal objectives. For example, in mitigation policies related to energy, trade-offs and synergies between universal electricity access and climate change mitigation would call for complementary policies such as pro-poor tariffs, fuel subsidies, and broadly integrated policy packages (Dagnachew et al. 2018). In agriculture and forestry, research suggests that integrated policy programmes enhance mitigation potentials across the land-use-agriculture-forestry nexus and lead to synergies and positive spillovers (Galik et al. 2019). To maximise synergies and deal with trade-offs in such a cross-sectoral context, evidence-based/informed and holistic policy analysis approaches like nexus approaches and multi-target back-casting approaches that take into account unanticipated outcomes and indirect consequences would be needed (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Klausbruckner et al. 2016; Hoff et al. 2019; van der Voorn et al. 2020) (Box 12.6). "
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"The consequences of large-scale land-based mitigation for food security, biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021), the state of soil, water resources, and so on can be significant, depending on many factors, such as economic development (including distributional aspects), international trade patterns, agronomic development, diets, land-use governance and policy design, and not least climate change itself (Winchester and Reilly 2015; Fujimori et al. 2018; Hasegawa et al. 2018; Van Meijl et al. 2018). Policies and regulations that address other aspects apart from climate change can indirectly influence the attractiveness of land-based mitigation options. For example, farmers may find it attractive to shift from annual food/feed crops to perennial grasses and short rotation woody crops (suitable for bioenergy) if the previous land uses become increasingly restricted due to impacts on groundwater quality and eutrophication of water bodies (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Sections 12.4 and 12.5)."
wg3_ch12_12.6.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Finally, there are knowledge gaps in the literature particularly in relation to policy scalability and the extent and magnitude of policy interactions when scaling the policy to a level consistent with low GHG emissions pathways such as 2°C and 1.5°C."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3_p1, Cross-sectoral Aspects of Carbon Leakage ,"International spillovers of mitigation policies are effects that carbon-abatement measures implemented in one country have on sectors in other countries. These effects include (i) carbon leakage in manufacture; (ii) the effects on energy trade flows and incomes related to fossil fuel exports from major exporters; (iii) technology and knowledge spillovers; and (iv) transfer of norms and preferences via various approaches to establish sustainability requirements on traded goods, such as EU-RED and environmental labelling systems to guide consumer choices (robust evidence, medium agreement ). This section focuses on cross-sectoral aspects of international spillovers related to the first two effects."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Carbon leakage occurs when mitigation measures implemented in one country or sector lead to a rise in emissions in other countries or sectors. Three types of spillovers are possible: (i) domestic cross-sectoral spillovers when mitigation policy in one sector leads to the re-allocation of labour and capital towards the other sectors of the same country; (ii) international spillovers within a single sector when mitigation policy leads to substitution of domestic production of carbon-intensive goods with their imports from abroad; and (iii) international cross-sectoral spillovers when mitigation policy in one sector in one country leads to the rise in emissions in other sectors in other countries. While the first two are described in Section 13.6, this section focuses on the third. Though some papers address this type of leakage, there is still a significant lack of knowledge on this topic."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,One possible channel of cross-sectoral international carbon leakage is through global value chains. Mitigation policy in one country not only leads to shifts in competitiveness across industries producing final goods but also across those producing raw materials and intermediary goods all over the world.
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"This type of leakage is especially important because the countries that provide basic materials are usually emerging or developing economies, many of which have no or limited regulation of GHG emissions. For this reason, foreign direct investment in developing economies usually leads to an increase in emissions (Kivyiro and Arminen 2014; Shahbaz et al. 2015; Bakhsh et al. 2017): in the case of basic materials the effect of expansion of economic activity on emissions exceeds the effect of technological spillovers, while for developed countries the effect is opposite (Shahbaz et al. 2015; Pazienza 2019). Meng et al. (2018) calculated that environmental cost for generating one unit of GDP through international trade was 1.4 times higher than that through domestic production in 1995. By 2009, this difference increased to 1.8 times. Carbon leakage due to the differences in environmental regulation was the main driver of this increase."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"In order to address emissions leakage through global value chains, Liu and Fan (2017) propose the value-added-based emissions accounting principle, which makes it possible to account for GHG emissions within the context of the economic benefit principle. Davis et al. (2011) notice that the analysis of value chains gives an opportunity to find the point where regulation would be the most efficient and the least vulnerable to leakage. For instance, transaction costs of global climate policy and the risks of leakage may be reduced if emissions are regulated at the extraction stage as there are far fewer agents involved in this process than in burning of fossil fuels or consumption of energy-intensive goods. Li et al. (2020) calls for coordinated efforts to reduce emissions embodied in trade flows in pairs of the economies with the highest leakage, such as China and the United States, China and Germany, China and Japan, Russia and Germany."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Unfortunately, these proposals either face difficulties in collection and verification of data on emissions along value chains or require a high level of international cooperation, which is hardly achievable at the moment. Neuhoff et al. (2016) and Pollitt et al. (2020) focus on the regulation of emissions embodied in global value chains through national policy instruments. They propose implementation of a charge on consumption of imported basic materials into the European emissions trading system. Such a charge, equivalent to around EUR80 tCO2–1, could reduce the EU’s total CO2 emissions by up to 10% by 2050 (Pollitt et al. 2020) without significant effects on competitiveness. This proposal is very close to the carbon border adjustment introduced in the EU and described in more detail in Sections 13.2 and 13.6."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Cross-sectoral effects of carbon leakage also occur through the multiplier effect, when the mitigation policy in any sector in country A leads to the increase of relative competitiveness and therefore production of the same sector in country B, which automatically leads to the expansion of economic activity in other sectors of country B. This expansion may in turn lead to the rise of production and emissions in country A as a result of feedback effects. These spillovers should be taken into consideration while designing climate policy, along with potential synergies that may appear due to joint efforts. However, the scale of these effects with regards to leakage should not be overestimated. Even for intrasectoral leakage, many ex ante modelling studies generally suggest limited carbon leakage rates (Chapter 13). Intersectoral leakage should be even less significant. Interregional spillover and feedback effects are well studied in China (Zhang 2017; Ning et al. 2019). Even within a single country, interregional spillover effects are much lower than intraregional effects, and feedback effects are even less intense. Cross-sectoral spillovers across national borders as a result of mitigation policy should be even smaller, although these are less well studied. In future, if the differences in carbon price between regions increase, leakage through cross-sectoral multipliers may play a more important role."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Another important cross-sectoral aspect of carbon leakage concerns the transport sector. If mitigation policy leads to the substitution of domestic carbon-intensive production with imports, one of the side effects of this substitution is the rise of emissions from transportation of imported goods. International transport is responsible for about a third of worldwide trade-related emissions, and over 75% of emissions for major manufacturing categories (Cristea et al. 2013). Carbon leakage would potentially increase the emissions from transportation significantly as the trade of major consuming economies of the EU and US would shift towards distant trading partners in East and South Asia. Meng et al. (2018) consider more distant transportation as one of the major contributors to the rise in emissions embodied in international trade from 1995 to 2009."

However, it does not mean that disruption of trade would reduce global emissions. Zhang et al. (2020) show that deglobalisation and the drop in international trade may result in emissions reductions in the short term, but in the longer term it will make each country build more complete industrial systems to satisfy their final demand, although they have comparative disadvantages in some production stages. As a result, emissions would increase. According to Zhang et al. (2020), for China, the decrease of the degree of global value chain participation (which ranges from 0 to 1) by 0.1 would lead to an increase in gross carbon intensity of China’s exports of 11.7%. On distributional implications, Parrado and De Cian (2014) report that trade-driven spillover effects transmitted through imports of materials and equipment result in significant inter-sectoral distributional effects, with some sectors witnessing substantial expansion in activity and emissions and others witnessing a decline in activities and emissions."

Studies also make a distinction between a ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ green paradox (Gerlagh 2011).

With respect to the latter, support for renewable electricity has a lower green paradox than support for biofuels (Michielsen 2014; Gronwald et al. 2017). The existence of the green paradox is an additional argument in favour of more decisive climate policy now: any postponements will lead to additional consumption of fossil fuels and consequently the need for more ambitious and costly efforts in future."
wg3_ch12_12.6.3.2_p7,NO_TITLE,The effect of fossil fuel production expansion as a result of anticipated climate policy may be compensated by the effect of divestment.

The case of Russia is one of the most illustrative. Makarov et al. (2020) show that the fulfilment by Paris Agreement Parties of their NDCs would lead to 25% reduction of Russia’s energy exports by 2030 with significant reduction of its economic growth rates. At the same time, the domestic consumption of fossil fuels is anticipated to increase in response to the drop in external demand that would provoke carbon leakage (Orlov and Aaheim 2017).

Emissions-reduction measures lead to decreasing demand for fossil fuels and consequently to the decrease in exports from major oil- and gas-exporting countries. The case of Russia is one of the most illustrative. Makarov et al. (2020) show that the fulfilment by Paris Agreement Parties of their NDCs would lead to 25% reduction of Russia’s energy exports by 2030 with significant reduction of its economic growth rates. At the same time, the domestic consumption of fossil fuels is anticipated to increase in response to the drop in external demand that would provoke carbon leakage (Orlov and Aaheim 2017). Such spillovers demonstrate the need for dialogue between exporters and importers of fossil fuels while implementing the mitigation policies."
wg3_ch12_12.6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Finance is a principal enabler of GHG mitigation and an essential component of countries’ NDC packages submitted under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2016). The assessment of investment requirements for mitigation along with their financing at sectoral levels are addressed in detail by sectoral chapters while the assessment of financial sources, instruments, and the overall mitigation financing gap is addressed by Chapter 15 (Sections 15.3, 15.4, and 15.5). The focus in this chapter with respect to finance is on the scope and potential for financing integrated solutions that create synergies between and among sectors."
wg3_ch12_12.6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Cross-sectoral considerations in mitigation finance are critical for the effectiveness of mitigation action as well as for balancing the often conflicting social, developmental and environmental policy goals at the sectoral level. True measures of mitigation policy impacts and hence plans for resource mobilisation that properly address costs and benefits cannot be developed in isolation from their cross-sectoral implications. Unaddressed cross-sectoral coordination and interdependency issues are identified as major constraints in raising the necessary financial resources for mitigation in a number of countries (Bazilian et al. 2011; Welsch et al. 2014; Hoff et al. 2019a)."
wg3_ch12_12.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Integrated financial solutions to leverage synergies between sectors, as opposed to purely sector-based financing, at international, national, and local levels are needed to scale up GHG mitigation potentials. At the international level, finance from multilateral development banks (MDBs) is a major source of GHG mitigation finance in developing countries (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (World Bank Group 2015; Ha et al. 2016; Bhattacharya et al. 2016; Bhattacharya et al. 2018). In 2018, MDBs reported a total of USD30.165 billion in financial commitments to climate change mitigation, with 71% of total mitigation finance being committed through investment loans and the rest in the form of equity, guarantees, and other instruments. GHG reduction activities eligible for MDB finance are limited to those compatible with low-emission pathways recognising the importance of long-term structural changes, such as the shift in energy production to low-carbon energy technologies and the modal shift to low-carbon modes of transport leveraging both greenfield and energy efficiency projects. Sector-wise, the MDBs’ mitigation finance for 2018 is allocated to renewable energy (29%), transport (18%), energy efficiency (18%), lower-carbon and efficient energy generation (7%), agriculture, forestry and land use (8%), waste and wastewater (8%), and other sectors (12%) (MDB 2019). Unfortunately, due to institutional and incentives issues, MDB finance has mostly focused on sectoral solutions and has not been able to properly leverage cross-sectoral synergies. At the national level, applied research has shown that integrated modelling of land, energy and water resources not only has the potential to identify superior solutions, but also reveals important differences in terms of investment requirements and required financing arrangements compared to the traditional sectoral financing toolkits (Welsch et al. 2014). Agriculture, forestry, nature-based solutions and other forms of land use are promising sectors for leveraging financing solutions to scale up GHG mitigation efforts (Section 15.4). Moving to more productive and resilient forms of land use is a complex task, given the cross-cutting nature of land use, which necessarily results in apparent trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation, and development objectives. Finance is one area to manage these trade-offs where there may be opportunities to redirect the hundreds of billions spent annually on land use around the world towards green activities, without sacrificing either productivity or economic development (Falconer et al. 2015). Nonetheless, that would require active public support in design of land-use mitigation and adaptation strategies, coordination between public and private instruments across land use sectors, and leveraging of policy and financial instruments to redirect finance toward greener land-use practices (limited evidence, medium agreement ). For example, the Welsch et al. (2014) study on Mauritius shows that the promotion of a local biofuel industry from sugar cane could be economically favourable in the absence of water constraints, leading to a reduction in petroleum imports and GHG emissions while enhancing energy security. Yet, under a water-constrained scenario as a result of climate change, the need for additional energy to expand irrigation to previously rain-fed sugar plantations and to power desalination plants yields the opposite result in terms of GHG emissions and energy costs, making biofuels a sub-optimal option, and negatively affects their economics and the prospects for financing."
wg3_ch12_12.6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"At the local level, integrated planning and financing are needed to achieve more sustainable outcomes. For example, at a city level, integration is needed across sectors such as transport, energy systems, buildings, sewage and solid waste to optimise emissions footprints. How a city is designed will affect transportation demands, which makes it either more or less difficult to implement efficient public transportation, leading in turn to more or fewer emissions. Under such cases, solutions in terms of public and private investment paths and financing policies based on purely internal sector considerations are bound to cause adverse impacts on other sectors and poor overall outcomes (Gouldson et al. 2016)."
wg3_ch12_12.6.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Availability and access to finance are among the major barriers to GHG emissions mitigation across various sectors and technology options (robust evidence, high agreement ). Resource maturity mismatches and risk exposure are two main factors limiting ability of commercial banks and other private lenders to contribute to green finance (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2018). At all levels, mobilising the necessary resources to leverage cross-sectoral mitigation synergies would require the combination of public and private financial sources (Jensen and Dowlatabadi 2018). Traditional public financing would be required to synergise mitigation across sectors where the risk-return and time profiles of investment are not sufficiently attractive for the business sector. Over the years, private development financing through public-private partnerships and other related variants has been a growing source of finance to leverage cross-sectoral synergies and manage trade-offs (Anbumozhi and Timilsina 2018; Attridge and Engen 2019; Ishiwatari et al. 2019). Promoting such blended approaches to finance along with result-based financing architectures to strengthen delivery institutions are advocated as effective means to mainstream cross-sectoral mitigation finance (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Attridge and Engen 2019; Ishiwatari et al. 2019). The World Bank group and the International Financial Corporation have used the blended finance results-based approach to climate financing that addresses institutional, infrastructure, and service needs across sectors targeting developing countries and marginalised communities (GPRBA 2019; IDA 2019)."
wg3_ch12_12.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Finally, the literature review and analysis in Chapter 12 has taken account of the post-AR5 literature available and accessible to the chapter authors.

wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.1 | 	How could new technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere contribute to climate change mitigation?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Limiting the increase in warming to well below 2°C, and achieving net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, will require anthropogenic CO2 removal from  the atmosphere."
wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.1 | 	How could new technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere contribute to climate change mitigation?_p2,NO_TITLE,"The carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods studied so far have different removal potentials, costs, co-benefits and side effects. Some biological methods for achieving CDR, like afforestation/reforestation or wetland restoration, have long been practised. If implemented well, these practices can provide a range of co-benefits, but they can also have adverse side effects such as biodiversity loss or food price increases. Other chemical and geochemical approaches to CDR include direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering or ocean alkalinity enhancement. They are generally less vulnerable to reversal than biological methods."
wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.1 | 	How could new technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere contribute to climate change mitigation?_p3,NO_TITLE,"DACCS uses chemicals that bind to CO2 directly from the air; the CO2 is then removed from the sorbent and stored underground or mineralised. Enhanced weathering involves the mining of rocks containing minerals that naturally absorb CO2 from the atmosphere over geological timescales, which are crushed to increase the surface area and spread on soils (or elsewhere) where they absorb atmospheric CO2. Ocean alkalinity enhancement involves the extraction, processing, and dissolution of minerals and addition to the ocean where they enhance sequestration of CO2 as bicarbonate and carbonate ions in the ocean."
"wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.2 | 	Why is it important to assess mitigation measures from a systemic perspective, rather than only looking at their potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions?_p1",NO_TITLE,"Mitigation measures do not only reduce GHGs, but have wider impacts. They can result in decreases or increases in GHG emissions in another sector or part of the value chain from where they are applied. They can have wider environmental (e.g., air and water pollution, biodiversity), social (e.g., employment creation, health) and economic (e.g., growth, investment) co-benefits or adverse side effects. Mitigation and adaptation can also be linked. Taking these considerations into account can help to enhance the benefits of mitigation action, and avoid unintended consequences, as well as provide a stronger case for achieving political and societal support and raising the finances required for implementation."
wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.3 | 	Why do we need a food systems approach for assessing GHG emissions and mitigation opportunities from food systems?_p1,NO_TITLE,"Activities associated with the food system caused about one-third of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2015, distributed across all sectors. Agriculture and fisheries produce crops and animal-source food, which are partly processed in the food industry, packed, distributed, retailed, cooked, and finally eaten. Each step is associated with resource use, waste generation, and GHG emissions."
wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.3 | 	Why do we need a food systems approach for assessing GHG emissions and mitigation opportunities from food systems?_p2,NO_TITLE,A food systems approach helps identify critical areas as well as novel and alternative approaches to mitigation on both the supply side and the demand side of the food system. But complex co-impacts need to be considered and mitigation measures tailored to the specific context. International cooperation and governance of global food trade can support both mitigation and adaptation.
wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.3 | 	Why do we need a food systems approach for assessing GHG emissions and mitigation opportunities from food systems?_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is large scope for emissions reduction in both cropland and grazing production, and also in food processing, storage and distribution. Emerging options such as plant-based alternatives to animal food products and food from cellular agriculture are receiving increasing attention, but their mitigation potential is still uncertain and depends on the GHG intensity of associated energy systems due to relatively high energy needs. Diet changes can reduce GHG emissions and also improve health in groups with excess consumption of calories and animal food products, which is mainly prevalent in developed countries. Reductions in food loss and waste can help reduce GHG emissions further."
wg3_ch12_FAQ 12.3 | 	Why do we need a food systems approach for assessing GHG emissions and mitigation opportunities from food systems?_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recommendations to buy local food and avoid packaging can contribute to reducing GHG emissions but should not be generalised, as trade-offs exist with food waste, GHG footprint at farm gate, and accessibility to diverse healthy diets."
