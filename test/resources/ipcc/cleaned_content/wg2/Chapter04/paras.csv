wg2_ch04_4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Water security is defined as ‘the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability’ (Grey and Sadoff, 2007). Risks emanating from various aspects of water insecurity have emerged as a significant global challenge. The Global Risks Report by the World Economic Forum lists water crisis as one of the top five risks in all its reports since 2015 (WEF, 2015; WEF, 2016; WEF, 2017; WEF, 2018; WEF, 2019; WEF, 2020). Water also features prominently in the SDGs (Section 4.8) and plays a central role in various systems transitions needed for climate resilient development. Most SDGs cannot be met without access to adequate and safe water (Ait-Kadi, 2016; Mugagga, 2016). In addition, without adequate adaptation, future water-related impacts of climate change on various sectors of the economy are projected to lower the global GDP by mid-century, with higher projected losses expected in low- and middle-income countries (World Bank, 2017; GCA, 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are at least four reasons for the centrality of water security in adapting to, and mitigating climate change."
wg2_ch04_4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"First, approximately half the world’s population (~4 billion out of ~8 billion people) are assessed as being currently subject to severe water scarcity for at least some part fo the year (medium confidence) due to climatic and non-climate factors (Box 4.1). Water insecurity arises from many factors, both environmental and societal. Environmental factors include too little freshwater due to drought or pollution, and too much water, due to extreme precipitation and flooding, and are being affected by climate change. Societal factors include economic and governance-related barriers to water access or protection from water-related damages. Currently, many people are experiencing climate change on a day-to-day basis through water-related impacts such as the increased frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation (high confidence) (Section 4.2.1.1, Seneviratne et al., 2021 ); accelerated melting of glaciers (high confidence) (Section 4.2.2, Douville et al., 2021); changes in frequency, magnitude and timing of floods (high confidence) (Section 4.2.4, Seneviratne et al., 2021 ); more frequent and severe droughts in some places (high confidence) (Section 4.2.5, Seneviratne et al., 2021); decline in groundwater storage and reduction in recharge (medium confidence) (Section 4.2.6, Douville et al., 2021) and water quality deterioration due to extreme events (medium confidence) (Section 4.2.7). For example, since the 1970s, 44% of all disaster events have been flood-related (WMO, 2020). With the added stressor of climate change, globally, a larger fraction of land and population are projected to face increased water scarcity due to climate change. For example, at an approximately 2°C GWL, between 0.9 and 3.9 billion people are projected to be at increased exposure to water stress, depending on regional patterns of climate change and the socioeconomic scenarios considered (Koutroulis et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Second, while climate change directly affects freshwater availability across space and time, it also affects water requirements for different uses, such as irrigation, potentially adding to existing societal challenges (Bijl et al., 2018). Vulnerability to water-related impacts of climate change and extreme weather are already felt in all major sectors and are projected to intensify in the future, for example, in agriculture (high confidence) (Sections 4.3.1, 4.5.1); energy and industry (high confidence for observed drought impacts and projected impacts) (Sections 4.3.2, 4.5.2); water for health and sanitation (high confidence about links to precipitation extremes and disease outbreaks) (Sections 4.3.3, 4.5.3); water for urban, peri-urban and municipal sectors (medium confidence) (Sections 4.3.4, 4.5.4) and freshwater ecosystems (high confidence in climate change as a driver in degradation of freshwater ecosystems) (Sections 4.3.5, 4.5.5). Agriculture and irrigation account for the most significant proportion of consumptive water use and account for 60–70% of total water withdrawals (Hanasaki et al., 2018; Burke et al., 2020; Müller Schmied et al., 2021). Globally, 10% of the most water-stressed basins account for 35% of global irrigated calorie production (Qin et al., 2019), and food production is at risk in those basins and worldwide due to changes in hydrological components of climate change. Lack of access to clean water and sanitation has been one of the leading causes of water-borne diseases. In 2017, approximately 2.2 billion people lacked access to safe drinking water, and roughly 4.2 billion people could not access safe sanitation (WHO and UNICEF, 2019). Inequities in access to safe water are being amplified during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Box 4. 5 and Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7). The same 10% of most water-stressed basins also account for 19% of global thermal electricity generation (Qin et al., 2019), and globally, both production of hydropower and thermal power has been negatively affected by droughts and other extreme events. Globally, between 16% and 39% of cities experienced surface-water deficits between 1971 and 2000. If environmental flow requirements (EFRs) are accounted for, these numbers increase to 36% and 63%, respectively. Even under a scenario where urban water gets the highest priority, more than 440.5 million people in cities globally are projected to face a water deficit by 2050 (Flörke et al., 2018). The situation is particularly precarious in the Global South, where most of the population lacks access to piped water (WRI, 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Third, a large majority (~60%) of all adaptation responses documented since 2014 are about adapting to water-related hazards like droughts, floods and rainfall variability (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021b) (high confidence). Water-related adaptation action features prominently in NDC pledges by a large majority of countries in both Global North and Global South (GWP, 2018). These adaptation responses and their current benefits and effectiveness in reducing water-related risks in the future are systematically assessed in this chapter (Sections 4.6, 4.7.1, 4.7.2 and 4.7.3). These adaptation measures aim to reduce impacts of water-related hazards through responses such as irrigation, water and soil moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, changes in crops and cultivars, improved agronomic practices, among others (Sections 4.6.2; 4.7.1). Only ~20% of all documented case studies on observed water-related adaptations measure outcomes (positive or negative), but the link between positive outcomes and climate risk reduction is unclear and remains challenging to assess (Section 4.7.1) (medium confidence). On the other hand, most of the future projected water-related adaptations are more effective at lower GWLs (1.5°C) than at higher GWLs, showing the importance of mitigation for future adaptations to remain effective (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Finally, while limiting global warming to 1.5°C would minimise the increase in risks in the various water use sectors and keep adaptation effective, many mitigation measures can potentially impact future water security. For example, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation and reforestation can have a considerable water footprint if done at inappropriate locations (Section 4.7.6, see also Canadell et al., 2021). Therefore, minimising the risks to water security from climate change will require a full-systems view that considers the direct impacts of mitigation measures on water resources and their indirect effect via limiting climate change (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"This chapter draws on previous IPCC reports and new methodologies (Section 4.1.1 and SM4.1, SM4.2) and assesses the impacts of climate change on natural and human dimensions of the water cycle with a particular focus on water-related vulnerabilities and adaptation responses (Figure 4.1). Section 4.2 assesses observed changes in the hydrological cycle, and Section 4.3 focuses on their societal impacts and detects which parts of these changes are directly attributable to climate change. Section 4.4 assesses projected risks of changes in the hydrological cycle on various components of the hydrological cycle, and Section 4.5 assesses the same for sectoral risks. Projections and risks assessments for future impacts are framed in terms of GWLs and time horizons, as these are useful for informing mitigation policy under the Paris Agreement and informing adaptation planning. Sections 4.6 and 4.7 assesses current and future water-related adaptation responses in reducing climate and associated impacts and risks and looks at limits to adaptations, especially in a future warmer world. Finally, Section 4.8 outlines the enabling principles for meeting water security, SDGs and climate resilient development."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5, Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014) concluded that for each degree of global warming, approximately 7% of the global population, under a scenario of moderate population growth, was projected to be exposed to a decrease of renewable water resources of at least 20%. In addition, AR5 reported negative impacts on streamflow volumes, its seasonality (specifically in cryospheric zones), a decline in raw water quality (medium evidence, high agreement ) and projected reduction in renewable surface water and groundwater in most dry tropical regions. AR5 projected an increase in meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts in dry regions (medium confidence) (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) assessed that limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially reduce the probability of extreme droughts, precipitation deficits and risks associated with water availability in some regions (medium confidence). On the other hand, higher risks to natural and human systems in a 2.0°C world would mean increased vulnerability for the poor, showing that socioeconomic drivers are expected to have a more significant influence on water-related risks and vulnerabilities than changes in climate alone (medium confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) confirmed findings from AR5, with robust evidence of declines in snow cover and negative mass balance in most glaciers globally. Glacier melting seriously threatens water supply to mountain communities and millions living downstream through water shortages, jeopardising hydropower generation, irrigation and urban water uses (Hock et al., 2019b). Additionally, Arctic hydrology will be affected by permafrost changes, negatively impacting Arctic communities’ health and cultural identity (Meredith et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) stated that groundwater over-extraction for irrigation is causing depletion of groundwater storage (high confidence). The report also noted that precipitation changes, coupled with human drivers, will have a role in causing desertification, and water-driven soil erosion is projected to increase due to climate change (medium confidence). The population vulnerable to impacts related to water is projected to increase progressively at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming, with half of those impacted residing in South Asia, followed by Central Asia, West Africa and East Asia. SRCCL stated that improved irrigation techniques (e.g., drip irrigation) and moisture conservation (e.g., rainwater harvesting using indigenous and local practices) could increase farmers’ adaptive capacity (high confidence) (Mirzabaev et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group I (WGI) (Douville et al., 2021) concluded that anthropogenic climate change has increased atmospheric moisture and precipitation intensity (very likely  by 2–3% per 1°C) (high confidence), increased terrestrial ET (medium confidence) and contributed to drying in dry summer climates including in the Mediterranean, southwestern Australia, southwestern South America, South Africa and western North America (medium to high confidenc e), and has caused earlier onset of snowmelt and increased melting of glaciers (high confidence) since the mid-20th century. The report also stated with high confidence that the water cycle variability and extremes are projected to intensify, regardless of the mitigation policy. The share of the global population affected by water-related hazards and water availability issues is projected to increase with the intensification of water cycle variability and extremes. They concluded with high confidence that strong and rapid mitigation initiatives are needed to avert the manifestation of climate change in all components of the global water cycle."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Building on these previous reports, this chapter advances understanding climate change-induced hydrological changes and their societal impacts and risk in several key ways."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"First, since AR5, the methodology of climate change impact studies has advanced and these methodological advances are described in SM4.1. AR6 uses new projections (CMIP6) based on the SSPs and other scenarios, and we assess those results in this chapter alongside those using other projections and scenarios."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Second, this chapter follows the developments set in motion by SR1.5, SRCCL and SROCC to incorporate Indigenous knowledge (IK), traditional knowledge (TK) and local knowledge (LK). SR1.5 stated that disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, including Indigenous Peoples and certain local communities, are at disproportionately higher risk of suffering adverse consequences due to global warming of 1.5°C or more (Roy et al., 2018). SRCCL highlighted the enhanced efficacy of decision-making and governance with the involvement of local stakeholders, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change, such as Indigenous Peoples (Arneth et al., 2019). SROCC found adaptation efforts have benefited from the inclusion of IK and LK (IKLK) (Abram et al., 2019). In this chapter, we engage directly with Indigenous contributing authors and use multiple evidence-based approaches, as undertaken by the IPBES (Tengö et al., 2014; Tengö et al., 2017). This approach is guided by the understanding that the co-production of knowledge (between scholars and local communities) about water and climate change vulnerability, impacts and adaptation has the potential to lead to new water knowledge and context-specific governance strategies (Arsenault et al., 2019; Chakraborty and Sherpa, 2021). Additionally, shifting beyond the exclusive use of technical knowledge and Western viewpoints redresses the shortcomings of resource- and security-oriented understandings to water and acknowledges the more holistic and relational approaches common to IKLK (Section 4.8.4) (Stefanelli et al., 2017; Wilson, 2019; Chakraborty and Sherpa, 2021)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Finally, grounded in the AR6 goal to expand the solution space, this chapter advances the understanding of adaptation in the water sector since AR5 by deploying a meta-analysis of adaptation measures. The meta-analysis focuses on both current adaptation responses (Section 4.7.1) and future projected adaptation responses, which have been modelled (Section 4.7.2). The meta-review assesses the outcomes of current adaptation responses and effectiveness of future projected adaptations in reducing climate and associated risks. Studies derived from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) database (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021a) (see Chapter 16) were coded systematically following a meta-review protocol developed specifically for this assessment (Mukherji et al., 2021; SM4.2). A similar meta-review protocol was also developed to assess effectiveness of adaptations to reduce projected climate risks (Section 4.7.2; SM4.2)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Water scarcity and water insecurity are related concepts but not identical, and each has a range of interpretations leading to some overlap. Water scarcity can be broadly described as a mismatch between the demand for fresh water and its availability, quantified in physical terms. Water security/insecurity is a broader concept with definitions beyond physical water scarcity, encompassing access to water services, safety from poor water quality and flooding, and appropriate water governance that ensures access to safe water (Sadoff et al., 2020). Metrics of water security include both physical and socioeconomic components and are a tool for comparison between different locations and countries regarding relative levels of water security in the context of water-related risks. Some definitions of water scarcity also incorporate these broader issues. For example, ‘economic water scarcity’ has been defined as a situation where ‘human, institutional, and financial capital limit access to water, even though water in nature is available locally to meet human demands’ (Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, 2007). Economic water scarcity can also occur where infrastructure exists, but water distribution is inequitable (Jaeger et al., 2017). Much of the literature exploring the impacts of climate change on water security, however, focuses on quantifying physical water scarcity. Discussions in this box consider physical water scarcity as a quantifiable measure of water availability compared to its demand and consider the societal elements of economic water scarcity to be part of the more comprehensive concept of water insecurity."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,Physical water scarcity
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Definitions of water scarcity have evolved to take account of a broader set of factors. For example, physical water scarcity indicates that an insufficient quantity of water is available to meet requirements. A commonly used measure of physical water scarcity is the Falkenmark index which measures the amount of renewable freshwater available per capita (Falkenmark et al., 1989; White et al., 2014). However, the Falkenmark index is now regarded as an incomplete measure, as it does not account for water needed for non-human needs (as quantified with EFRs). Therefore, EFRs have begun to be incorporated in recent water scarcity assessments (Liu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017b). Quality-induced water scarcity is an additional factor beginning to be considered (Liu and Zhao, 2020) ."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Using a Water Scarcity Index (WSI) defined as the ratio of demand and availability, accounting for EFRs, it is estimated that 4 billion people live under conditions of severe water scarcity for at least one month per year (Figure Box 4.1.1a; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016). Nearly half of these people live in India and China. Although regions with high water scarcity are already naturally dry (virtually certain2), 1 human influence on climate is leading to reduced water availability in many regions. It is very likely  that global patterns of soil moisture change are being driven by human influence on climate, and an overall global decline in soil moisture is attributable to greenhouse forcing [4.2.1.3]. Climate change patterns of streamflow change include declines in western North America, northeast South America, the Mediterranean and South Asia (medium confidence) [4.2.3]. However, quantification of the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to current levels of water scarcity is not yet available."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Water demand is projected to change as a direct result of socioeconomic changes. For example, the global water demand for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses, at present about 4600 km³ yr –1, is projected to increase by 20–30% by 2050 (Greve et al., 2018), depending on the socioeconomic scenario. Changes in water availability and demand have been projected in several studies using climate models and socioeconomic scenarios (e.g., Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; Greve et al., 2018; Koutroulis et al., 2019). In such studies, the projected changes in water availability arise from differences in precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET). However, both precipitation and evapotranspiration are also subject to very high uncertainty in key processes such as regional climate change patterns (Uhe et al., 2021) and the influence of vegetation responses to elevated CO2 on transpiration (Betts et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Human factors are projected to be the dominant driver of future water scarcity on a global scale (Graham et al., 2020a). However, at regional scales, high uncertainty in climate changes means that reduced water availability is more likely than not  in many major river basins and remains a risk in most basins even where the central estimate is for increased water availability due to climate change (Figure 4.16). Such substantial uncertainties in projected water scarcity are crucial factors causing water management policies and planning challenges in the future. Therefore, locations projected to see significant increases in water scarcity with large uncertainty can be considered to be subject to the highest challenges for water management policy (Figure Box 4.1.1b; Greve et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p8,NO_TITLE,Water security and insecurity
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Unlike physical water scarcity, water security or insecurity cannot be quantified in absolute terms. However, relative levels of water security in different places can be compared using metrics representing critical aspects of security (Gain et al., 2016; Young et al., 2019), ideally with thresholds for secure/insecure compared with local experience to assess validity (Young et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Gain et al. (2016) define a Global Water Security Index (GWSI) metric on a scale of 0 to 1 combining indicators of relative levels of availability of freshwater, accessibility to water services, water management and water quality and safety (including flood risk, which can affect water quality as well as being a direct physical hazard). Global application of this index indicates large worldwide differences in water security arising from different combinations of reasons (Figure Box 4.1.2a). In North Africa, the Middle East, large parts of the Indian sub-continent and north China, low water security arises predominantly from low water availability. However, many areas with relatively high water availability have relatively low levels of water security due to other factors. In 2015, 29% of the world’s population did not have access to safe drinking water (Ritchie and Roser, 2019). In large parts of South and Southeast Asia, significant contributions to water insecurity came from increased flood risk and deteriorated water quality (Burgess et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2017; Farinosi et al., 2018). Water availability is relatively high across most of Africa, but water security is relatively low due to low accessibility, management and safety/quality standards. Most people in Africa do not have access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation (Marson and Savin, 2015; Naik, 2017; Armah et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p11,NO_TITLE,"In contrast, some areas with high physical water scarcity, such as some parts of the USA, Australia and southern Europe, show relatively high water security levels due to good governance, safety/quality and accessibility. Nevertheless, marginalised groups such as Indigenous Peoples experience reduced access to water even within regions in the Global North. For example, in both Canada and the USA, many Indigenous Peoples living on reserves lack access to piped water (Collins et al., 2017; Hanrahan, 2017; Marshall et al., 2018) and (or) are on boil water advisories (Patrick et al., 2019). In Australia, 25–40% of Aboriginal people live in remote rural areas with poor access to clean water (Bowles, 2015; NCCARF, 2018)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p13,NO_TITLE,"The discrepancy between physical water scarcity and overall water insecurity is a function of socioeconomic vulnerabilities and governance gaps. Therefore, improving societal aspects of water management will be key in adapting to climate change-driven increases in water scarcity in the future (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p14,NO_TITLE,"Future water security will depend on the magnitude, rate and regional details of future climate change and non-climatic factors, including agricultural practices, water demand and governance. In many cases, climate change may not be the dominant factor affecting water security. Nevertheless, climate change poses clear risks to water security in many regions through potential impacts on water availability, quality and flooding. The range of possible outcomes is extremely large, and assessing the likelihood of particular outcomes depends on consideration of uncertain regional climate changes and uncertain socioeconomic futures. Uncertainty in future water scarcity projections makes climate change risks to water security and planning for adaptation challenging. Limiting climate change to lower levels of global warming would reduce the risks to water security arising from climate change, partly because uncertainties in regional climate change are smaller at lower levels of warming."
wg2_ch04_box-4.1_p15,NO_TITLE,"In summary, roughly half of the world’s population are assessed as currently subject to severe water scarcity for at least some part of the year due to climatic and non-climatic factors, and this is projected to be exacerbated at higher levels of warming (medium confidence). General water insecurity issues are seen worldwide, particularly in South Asia, North China, Africa and the Middle East, due to high population densities often coupled with low water availability, accessibility, quality and governance (high confidence). Areas with high water availability can also be water-insecure due to increased flood risk, deteriorated water quality, and poor governance (high confidence). Future water security will depend on the evolution of all these socioeconomic and governance factors and future regional climate change (high confidence). The main climate change contribution to water insecurity is the potential for reduced water availability, with a secondary contribution from increased flooding risk (medium confidence). Future socioeconomic conditions are a crucial driver of water insecurity, implying the need for further adaptation to some level of future climate change (medium confidence). However, policy challenges are high in many regions, with uncertainty in the regional climate outcomes being a key factor (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The water cycle is affected by both climatic and non-climatic factors (Douville et al., 2021). Radiative forcing by changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, aerosols and surface albedo drives global and regional changes in evaporation and precipitation (Douville et al., 2021). A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing global and regional mean precipitation, and more extreme precipitation (Allan et al., 2014; Giorgi et al., 2019; Allan et al., 2020). Regional precipitation responses vary according to changes in atmospheric circulation. Geographical variation in aerosols drives changes in atmospheric circulation, affecting precipitation patterns such as the Asian monsoon (Ganguly et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2019). (Section 4.2.1)"
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Warming increases glacier melt and is expected to decrease snowfall globally and lead to shorter snow seasons with earlier but less rapid snowmelt. It can also lead to local increases in snowfall intensity (Allan et al., 2020). These changes affect the seasonality of river flows in glacier-fed or snow-dominated basins. (Section 4.2.2)"
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Rising atmospheric CO2 generally decreases plant transpiration, affecting soil moisture, runoff, stream flows, the return of moisture to the atmosphere and surface temperature (Skinner et al., 2017). However, in some regions, these can be offset by increased leaf area (‘global greening’) driven by elevated CO2, land use change, nitrogen deposition and effects of climate change itself (Zhu Z. et al., 2016; Zeng Z. et al., 2018). Increased ozone can impact plant functioning, reducing transpiration (Arnold et al., 2018). (Section 4.2.1)"
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Direct human interventions include abstraction of surface water and groundwater for drinking, irrigation and other freshwater uses, as well as streamflow impoundment behind dams and large-scale inter-basin transfers (Zhao et al., 2015; Donchyts et al., 2016; McMillan et al., 2016; Shumilova et al., 2018). The consequences of these interventions are substantial and are discussed below briefly. In addition, these direct human interventions can change due to various societal and economic factors, including changes in land use and urbanisation (Sections 4.3 and 4.5)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Irrigation can reduce river flows and groundwater levels via abstraction and increase local precipitation (Alter et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015), alter precipitation remotely through moisture advection (de Vrese et al., 2016) and change the timing of monsoons through land–sea temperature contrasts (Guimberteau et al., 2012) (Box 4.3). Land cover change affects ET and precipitation (Li et al., 2015; Douville et al., 2021), interception of precipitation by vegetation canopies (de Jong and Jetten, 2007), infiltration (Sun et al., 2018a) and runoff (Bosmans et al., 2017). Land cover impacts on the hydrological cycle are of similar magnitude as human water use (Bosmans et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Urbanisation decreases land surface permeability (Choi et al., 2016), which can increase fast runoff and flooding risks and reduce local rainfall by decreasing moisture return to the atmosphere (Wang et al., 2018). But urbanisation can also increase the sensible heat flux driving greater or more extreme precipitation (Kusaka et al., 2014; Niyogi et al., 2017). (Section 4.3.4)"
wg2_ch04_4.1.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In summary, radiative forcing by GHG and aerosols drives changes in ET and precipitation at global and regional scales, and the associated warming shifts the balance between frozen and liquid water (high confidence). Rising CO2 concentrations also affect the water cycle via plant physiological responses affecting transpiration, including via reduced stomatal opening and increased leaf area (high confidence regarding the individual processes; medium confidence regarding their net impact). Land cover changes and urbanisation affect both the climate and land hydrology by altering the exchanges of energy and moisture between the atmosphere and surface (high confidence) and changing the permeability of the land surface. Direct human interventions in river systems and groundwater systems are non-climatic drivers with substantial impacts on the water cycle (high confidence) and have the potential to change as part of societal responses to climate change (Figure 4.2)."
wg2_ch04_4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"All components of the global water cycle have been modified due to climate change in recent decades (high confidence) (Douville et al., 2021), with hundreds of millions of people now regularly experiencing hydrological conditions that were previously unfamiliar (Sections 4.2.1.1, 4.2.4, 4.2.5). Extensive records from weather stations, satellites and radar clearly show that precipitation patterns have shifted worldwide. Three major shifts documented are (a) some regions receiving more annual or seasonal precipitation and others less, (b) many regions have seen increased heavy precipitation, and many have seen either increases or decreases in dry spells and (c) some regions have seen shifts towards heavier precipitation events separated by more prolonged dry spells (Section 4.2.1.1). Observationally based calculations suggest that ET has changed in response to changes in precipitation and increasing temperatures, resulting in changing patterns of soil moisture worldwide which are now detectable by satellite remote sensing (Sections 4.2.1.2, 4.2.1.3). Rising temperatures have caused profound and extensive changes in the global cryosphere, with mountain glaciers, land ice and snow cover shrinking, causing substantial, permanent impacts on the ways of life of people in these regions, particularly Indigenous Peoples with strong cultural links to long-term or seasonally frozen environments (Sections 4.2.2, 4.3.8). Groundwater recharge in spring may have been reduced due to shorter snowmelt seasons, although the dominant impact on groundwater has been non-climatic and through intensification of irrigation (Section 4.2.6). The global-scale pattern of streamflow changes is now attributable to observed historical climate change, with human land and water use insufficient by themselves to explain the observed streamflow changes at global scales (Section 4.2.3). Numerous examples of extreme hydrometeorological events, including heavy precipitation, flooding, drought and wildfire events causing deaths, high levels of economic damage and extensive ecological impacts, have been shown to have been made more likely  by human influence on climate through increased GHG concentrations in the atmosphere (Sections 4.2.1.1, 4.2.4, 4.2.5).

In 2020, approximately 498 million people lived in unfamiliarly wet areas, where the long-term average precipitation is as high as previously seen in only about one in 6 years (medium confidence) (Figure 4.3c). These areas are primarily in mid and high latitudes (Hawkins et al., 2020). On the other hand, approximately 163 million people lived in unfamiliarly dry areas, mostly in low latitudes (medium confidence).

Precipitation extremes have changed in some places where annual precipitation shows no trend. Some regions such as southern Africa and parts of southern South America are seeing increased heavy precipitation and longer dry spells. Many regions with changing extremes are highly populated, such as the Indian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, Europe and parts of North America, South America and southern Africa (Figure 4.3h,i).

Since transpiration accounts for much of the land-atmosphere water flux (Good et al., 2015), vegetation changes also play a significant role in overall changes in ET."

Higher photosynthesis increases leaf area index (LAI) (‘structural effect’) and therefore transpiration; 55 ± 25% of observed increases in ET (1980–2011) have been attributed to LAI change (Zeng Z. et al., 2018). Increases in ET driven by increased LAI (from satellite observations 1982–2012) are estimated at 0.32 ± 0.07 mm month –1 per decade, generating a climate forcing of −0.31 Wm–2 per decade (Zeng et al., 2017)."

In dry regions, ET may increase due to increasing LAI (Huang M et al., 2015), but in some densely vegetated regions, the stomatal effect dominates (Mao et al., 2015). Reductions in transpiration due to rising CO2 concentrations may also be offset by a longer growing season (Frank et al., 2015; Mankin et al., 2019). Other factors modulate the transpiration effect both temporally and spatially, for example, additional vegetation structural changes (Kim et al., 2015; Domec et al., 2017), vegetation disturbance and age (Donohue et al., 2017) and species (Bernacchi and VanLoocke, 2015)."

Larger increases in ET are also observed in several regions, including northeast Brazil, western central Africa, southern Africa, southern India, southern China, and northern Australia. Decreases of around 10 mm yr -2 are reported for western Amazonia and central Africa (Miralles et al., 2014), although not across all data sets (Zeng et al., 2018). In estimates of past changes in long-term drying or wetting of the land surface driven by climate, uncertainties in ET observations or reconstructions make a more substantial contribution to the overall uncertainty than observed changes in precipitation (Greve et al., 2014).

From 1922 to 2018, snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere peaked in the 1950s to 1970s (Mudryk et al., 2020) and has consistently reduced since the end of the 20th century (Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015; Thackeray et al., 2016; Mudryk et al., 2017; Beniston et al., 2018; Hammond et al., 2018; Thackeray et al., 2019; Mudryk et al., 2020).

Negative trends in snow-dominated period duration of 2.0–6.5 weeks per decade was detected from surface and satellite observations during 1971–2014 (Allchin and Déry, 2017), mainly owing to earlier seasonal snowmelt (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).

In these regions, snowmelt runoff accounts for more than 30% of irrigated water supplies (Qin et al., 2020).

Precipitation explains over 80% of the changes in discharge of large rivers from 1950 to 2010 in northern Asia and northern Europe, where the impact of human activities is relatively limited (Li et al., 2020b). In northwest Europe, precipitation and evaporation changes explain many observed trends in streamflow (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2019). In several polar areas in northern Europe (e.g., Finland), North America (e.g., British Columbia in Canada) and Siberia, many studies reported increased winter streamflow primarily due to climate warming, for instance, more rainfall instead of snowfall and more glacier runoff in the winter period (e.g., Bonsal et al., 2020) (Section 4.2.2). A similar phenomenon of the earlier snowmelt runoff is also found in North America during 1960–2014 (Dudley et al., 2017). Thus, climate drivers largely explain changes in the average and maximum runoff of predominantly snow-fed rivers (Yang et al., 2015 a; Bring et al., 2016; Tananaev et al., 2016; Frolova et al., 2017b; Ficklin et al., 2018; Magritsky et al., 2018; Rets et al., 2018)."

In some regions, the impact of human activities on runoff and streamflow outplays the climate factors, for example, in some typical catchments with area near to or less than 15000 km 2 in China (Zhai and Tao, 2017)."

However, this does not consider attribution of the climate drivers to anthropogenic forcing. Using time series of low, mean and high river flows from 7250 observatories around the world (1971–2010) and global hydrological models (GHMs) driven by Earth System Model (ESM) simulations with and without anthropogenic forcing of climate change, Gudmundsson et al. (2021) also found direct human influence to have a relatively small impact on global patterns of streamflow trends. Gudmundsson et al. (2021) further identified anthropogenic climate change as a causal driver of the global pattern of recent trends in mean and extreme river flow (Figure 4.7). Overall, the sign of observed trends and simulations accounting for human influence on the climate system was found to be consistent for decreased mean flows in western and eastern North America, southern Europe, northeast South America and the Indian sub-continent, and increased flows in northern Europe. Similar conclusions were drawn for low and high flows, except for the Indian sub-continent.

However, simulations of streamflow can differ between models depending on their structures and parametrisations, contributing to uncertainties for trend detection, especially when considering human intervention (e.g., Caillouet et al., 2017; Hattermann et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2019b; Telteu et al., 2021)."

Estimates of flood exposure using satellite-derived inundation area and high-resolution population data showed a 20–24% increase during 2000–2018 (Tellman et al., 2021). Analyses of in situ streamflow measurement showed both increases and decreases in the frequency of river floods for 1960–2010 in Europe (Berghuijs et al., 2017a; Blöschl et al., 2019a) and the USA (Berghuijs et al., 2017a), an overall increase in China, Brazil and Australia (Berghuijs et al., 2017a) but decrease in some areas in the Mediterranean (Tramblay et al., 2019) and southern Australia (Ishak et al., 2013; Do et al., 2017).

Observed flood risks changes in recent decades are often caused by human factors such as increased urbanisation and population growth rather than climate change alone (Tramblay et al., 2019). There is medium confidence that flood vulnerability varies among various regions and countries (Jongman et al., 2012; Scussolini et al., 2016; Tanoue et al., 2016) (Figure 4.8), reflecting differences in GDP, severity and characteristics of hazard and political and social conditions (Rufat et al., 2015). Flood vulnerability has decreased with economic development in many regions, while increased exposure has elevated risk in some places (Mechler, 2016; Tanoue et al., 2016). Global annual mean expected damage considering the current flood protection standard is estimated to be USD 54 million under the climate of 1976–2005 and unevenly distributed (Alfieri et al., 2017). Similar estimation using different models shows an increase of flood exposure in the past (USD 31 million for 1971–1990 and USD 45 million for 1991–2010 without population change as fixed in 2010) (Tanoue et al., 2016) (Section 4.7.5)."

While observed increases in extreme precipitation have increased the frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods and river floods in some regions, floods could decrease in some regions due to other factors. These factors could include soil wetness condition, cryospheric change, land cover change and river system management, adaptation measures or water usage within the river basin (WGI FAQ8.2). For example, in the USA and Europe, a study indicated that major (e.g., 25–100-year return period) floods did not show significant long-term trends (Hodgkins et al., 2019). Nevertheless, anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of a number of major heavy precipitation events and floods that resulted in disastrous impacts in southern and eastern Asia, Europe, North America and South America (Table 4.3) (high confidence). Davenport et al. (2021) demonstrated that anthropogenic changes in precipitation extremes had contributed one third of the cost of flood damages (from 1988 to 2017) in the USA. Anthropogenic climate change has altered 64% (eight out of 22 events increased, eight decreased) of floods events with significant losses and damages during 2010–2013 (Hirabayashi et al., 2021a). Gudmundsson et al. (2021) attributed observed change in extreme river flow trends to anthropogenic climate change (Section 4.2.3).

The variability in groundwater storage is a function of human abstraction and natural recharge, which is in turn controlled by local geology (Green, 2016). In humid regions, precipitation influences recharge, and linear associations between precipitation and recharge are often observed (Kotchoni et al., 2019); for example, over humid locations in sub-Saharan Africa (Cuthbert et al., 2019b)."

Global hydrological models (Herbert and Döll, 2019) show that human-induced groundwater depletion at rates exceeding 20 mm yr –1 (2001–2010) is occurring in the major aquifers systems such as the High Plains and California Central Valley aquifers (USA), Arabian aquifer (Middle East), North-Western Sahara Aquifer System (North Africa), Indo-Gangetic Basin (India) and North China Plain (China) (high confidence). Groundwater depletion at lower rates (<10 mm yr –1) is taking place in the Amazon Basin (Brazil) and Mekong River Basin (South East Asia), primarily due to climate variability and change (high confidence). A global-scale analysis (Shamsudduha and Taylor, 2020) of GRACE satellite measurements (2002–2016) for the 37 world’s large aquifer systems reveals that trends in groundwater storage are mostly nonlinear and declines are not secular (high confidence). There are strong statistical associations between changes in groundwater storage and extreme annual precipitation from 1901 to 2016 in the Great Artesian Basin (Australia) and the California Central Valley aquifer (USA). Groundwater recharge of high magnitudes can be generated from intensive precipitation events. On the other hand, recharge can become more episodic, mostly in arid to semiarid locations (robust evidence, medium agreement ). For example, in central Tanzania, seven rainfall events between 1955 and 2010 generated 60% of total recharge (Taylor et al., 2013b). Similarly, in southern India (Asoka et al., 2018) and the southwestern USA (Thomas et al., 2016), focused recharge via losses from ephemeral river channels, overland flows, and floodwaters is documented (Cuthbert et al., 2019b)."

Globally, 10–23% of the watersheds have reached the environmental flow limits due to groundwater pumping (de Graaf et al., 2019). A recent study of 4.2 million wells across the USA shows that induced groundwater recharge in nearly two thirds of these wells could reduce stream discharges, thereby threatening GDEs (Jasechko et al., 2021). Work (2020) found reduced spring flow due to increased groundwater abstraction in 26 out of 56 springs studied in Florida (USA). GDEs in semiarid and arid regions tend to have much longer groundwater response times and may be more resilient to climate change than those in humid areas where groundwater occurrence is mostly at shallow levels (Cuthbert et al., 2019a; Opie et al., 2020).

River length affected by natural acid drainage increased from 5 km in 1945 to 35 km in 2018 (Zarroca et al., 2021). Threefold increases in contaminants and fivefold increases in nutrients have been observed in water sources after wildfires (Khan et al., 2015).

In 1986–2015, the sedimentation rate in dry valley bottoms of the Southern Russian Plain was two-2–5 times lower than in 1963–1986 due to the warming-induced surface runoff reduction during spring snowmelt (Golosov et al., 2018). Declining erosion trends are primarily associated with soil conservation management in northern Germany (Steinhoff-Knopp and Burkhard, 2018) and reforestation in southwestern China (Zhou et al., 2020)."

Still, such correlation is yet to be found for the other European rivers (Vanmaercke et al., 2015). Increased sediment and particulate organic carbon fluxes in the Arctic regions are caused by permafrost warming (Schiefer et al., 2018; Lafrenière and Lamoureux, 2019; Ward Jones et al., 2019). Potemkina and Potemkin (2015) demonstrate that regional warming and permafrost degradation have contributed to an increased forested area over the last 40–70 years, reducing soil erosion in eastern Siberia. The sediment dynamics of small rivers in the eastern Italian Alps, depending on extreme floods, is sensitive to climate change (Rainato et al., 2017). In the northeastern Italian Alps, precipitation change during 1986–2010 affected soil wetness conditions, influencing sediment load (Diodato et al., 2018).

In this section, we assess burgeoning evidence since AR5 which shows that environmental quality, economic development and social well-being have been affected by climate-induced hydrological changes since many aspects of the economy, environment and society are dependent upon water resources. We advance previous IPCC reports by assessing evidence on the impacts of climate change-induced water insecurity for energy production (Section 4.3.2), urbanisation (Section 4.3.4), conflicts (Section 4.3.6), human mobility (Section 4.3.7) and cultural usage of water (Section 4.3.8)."

Of these lands, 68% experience blue water scarcity at the least one month yr –1 and 37% up to five months yr –1. Such agricultural water scarcity is experienced in mostly drought-prone areas in low-income countries (Rosa et al., 2020a). Approximately three quarters of the global harvested areas (~454 million hectares) experienced drought-induced yield losses between 1983 and 2009, and the cumulative production losses corresponded to USD 166 billion (Kim et al., 2019). Globally, droughts affected both harvested areas and yields, with a reported cereal production loss of 9–10% due to weather extremes between 1964 and 2007. Yield losses were greater by about 7% during recent droughts (1985–2007) due to greater damage—reducing harvested area—compared to losses from earlier droughts (1964–1984), with 8–11% greater losses in high-income countries than in low-income ones (Lesk et al., 2016). Globally, between 1961 and 2006, it has been estimated that 25% yield loss occurred, with yield loss probability increasing by 22% for maize, 9% for rice and 22% for soybean under drought conditions (Leng and Hall, 2019). Mean climate and climate extremes are responsible for 20–49% of yield anomalies variance, with 18–45% of this variance attributable to droughts and heatwaves (Vogel et al., 2019). Drought has been singled out as a major driver of yield reductions globally (high confidence) (Lesk et al., 2016; Meng et al., 2016; Zipper et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019; Leng and Hall, 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Yields of major crops in semiarid regions, including the Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Australia, are negatively affected by precipitation declines in the absence of irrigation (Iizumi et al., 2018; Ray et al., 2019), but this trend is less evident in wetter regions (Iizumi et al., 2018). Precipitation and temperature changes reduced global mean yields of maize, wheat and soybeans by 4.1, 1.8 and 4.5%, respectively (Iizumi et al., 2018). Of the global rice yield variability of ~32%, precipitation variability accounted for a larger share in drier South Asia than in wetter East and Southeast Asia (Ray et al., 2015). Between 1910 and 2014 agro-climatic conditions became more conducive to maize and soybean yield growth in the American Midwest due to increases in summer precipitation and cooling due to irrigation (Iizumi and Ramankutty, 2016; Mueller et al., 2016) (Box 4.3). In Australia, between 1990 and 2015, the negative effects of reduced precipitation and rising temperature led to yield losses, but yield losses were partly avoided because of elevated CO2 atmospheric concentration and technological advancements (Hochman et al., 2017a). Overall, temperature-only effects are stronger in wetter regions like Europe and East and Southeast Asia, and precipitation-only effects are stronger in drier regions (Iizumi et al., 2018; Ray et al., 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement ). In Asia, the gap between rain-fed and irrigated maize yield widened from 5% in the 1980s to 10% in the 2000s (Meng et al., 2016). In North America, yields of maize and soybeans have increased (1958–2007), yet meteorological drought has been associated with 13% of overall yield variability. However, yield variability was not a concern where irrigation is prevalent (Zipper et al., 2016). However, when water scarcity has reduced irrigation, yields have been negatively impacted (Elias et al., 2016). In Europe, yields have been affected negatively by droughts (Beillouin et al., 2020), with losses tripling between 1964 and 2015 (Brás et al., 2021). In West Africa, between 2000 and 2009, drought, among other altered climate conditions, led to millet and sorghum yield reductions between 10 and 20% and 5 and 15%, respectively (Sultan et al., 2019). Between 2006 and 2016, droughts contributed to food insecurity and malnutrition in northern, eastern and southern Africa, Asia and the Pacific. In 36% of these nations—mainly in Africa—where severe droughts occurred, undernourishment increased (Phalkey et al., 2015; Cooper et al., 2019). An attribution study showed that anthropogenic emissions increased the chances of October–December droughts over the region by 1.4–4.3 times and resulted in below-average harvests in Zambia and South Africa (Nangombe et al., 2020). Root crops, a staple in many tropics and subtropical countries, and vegetables are particularly prone to drought, leading to smaller fruits or crop failure (Daryanto et al., 2017; Bisbis et al., 2018). Livestock production has also been affected by changing seasonality, increasing frequency of drought, rising temperatures and vector-borne diseases and parasites through changes in the overall availability, as well as reduced nutritional value, of forage and feed crops (Varadan and Kumar, 2014; Naqvi et al., 2015; Zougmoré et al., 2016; Henry et al., 2018; Godde et al., 2019) (medium confidence)."

Changes in groundwater storage and availability, which are affected by the intensity of irrigated agriculture, also negatively impacted crop yields and cropping patterns (Section 4.2.6, Box 4.3, 4.7.2). Moreover, extreme precipitation can lead to increased surface flooding, waterlogging, soil erosion and susceptibility to salinisation (high confidence). For example, in Bangladesh, in March and April 2017, floods affected 220,000 ha of a nearly harvest-ready summer paddy crop and resulted in almost a 30% year-on-year increase in paddy prices. An attribution study of those pre-monsoon extreme rainfall events in Bangladesh concluded that anthropogenic climate change doubled the likelihood of the extreme rainfall event (Rimi et al., 2019). Moreover, floods, extreme weather events and cyclones have led to animal escapes and infrastructure damage in aquaculture (Beveridge et al., 2018; Islam and Hoq, 2018; Naskar et al., 2018; Lebel et al., 2020) (see Section 5.9.1)."

Historically, they have been the most vulnerable to observed climate-induced hydrological changes (Savo et al., 2016). Indigenous and local communities, often heavily reliant on agriculture, have a wealth of knowledge about observed changes. These are important because they shape farmers’ perceptions, which in turn shape the adaptation measures farmers will undertake (Caretta and Börjeson, 2015; Savo et al., 2016; Sujakhu et al., 2016; Su et al., 2017) (Section 4.8.4) (high confidence)."

In the USA, hydropower generation dropped by nearly 27% for every standard deviation increase in water scarcity. Equivalent social costs of loss in hydropower generation between 2001 and 2012 were approximately USD 330,000 (at 2015 value) per month for every power plant that experienced water scarcity (Eyer and Wichman, 2018). Globally, for the period 1981–2010, the utilisation rate of hydropower was reduced by 5.2% during drought years compared to long-term average values (van Vliet et al., 2016a).

A global systematic review of studies since 2005 shows that climate change is a critical direct driver of freshwater ecosystems impacts through increasing temperatures or declining rainfall, for example, by causing physiological stress or death (thermal stress, dehydration or desiccation), limiting food supplies, or resulting in migration of animals to other feeding or breeding areas, and possibly increased competition with animals already present in those migrating locations {Diaz et al. 2019; Dziba et al. 2018}. Other drivers include land use changes, water pollution, extraction of water, drainage and conversion, and invasive species, which to varying extents interact synergistically with climate change or are exacerbated due to climate change (Finlayson et al., 2017; Ramsar Convention, 2018)."
wg2_ch04_4.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"The Global Wetland Outlook (Ramsar Convention, 2018) reported that between 1970 and 2015, the area of freshwater wetlands declined by approximately 35% (Davidson and Finlayson, 2018), with high levels of the overall percentage of threatened species recorded in Madagascar and Indian Ocean islands (43%); in Europe (36%); in the tropical Andes (35%); and New Zealand (41%) (Ramsar Convention, 2018). Where long-term data are available, only 13% of the wetlands recorded in and around the year 1700 remained by 2000. However, these data may overestimate the rate of loss (Davidson, 2014) (limited evidence, medium agreement ). Many wetland-dependent species have seen a long-term decline, with the Living Planet Index showing that 81% of populations of freshwater species are in decline and others being threatened by extinction (Davidson and Finlayson, 2018; Darrah et al., 2019; Diaz et al., 2019) (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.3.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Temperature changes lead to changes in the distribution patterns of freshwater species. Poleward and up-elevation range shifts due to warming temperatures tend to ultimately lead to reduced range sizes. Freshwater species in the tropics are particularly vulnerable (Jezkova and Wiens, 2016; Sheldon, 2019). Systematic shifts towards higher elevation and upstream were found for 32 stream fish species in France (Comte and Grenouillet, 2013). In North America, for the bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) a reduction in the number of occupied sites was documented in a watershed in Montana (Eby et al., 2014). Other impacts include disruption of seasonal movements of migratory waterbirds that regularly visit freshwater ecosystems, with adverse impacts on their feeding and breeding (Finlayson et al., 2006; Bussière et al., 2015). Keystone species, such as the beaver (Caster Canadensis) in North America, have been moving into new areas as the vegetation structure has changed in response to higher temperatures enabling shrubs to establish in the Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems (Jung et al., 2016). Increased occurrence and intensity of algal blooms have occurred due to the interactive effects of thermal extremes and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in water (Griffith and Gobler, 2020) (Section 4.2.7). A global review found that almost 90% of all studies reviewed documented a decline in salmonid populations in North America and Europe, and identified knowledge gaps elsewhere (Myers et al., 2017). Another review (Pecl et al., 2017) found declines in Atlantic salmon in Finland and poleward shift in coastal fish species, while another review (Scheffers et al., 2016) noted hybridisation between freshwater species like invasive rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and native cutthroat trout (O. clarkia)."

However, responses of individual lakes to warming were very dependent on local characteristics (O’Reilly et al., 2015), with warming enhancing the impacts of eutrophication in some instances (Sepulveda-Jauregui et al., 2018). For example, temperature increases led to lower oxygen concentrations in eutrophic coastal wetlands due to phytoplankton and microbial respiration (Jenny et al., 2016) and stimulated algal blooms (Michalak, 2016) and affected the community structure of fish and other biotas (Mantyka-Pringle et al., 2014; Poesch et al., 2016)."

Thawing of the permafrost leads to increased erosion and runoff and changes in the geomorphology and vegetation of arctic peatlands (Nilsson et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2018b). Permafrost thawing has led to the expansion of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (Li et al., 2014). As northern high-latitude peatlands store a large amount of carbon, permafrost thawing can increase methane and carbon dioxide emissions (Schuur et al., 2015; Moomaw et al., 2018). This represents a major gap in our understanding of the rates of change and their consequences for freshwater ecosystems."

Freshwater ecosystems are also under extreme pressure from changes in land use and water pollution, with climate change exacerbating these, such as the further decline of snow cover (DeBeer et al., 2016) and increased consumptive use of fresh water, and leading to the decline, and possibly extinction, of many freshwater-dependent populations (high confidence). Thus, differentiating between the impacts of multiple drivers is needed, especially given the synergistic and cumulative nature of such impacts, which remains a knowledge gap."

Some studies associate conflicts with local abundance of water (Salehyan and Hendrix, 2014; Selby and Hoffmann, 2014; de Juan, 2015), mainly because of political mobilisation around abundant waters and the need for developing new rules of allocation among competing users. Others provide evidence that the increase in water availability in some areas compared with a decrease in other surrounding areas can affect the risk of a conflict in a region (de Juan, 2015) (low to medium confidence). However, the large majority acknowledges reduction of water availability due to climate change as having the potential to exacerbate tensions (de Stefano et al., 2017; Waha et al., 2017), especially in regions and within groups dependent on agriculture for food production (von Uexkull et al., 2016; Koubi, 2019) (high confidence). Particularly representative is the case of Syria, where drought aggravated existing water and agricultural insecurity (Kelley et al., 2015). However, whether drought caused civil unrest in Syria remains highly debated (Gleick, 2014; Kelley et al., 2017; Selby et al., 2017; Ash and Obradovich, 2019). Additionally, there is no consensus on the causal association between observed climate changes and conflict (Hsiang Solomon et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2015; Selby, 2019). However, evidence suggests that changes in rainfall patterns amplify existing tensions (Abel et al., 2019); examples include Syria, Iraq (Abbas et al., 2016; von Lossow, 2016) and Yemen (Mohamed et al., 2017) (medium confidence). There is also medium evidence that in some regions of Africa (e.g., Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo), there are links between observed water stress and individual attitude for participating in violence, particularly for the least resilient individuals (von Uexkull et al., 2020) (medium confidence). A reverse association from conflict to climate impacts has also been observed (Buhaug, 2016).

Climate change concerns also play a role in stimulating cooperative efforts, as in the case of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basin (Mirumachi, 2015; Link et al., 2016) (medium confidence). More generally, there is some evidence that when hydrological conditions change in transboundary river basins, formal agreements (e.g., water treaties or river basin organisations) can enhance cooperation (de Stefano et al., 2017; Dinar et al., 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement ). Still, more cooperation does not necessarily reduce the risk of conflict, especially when water variability increases beyond a certain threshold (low evidence, medium agreement ) (Dinar et al., 2015; Dinar et al., 2019)."

Likewise, ice loss in the Cordillera Blanca in the Peruvian Andes has challenged traditional approaches of interacting with the glaciers (Motschmann et al., 2020) (Section 4.2.2). There is high confidence that cryospheric changes in high-mountain areas also impact traditional pastoral practices by altering seasonal conditions, pasture quality and water availability. For example, pasture quality in India (Ingty, 2017); Tibet Autonomous Region, People’s Republic of China (Nyima and Hopping, 2019); and Bolivia (Yager et al., 2019) has been negatively impacted by climate-related hydrological changes, leading some Indigenous herders to diversify livestock, while herders in Nepal (Popular and Rik, 2016) and Peru (Postigo, 2020) have altered their routes in response to local water scarcity. Local communities in high-mountain areas understand these hydrological changes through cultural and spiritual frameworks (medium evidence, high agreement ).

Water cycle variability and extremes are projected to increase faster than average changes in most regions of the world and under all emission scenarios (high confidence). The concept of ‘wetter regions get wetter, drier regions get drier’ from AR5 (Collins et al., 2013) is assessed by AR6 WGI (Douville et al., 2021) as too simplistic.

The multi-model median change is close to zero. Most other regions show a smaller range of changes (except for very dry regions where a small absolute change in precipitation appears as a larger percentage change). Nevertheless, across most global land regions, both increases and decreases in precipitation are projected across the ensemble. At 1.5°C global warming, a complete consensus on increased precipitation is seen only in the central and eastern Sahel, south-central Asia, parts of Greenland and Antarctica, and the far northern regions of North America and Asia, with projected increases in the latter ranging up to 20–30%.

In comparison, the wettest projections remain at up to a 10% increase. In the far north of North America and Asia, the higher end of projected increases in precipitation extends to approximately 40–60%. A few regions are projected to see a shift in the consensus on the sign of the change.

In contrast, in many locations, the 5th to 95th percentile range can include changes that are much larger changes than the median and also changes that are relatively large but opposite in sign. At 4°C global warming, the median projected changes are larger, ranging from a 20% decrease to a 40% increase (excluding very dry areas, where percentage changes can be much larger due to very small baseline values), but nevertheless often remain a poor indicator of the range of changes across the ensemble. Therefore, use of the median or mean projected changes for future adaptation decisions could substantially underestimate the risk of large changes in precipitation. It could mean that the risk of the opposite sign of changes is not accounted for. Indeed, for mean precipitation, different multi-model ensembles can show different levels of significance of the central estimate of change (Uhe et al., 2021: Figure 4.11a).

Elevated CO2 causes stomatal closure which decreases ET, but also increases leaf area index (LAI) which in turn increases ET, but these do not necessarily compensate (Skinner et al., 2017). Higher LAI increases transpiration, depleting soil moisture but increasing shading, thus reducing soil evaporation (Skinner et al., 2017), but LAI may not increase in areas where it is already high (Lemordant et al., 2018). Projected ET decreases from physiological effects alone are widespread but greatest in tropical forests (Swann et al., 2016; Kooperman et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch04_4.4.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Future changes in regional ET are therefore highly uncertain. The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projects changes in ET varying both in magnitude and sign across the ensemble members (Figure 4.14). At 4°C global warming, the ensemble median projection shows increased ET of approximately 25% in mid/high latitudes but decreases of up to 10% across most of tropical South America, southern Africa and Australia. These CMIP6 ensemble projections resemble ET changes projected by the CMIP5 ensemble, except over central Africa and Southeast Asia (Berg and Sheffield, 2019). However, the ensemble ranges are wide and include both increases and decreases in projected ET in many locations, with mid-latitude ET increases being up to approximately 50% and ET decreases in southern Africa being up to approximately 30%. Projected changes are proportionally smaller at lower levels of global warming, while patterns of change remain similar."
wg2_ch04_4.4.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"The relative importance of the physiological and radiative effects of CO2 on future ET is a crucial knowledge gap, partly because many ESM land surface schemes still use representations of this process based on older experimental studies. Furthermore, large-scale experimental studies using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) techniques to constrain the models have not yet been performed in certain critical ecosystems, such as tropical forests. Finally, uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) imply uncertainties in the CO2 concentration accompanying any given level of warming (Betts and McNeall, 2018)."
wg2_ch04_4.4.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, the sign of projected ET change depends on region, but there is medium confidence that ET will increase in the global mean and mid/high latitudes and decrease in northern South America and southern Africa.

AR6 WGI (Douville et al., 2021) draw broadly similar conclusions based on new ESMs, noting that compared to CMIP5, the CMIP6 models project more consistent drying in the Amazon basin, Siberia, westernmost North Africa and southwestern Australia. WGI (Douville et al., 2021) also note that soil moisture in the upper 10 cm shows more widespread drying than in the total soil column."

As in CMIP5 (Cheng et al., 2017), uncertainties are substantial, often associated with uncertainties in projected regional precipitation changes (Section 4.4.1.1), and in most regions, both increases and decreases are projected across the ensemble. In the far north of North America and Asia, projected changes in soil moisture at 4°C global warming range from a 20–30% decrease to an increase of 30–40%. In northern mid-latitudes, projections range from a 10–20% decrease to an increase of 20–30%, except for eastern North America, where the projected changes (both increases and decreases) are less than 10%, and western Europe and the Mediterranean where there is a stronger consensus towards decreased soil moisture of up to 25%. South America, southern Africa and Asia also show a stronger consensus towards decreased soil moisture of up to 40% or more in some regions."
wg2_ch04_4.4.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Most CMIP6 models simulate direct CO2 effects on plant transpiration, which has been shown to be a strong influence on projected future changes in soil moisture (Milly and Dunne, 2016). Approaches that neglect this process project greater decreases in soil moisture availability than the climate models (Roderick et al., 2015; Swann et al., 2016). Therefore, although several studies project increased global aridity and dryland expansion (Feng and Fu, 2013; Sherwood and Fu, 2014; Huang et al., 2016a), these may overestimate future drying (Berg et al., 2017). Nevertheless, land surface models, including vegetation responses to CO2,  still project reduced soil moisture in many regions (Grillakis, 2019)."

For a given level of global warming, the relative importance of climate effects and the direct effects of CO2 on transpiration depend on the CO2 concentration accompanying that level of warming (Betts and McNeall, 2018). Some CMIP6 models have very high climate sensitivities (Meehl et al., 2020), which are assessed as being of low probability on the basis of other lines of evidence (Sherwood et al., 2020). This means that the CO2 concentration accompanying specific global warming levels may be too low and lead to overly large projections of soil moisture decrease in those models."

In all other regions, there is no consensus on the sign of projected soil moisture changes, and projected changes at 4°C global warming include decreases of up to 30% and increases of up to 40%.

AR5 (Collins et al., 2013) and SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) reported with high confidence that permafrost would continue to thaw in the 21st century, but the projections are uncertain. Constraining warming to 1.5°C would prevent the thawing of a permafrost area of 1.5 to 2.5 million km 2 compared to thawing under 2°C (medium confidence) (IPCC, 2018b). AR5 (Collins et al., 2013) and SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) concluded that Northern Hemisphere snow extent and mass would likely reduce by the end of the 21st century, both in plain and mountain regions. AR6 assessed with medium confidence that under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 from 2015 to 2100, glaciers are expected to lose 18% and 36% of their early 21st-century mass, respectively (AR6 WGI, (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021))."

The regional glacier loss rate projections are unevenly distributed worldwide and considerably vary between scenarios (Huss and Hock, 2018; Hock et al., 2019a). In most regions, ‘peak water’ has already been reached or is expected to be reached before mid-century (with an earlier ‘peak water’ for RCP2.6 scenario compared with RCP8.5) (Huss and Hock, 2018; Pritchard, 2019; Marzeion et al., 2020; Rounce et al., 2020). The influence of the expected subsequent decrease in glacier runoff by the end of the 21st century will be more pronounced during droughts and dry seasons (Farinotti et al., 2016; Huss and Fischer, 2016; Hanzer et al., 2018; Brunner et al., 2019)."

Basins where such alternate sources are not available will face agricultural water scarcity (Section 4.5.1). Globally, 1.5 billion people are projected to critically depend on runoff from the mountains by the mid-21st  century under the RCP6.0 scenario (Viviroli et al., 2020). Furthermore, there is medium confidence that projected changes in snow and glacier melt runoff will affect water inputs to hydropower, leading to a decline in hydroelectricity production in mountain basins, for example, in India (Ali et al., 2018), Switzerland (Schaefli et al., 2019) and the USA (Lee et al., 2016) (Section 4.5.2) (IPCC AR6 WGI, 2021) (Sections 9.5.1.3 and 8.4.1.7.1)."

The projected CMIP6 SCE and SWE changes share the broad features of the CMIP5 projections: SCE is expected to decrease in the Northern Hemisphere by approximately 20%, relative to the 1995–2014 mean value, around 2060 and stabilise afterwards under the RCP2.6 scenario, while the RCP8.5 scenario leads to snow cover losses up to 60% by 2100 (Mudryk et al., 2020). Regionally, the SWE loss will probably lead to more frequent snow droughts; for example, the frequency of consecutive snow droughts is projected to increase to 80–100% of years at 4°C warming in western Canada (Shrestha et al., 2021) and 42% of years under the RCP8.5 scenario in the western USA (Marshall et al., 2019) by 2100. Thus, by the mid- to late 21st century, for more than 2/3 of snow-dominated areas in the western USA, the ability to predict seasonal droughts and prepare robust water management plans will decline (Livneh and Badger, 2020) (Section 4.4.5)."

The CMIP5-based equilibrium sensitivity of permafrost extent to stabilised global mean warming is established to be about 4.0 × 106 km 2°C–1 (Chadburn et al., 2017).

WGI further concluded with high confidence that runoff will increase in the high northern latitudes and decrease in the Mediterranean and southern Africa. However, there was medium confidence that runoff will increase in central and eastern African regions and decrease in Central America and parts of southern South America. The magnitude of the change is projected to increase with emissions. There is medium confidence that the seasonality of runoff and streamflow will increase with global warming in the subtropics. In snow-dominated regions, there is high confidence that peak flows associated with spring snowmelt will occur earlier in the year and medium confidence that snowmelt-induced runoff will decrease with reduced snow, except in glacier-fed basins where runoff may increase in the near term."
wg2_ch04_4.4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Changes in runoff and streamflow are projected over most of the ice-free land surface with all recent climate and hydrological model ensembles (Figure 4.16). Changes in streamflow could increase the number of people facing water scarcity or insecurity (high confidence) (Schewe et al., 2014; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; McMillan et al., 2016). Projections of future runoff at basin scales show considerable uncertainty in many regions, including differences in signs in many regions (Figure 4.16). This uncertainty is driven by uncertainties in regional precipitation patterns and hydrological models (Koirala et al., 2014; Asadieh et al., 2016), including vegetation responses to CO2 and its effects on ET (Betts et al., 2015). This uncertainty in future water availability contributes to the policy challenges for adaptation, for example, for managing risks of water scarcity (Greve et al., 2018; Box 4.1). In many regions, some models project large changes in runoff/streamflow but with low consistency between models on the sign of the change (Figure 4.16). In streamflow projections driven by 11 CMIP5 models with the RCP8.5 scenario, strong model consistency (agreement by at least 10 models) is only seen over 21% of global land (Koirala et al., 2014). Consensus on the sign of projected change is smaller with the RCP4.5 scenario."

The consensus on decreased flows becomes stronger for higher GWLs in (for example) the Colorado, Tagus, Helmand, Tigris-Euphrates and Amazon. However, in both cases, some models have projected changes of the opposite sign to the consensus. Moreover, the distribution of projected outcomes becomes notably broader at higher GWLs in (for example) the Mississippi, Yangtze and Amazon. Therefore, even with a strong global climate change signal, uncertainties in changes in mean runoff/streamflow can remain large or even increase. Nevertheless, since projected changes typically increase with global warming, limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C substantially reduces the potential for either large increases or decreases in mean streamflow compared to 3°C or 4°C (Warszawski et al., 2014; Falkner, 2016; Gosling et al., 2017; Figure 4.16) (high confidence)."

Those affected by extreme low flows decrease is projected to remain close to 45% at both 1.5°C and 2°C warming. However, these results are based on the median of the ensemble projections, so they are subject to high uncertainty. At 1.5°C global warming, 15% of the population is projected to be affected concurrently by decreased extreme low flows and increased extreme high flows, increasing to 20% at 2°C warming. In 25 combinations of five CMIP5 climate models and five global hydrological models under the RCP8.5 scenario reaching approximately 4°C GWL at the end of the century, 10% of the global land area is projected to face simultaneously increasing high extreme streamflow and decreasing low extreme streamflow. These regions include the British Isles and the shores of the North Sea, large parts of the Tibetan Plateau, South Asia and western Oceania, and smaller regions of Africa and North and South America, affecting over 2.1 billion people with 2015 population distributions (Asadieh and Krakauer, 2017).

WGI (Seneviratne et al., 2021) also find many consistencies among projections of climate change effects on different forms of drought (meteorological, agricultural/ecological and hydrological drought, 4.2.5), but also significant differences in some regions, particularly in the levels of confidence in projected changes."
wg2_ch04_4.4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Many studies focus on precipitation-based drought indices (Carrão et al., 2018), but higher evaporative demands and changes in snow cover are additional drivers of hydrological, agricultural and ecological drought (medium confidence) in many regions of the world (Koirala et al., 2014; Prudhomme et al., 2014; Touma et al., 2015; Wanders et al., 2015; Zhao and Dai, 2015; Naumann et al., 2018; Cook et al., 2020a). Furthermore, these droughts (hydrological, agricultural and ecological) are often modulated by prevailing soil and hydro-morphological characteristics. Therefore, the choice of drought definition can affect the magnitude and even the sign of the projected drought change."
wg2_ch04_4.4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"In a study with multiple climate models, global water models and scenarios, the choice of drought definition was the dominant source of uncertainty in the sign of projected change in drought frequency in over 17% of global land by 2070–2099, including several major wheat- and maize-growing areas where agricultural (soil moisture) drought is of high importance (Satoh et al., 2021). Cook et al. (2020a) noted that in the CMIP6 projections, soil moisture and runoff drying are more robust, spatially extensive and severe than precipitation, resulting in the frequency of agricultural drought increasing over wider areas than for meteorological drought. At 1.5°C global warming, the likelihood of extreme agricultural (soil moisture) drought is projected to at least double (100% increase) over large areas of northern South America, the Mediterranean, western China and high latitudes in North America and Eurasia (Figure 4.18, left column). The likelihood is projected to increase by 150–200% in these regions at 2°C global warming, with an expansion of the affected areas, and increase by over 200% at 4°C global warming. Agricultural drought likelihood also increases by 100–250% at 4°C global warming in southwestern North America, southwest Africa, southern Asia and Australia. The likelihood of extreme drought is projected to decrease in central North America, the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, the eastern Indian sub-continent and parts of western and eastern Asia. Using eight global hydrological models driven by a subset of four of the CMIP5 climate models, Lange et al. (2020) projected a 370% (30–790%) increase of the global population annually exposed to agricultural (soil moisture) droughts in response to 2°C global warming. Therefore, it is essential to consider the drought type when applying drought projections to impact and risk in decision-making, especially for informing adaptation. For example, if responses are explicitly tailored to agricultural (soil moisture) drought changes, projected changes in a meteorological (precipitation) drought metric may not provide accurate information."
wg2_ch04_4.4.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Compared to CMIP5, the CMIP6 ensemble projects more consistent drying in the Amazon basin (Parsons, 2020), more extensive declines in total soil moisture in Siberia (Cook et al., 2020a) and stronger declines in westernmost North Africa and southwestern Australia. Projected declines in soil moisture in these geographies would cause a significant risk of agricultural drought. Also, importantly, projected changes in drought in many regions depend on the season and may not be evident in annual mean changes. For example, in northwestern Asia, hydrological (runoff) drought frequency is projected to decrease by 50–100% in autumn and winter but increase by up to 250% in spring and summer (Cook et al., 2020a). In contrast, meteorological (precipitation) drought frequency is projected to increase by up to 350% throughout the year."
wg2_ch04_4.4.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Drought projections are subject to uncertainties due to limits of predictability and understanding of the relevant biophysical processes. Uncertainties in regional climate changes are significant in many regions (see Figure 4.10, Figure 4.13, Figure 4.15), and in climate model ensembles, the range of regional outcomes generally increases with global warming. This widening of the range of outcomes can contribute to the increased likelihood of extreme droughts across the ensemble as a whole (Figure 4.18, right column). The response of transpiration to elevated CO2 is also a significant uncertainty. The inclusion of CO2 physiological effects leads to smaller projected increases in agricultural, ecological or hydrological drought (Milly and Dunne, 2016; Yang et al., 2020). However, the level of uncertainties in representing the effects of CO2 is still very high, precluding conclusive results in a global analysis (de Kauwe et al., 2013; Prudhomme et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016). Most CMIP6 climate models include CO2 physiological effects, but many hydrological models used for impacts studies do not."

TWS drought can therefore be considered to be a combination of agricultural, ecological and hydrological drought. The proportion of the global population exposed to TWS drought is projected to increase with ongoing climate change (Figure 4.19). By the late 21st century, under RCP6.0, the global land area in extreme-to-exceptional TWS drought is projected to increase from 3% to 7% (Pokhrel et al., 2021), with increasing uncertainty over time. Combined with a medium population growth scenario (SSP2), this leads to the global population in this level of drought increasing from 3% to 8%, again with increasing uncertainty over time.

Different forms of drought broadly show similar patterns of projected change in many regions (high confidence), but the frequency of agricultural drought is projected to increase over wider areas than for meteorological drought (medium confidence). Clarity on the definition of drought is therefore important for informing decision-making. With the RCP6.0 and SSP2 scenarios, the global population exposed to extreme-to-exceptional terrestrial water storage drought is projected to increase from 3% to 8% over the 21st century."

The relations between climate change and groundwater are more complex than those embedded in current numerical models (Cuthbert et al., 2019b). For instance, groundwater systems register effects of drought with several years of lag effect, and aquifer response times to changes in hydraulic forcing also vary across aquifers (Cuthbert et al., 2019a). For instance, long groundwater response times can buffer drought impacts and lengthen recovery times to sustained drought events (Van Lanen et al., 2013; Opie et al., 2020)."

At the same time, groundwater depletion is projected to increase from approximately 204 (± 30) km 3 year –1 in 2000 to 427 (± 56) km 3 year –1 by 2099 (Wada, 2016). Much of the projected depletion is a function of increased future abstraction of groundwater for irrigation and increased ET (Condon et al., 2020) in a warmer climate. For example, the projected doubling of average water use by 2050 in Tunisia is attributed partly (3.8–16.4%) to climate change and mainly to socioeconomic policies (Guermazi et al., 2019). Similarly, groundwater depletion in the Bengal Basin and North China Plain is more due to irrigation development than climate change per se (Leng et al., 2015; Kirby et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch04_4.4.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"A recent synthesis of modelling studies conducted in various climates showed that out of 33 studies, 21 reported a decrease in the projected groundwater recharge or storage, eight reported an increase and the rest showed no substantial change (Amanambu et al., 2020). A global-scale multi-model ensemble study projected decreasing recharge in southern Chile, Brazil, central continental USA, the Mediterranean and East China, but consistent and increasing recharge for northern Europe and East Africa (Reinecke et al., 2021). In continental Spain, a modelling study (Pulido-Velazquez et al., 2018) projected significant reductions in groundwater recharge in the central and southeast region but a small and localised increase in east and northeastern areas. In subarctic Alaska, increased contribution of glacier melts to streamflow and aquifer recharge under a warming climate is projected (Liljedahl et al., 2017). In contrast, over the Iranian and Anatolia Plateaus, groundwater recharge is projected to reduce by ~77% in the spring season (March–May) due to a decrease in snowfall (Wu et al., 2020). Overall, several recent studies of climate change impacts on groundwater in different parts of the world have concluded that projected groundwater recharge could either increase or decrease, and results are often uncertain (high confidence) (Meixner et al., 2016; Zaveri et al., 2016; Hartmann et al., 2017; Mehran et al., 2017; Tillman et al., 2017; Kahsay et al., 2018; Herbert and Döll, 2019)."

However, the projected irrigation expansion could negate this positive gain in groundwater storage (Sishodia et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). In drylands (e.g., playas in the southwestern USA), where focused groundwater recharge processes dominate, greater recharge is projected to occur from the increased number of significant runoff-generating extreme precipitation events in the future (McKenna and Sala, 2018). Overall, an emerging body of studies have projected amplification of episodic recharge in the tropics and semiarid regions due to extreme precipitation under global warming (medium confidence)."

Projected increase in precipitation intensity and storms can contaminate groundwater by mobilising contaminants such as chemical fertilisers, pesticides and antibiotics and leaching of human waste from pit latrines into groundwater (Amanambu et al., 2020; Lall et al., 2020). By 2050, environmentally critical streamflow is projected to be affected in 42–79% of the world’s watersheds. The majority of these watersheds currently experience intensive groundwater use, and changes in critical streamflow are projected to negatively impact aquatic ecosystems (de Graaf et al., 2019). Using a global synthesis of 9404 data points from 32 countries across six continents, McDonough et al. (2020) report increases in DOC concentrations in groundwater following projected changes in precipitation and temperature. For example, hotspots of high DOC concentration (increases of up to 45%) are associated mainly with increased temperatures in the wettest quarter of the year in the southeastern USA under RCP8.5 scenarios."

However, hydrogeological properties, aquifer settings and impacts of over-abstraction are more important determinants of salinisation of coastal aquifers than slowly rising sea levels (Michael et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2013a). The projected contribution of global groundwater depletion to sea level rise is expected to increase from 0.57 (± 0.09) mm year –1 in 2000 to 0.82 (± 0.13) mm year –1 by 2050, driven by a growing trend in groundwater extraction (Wada, 2016).

There are uncertainties in impact models due to poor representation of recharge pathways (diffuse compared to focused) and inability to adequately capture feedbacks among climate, land use and groundwater systems (Meixner et al., 2016).

Climate change is projected to further exacerbate many of these risks, especially at warming levels above 1.5°C (Figure 4.20). For some sectors and regions, climate change may also hold the potential for beneficial outcomes, though feedback and cascading effects as well as risks of climate extremes are not always well understood and often underestimated in impact projections. Risks manifest as a consequence of the interplay of human and natural vulnerability, sector-specific exposure as well as the climate hazard as a driver of climate change. Challenges to water security are driven by factors across these components of risk, where climate change is but one facet of driving water insecurity in the face of global change. While the focus of this chapter is on climate change and its effects on water security, for many sectors and regions the dynamics of socioeconomic conditions is a core driver. They play an essential role in understanding and alleviating water security risks. The following sections outline sectoral risks for both, risks driven by water-related impacts, such as drought, flood or changes in water availability, as well as risks with effects on water uses, mainly focusing on changing water demand as a consequence of climate change. It therefore does not cover all climate change-driven risks to the respective sectors, but is limited to those that stand in relation to water.

Water-related impacts on global cotton production are highly dependent on the CO2-fertilisation effect, with increases projected for higher CO2 concentration if no water limitations are implemented. However, substantial decreases in cotton production are projected if lower or no fertilisation effects are accounted for due to increasing water limitations (Jans et al., 2018).

Constraining projections of available irrigation water through consideration of environmental flow requirements further reduces the potential for irrigation capacity and expansion (Bonsch et al., 2015).

Projected changes in snowmelt patterns indicate that for all regions dependent on snowmelt for irrigation during warm seasons, alternative water sources will have to be found for up to 20% (at 2°C GWL) and up to 40% (at 4°C GWL) of seasonal irrigation water use, relative to current water use patterns (1986–2015) (Qin et al., 2020).

The elevated CO2 effects are projected to be most prominent for rain-fed C3 crops (Levis et al., 2018). Combined results from field experiments and global crop models show that CO2 fertilisation could reduce consumptive water use by 4–17% (Deryng et al., 2016). To account for uncertainties, global agricultural models provide output with and without account for CO2 fertilisation effects, though recent progress on reducing model uncertainty indicates that non-CO2 model runs may no longer be needed for adequate projections of yield impacts (Toreti et al., 2019)."

Water use efficiency gains through elevated CO2 concentrations have the potential to increase forage quantities, though effects of nutritional values are ambiguous (Augustine et al., 2018; Derner et al., 2018; Rolla et al., 2019). In addition, spatial shifts in temperature/humidity regimes may shift suitable regions for livestock production, opening up new suitable areas for some regions or encouraging shifts in specific breeds better adapted to future climatic regimes (Rolla et al., 2019) (5.5 – Livestock Systems and 5.10 Mixed Systems)."

In the Mekong Basin, the total hydropower generation is projected to decline by 3.0% and 29.3% under 1.5°C and 2°C, respectively (Meng et al., 2021). In this context, 1.5°C will come up in 2036 under RCP2.6 and in 2033, under RCP6.0; and 2°C will come up in 2056 under RCP6.0 (Frieler et al., 2017a). In India, hydropower production is projected to increase by up to 25% by the end of the 21st century due to increased temperature and precipitation under the RCP8.5 scenario. However, hydropower production is projected to decline in plants located in snow-dominated rivers due to earlier snowmelt (Ali et al., 2018). In Colombia, hydropower production is projected to decrease by ~10% under the RCP4.5 dry scenario by 2050 (Arango-Aramburo et al., 2019). In a sub-basin of the Amazon River (one of the hydropower hotspots in Brazil), dry-season hydropower potential is projected to decline by −7.4 to −5.4% from historical baseline conditions under RCP4.5 (Arias et al., 2020). In the São Francisco basin of Brazil, hydropower production is projected to reduce by −15% to −20% by 2100 under the IPCC A1B scenario (de Jong et al., 2018), which will affect the Brazilian energy mix in the future. In Ecuador, under various policy pathways and dry and wet scenarios under RCP4.5, hydropower production is projected to increase by +7% to +21% or decline by −25% to −44% by 2050 (Carvajal et al., 2019).

In Mediterranean parts of Europe, hydropower potential reductions of up to −40% are projected under 3°C warming; while reductions below −10% and −5% are projected under 2°C and 1.5°C warming levels, respectively (van Vliet et al., 2016b; Tobin et al., 2018). Hydropower plants in Switzerland are projected to lose ~1.0 TWh of hydroelectricity production per year by 2070–2090 due to net glacier mass loss in the earlier part of the century (Schaefli et al., 2019). In the Italian Alps, under the warmest scenario of RCP8.4, up to 4% decreases in hydropower production are projected (Bombelli et al., 2019). The magnitude of change differs significantly among models. In California, USA, the average annual hydropower generation is expected to decline by 3.1% under RCP4.5 by 2040–2050, compared to the baseline 2000–2010 (Tarroja et al., 2016).

Nevertheless, some risks, such as floods, will remain unmitigated even with changes in hydropower operation rules (Lee et al., 2016). Overall, impacts of future extreme events on energy infrastructure have been less studied than impacts of gradual changes (Cronin et al., 2018). Furthermore, future hydropower development may also impact areas of high freshwater megafauna in South America, South and East Asia and in the Balkan region, and sub-catchments with a high share of threatened freshwater species are particularly vulnerable (Zarfl et al., 2019).

In the western USA, by 2050, vulnerable power plants are projected to lose 1.1–3.0% of average summer generation capacity, which could rise to 7.2 to 8.8% loss under a 10-year drought condition (Bartos and Chester, 2015). Further, 27% of thermoelectric production in the USA may be at severe risk of low-capacity utilisation due to water stress by 2030 (Ganguli et al., 2017). Thermoelectric plant capacity on the hottest summer day in the USA and EU is projected to fall by 2% under a 2°C global warming and by 3.1% under a 4°C global warming, requiring overbuilding of electricity infrastructure by 1–7% given the current energy mix portfolio (Coffel and Mankin, 2020).

Furthermore, mining activities, which are highly dependent on sufficient water availability, are also at risk due to climate change (Aleke and Nhamo, 2016). Given that some of the intensely mined regions, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, are already water-scarce, even small changes in rainfall could destabilise water-intensive mining operations and affect the production and processing activities at mines (Odell et al., 2018).

In addition, changes in thermotolerance and chlorine resistance of certain viruses have been observed in laboratory experiments simulating different temperatures and sunlight conditions (Carratalà et al., 2020), increasing potential health risks even where traditional water treatment exists (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014) (low confidence). Studies show that degraded water quality increases the willingness to pay for clean water regardless of national economic status. However, payment for clean, potable water, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, can represent a significant percentage of people’s income, limiting economic well-being and the possibility for re-investment in other livelihoods or activities (Constantine et al., 2017; van Houtven et al., 2017; Price et al., 2019)."

However, WaSH systems themselves are vulnerable to extreme events (Section 4.3.3). For example, sewage overflows resulting from heavy rainfall events are expected to increase waterborne disease outbreaks (Khan et al., 2015). High diarrhoeal disease burdens mean that small changes in climate-associated risk are projected to have significant impacts on disease burdens (Levy et al., 2018). For example, up to 2.2 million more cases of E. coli by 2100 in Bangladesh under a 2.1°C GWL are projected (Philipsborn et al., 2016), while up to an 11-fold and 25-fold increase by 2050 and 2080, respectively, under a 2–4°C GWL, in disability-adjusted life years, associated with cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in Canada is projected (Smith et al., 2015). In addition, an additional 48,000 deaths of children under 15 years of age globally from diarrhoea by 2030 are also projected (WHO, 2014). Notably, high levels of treatment compliance and boiling water before consumption offset the projected impact of climate change on giardiasis in Canada in the 2050 scenario, but could not wholly offset the projected impact in 2080 (Smith et al., 2015). Climate change impacts on WaSH-attributable disease burden are also projected to delay China’s progress towards disease reduction by almost 9% under RCP8.5 (Hodges et al., 2014). Disruptions in the drinking water supply can lead to increased household water storage, potentially increasing vector larvae breeding habitats (see Section 3.6.3). In combination with the projected expansion of vector ranges given climate change (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2019), there is the potential for increased risk of vector-borne disease during periods of water shortage or natural disasters (Section 4.3.3). Moreover, energy requirements for water and wastewater treatment are indirectly responsible for GHG emissions, while the breakdown of excreta contributes directly to emissions (Box 4.5, Section 4.7.6).

SR1.5 found with medium confidence that constraining warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C might mitigate risks for water availability, but socioeconomic drivers could affect water availability more than variations in warming levels, while the risks differ across regions (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."

Increasing water demand by cities is already spurring competition between cities and agricultural users for water, which is expected to continue (Garrick et al., 2019) (Section 4.5.1). By 2030, South and Southeast Asia are expected to have almost three quarters of the urban land under high-frequency flood risk (10.4.6).

In addition, increased water temperatures could lead to shifts in the structure and composition of species assemblages following changes in metabolic rates, body size, timing of migration, recruitment, range size and destabilisation of food webs. A review of the impact of climate change on biodiversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems found that under all scenarios, except the one with the lowest GHG emission scenario, freshwater biodiversity is expected to decrease proportionally to the degree of warming and precipitation alteration (Settele et al., 2014) (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch04_4.5.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"These are several examples of such projected changes. Due to higher water temperatures, changes in macroinvertebrates and fish are projected under all future warming scenarios (Mantyka-Pringle et al., 2014). Decreased abundance of many fish species, such as salmonids, under higher temperatures, is also projected, although the effects between species are variable (Myers et al., 2017). Poleward and shifts of freshwater species are projected as they try to stay within preferred cooler environmental conditions (Pecl et al., 2017). Other anticipated changes include physiological adjustments with impacts on morphology with some species shrinking in body size because large surface-to-volume ratios are generally favoured under warmer conditions (Scheffers et al., 2016) and changes in species communities and food webs as a consequence of increases in metabolic rates in response to increased temperatures with the flow-on effects for many ecosystem processes (Woodward et al., 2010). Changes in the seasonality of flow regimes and variability (Blöschl et al., 2019b) and more intermittent flows (Pyne and Poff, 2017) are also projected and could result in decreased food chain lengths through the loss of large-bodied top predators (Sabo et al., 2010) and changes in nutrient loadings and water quality (Woodward et al., 2010). The impacts on freshwater systems in drylands are projected to be more severe (Jaeger et al., 2014; Gudmundsson et al., 2016). Changes to snow and glacier melting, including the complete melting of some glaciers (Leadley et al., 2014; Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017), are projected to reduce water availability and cause declines in biodiversity in high altitudes through local extirpations and species extinctions in regions of high endemism. Lake nutrient dynamics are expected to change, for example, at 2°C warming, and net increase in CH4 emissions by 101–183% in hypereutrophic lakes and 47–56% in oligotrophic lakes in Europe are projected (Sepulveda-Jauregui et al., 2018). Similarly, under the high-GHG emission scenario, lake stratification is projected to begin 22.0 ± 7.0 d earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 d later by the end of this century (Woolway et al., 2021). While overall future trends on climate change on freshwater species and habitats are largely negative, evidence indicates that different species are projected to respond at different rates, with interactions between species expected to be disrupted and which may result in novel biological communities and rapid change in ecological processes and functions (Pecl et al., 2017)."

The consequences for freshwater species are projected to be severe with local extinctions as the freshwater ecosystems dry. In the Americas, under all scenarios that have been examined, the risk of extinction of freshwater species is projected to increase above that already occurring levels due to biodiversity loss caused by pollution, habitat modification, over-exploitation and invasive species (IPBES, 2019).

Yet, since both conflictive and cooperative events are possible under conditions of climatic variability, whether conflict arises or increases depends on several contextual socioeconomic and political factors, including the adaptive capacity of the riparian states (Koubi, 2019), the existence of power asymmetries (Dinar et al., 2019) and pre-existing social tensions (medium confidence)."

In addition, climate-driven water scarcity and increasing crop water demands, including for irrigation, pose additional challenges for agricultural production in many regions (high confidence). Regional water-related risks to agricultural production are diverse and vary strongly across regions and crops (Section 4.5.1). As there are limitations to how well global agricultural models can represent available water resources (Elliott et al., 2014; Jägermeyr et al., 2017), water limitations to agricultural production may well be underestimated.

In the context of water-related adaptation, short-term migration as an income diversification approach is commonly documented. However, permanent relocation and fundamental changes to livelihoods are more transformational and yet can be associated with tangible and intangible losses (Mechler et al., 2019).

This measure features in all continents’ top four adaptation responses except Australasia (Figure 4.27). Especially for rain-fed farming, which currently is the norm in most of Africa, large parts of Central and South America and Europe, water and soil conservation measures and various components of conservation agriculture are some of the most frequently used adaptation responses (Jat et al., 2019). This measure is deemed to have economic benefits and benefits for vulnerable communities who adopt this measure (high confidence) and benefits in terms of water saving and positive ecological and sociocultural benefits (medium confidence). However, this measure can be sometimes maladaptive (low evidence, medium agreement ) and can have mitigation co-benefits (low evidence, high agreement ) (Figure 4.29).

Extra income allows households to re-invest in improved agricultural techniques and improved cultivars (Taboada et al., 2017; Khanal et al., 2018b). Beneficial outcomes are documented in terms of increases in incomes and yields and water-related outcomes (medium confidence, from robust evidence, but medium agreement ), but benefits to vulnerable communities are not always apparent on the whole (Figure FAQ4.4.1). Changes in cropping patterns and systems are also among those adaptation options assessed for their potential to reduce future climate impacts, though effectiveness is shown to be limited (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Paymard et al., 2018). Assessments of the future effectiveness of crop rotation systems for adaptation show a continued reduction in required irrigation water use, though studies of effectiveness beyond 2°C global mean temperature increase are not available (Kothari et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019b) (Figure 4.28 and Figure 4.29)."

Some water-related measures in conservation agriculture include allowing for shading and soil moisture retention, with the co-benefit of reducing pest attacks (Thierfelder et al., 2015; Raghavendra and Suresh, 2018; Islam et al., 2019a). Especially for traditional food grains in small-holder agriculture, improved practices such as modern varieties or integrated nutrient management can play an important role in making production more resilient to climate stress (Handschuch and Wollni, 2016).

While desalination has a high potential in alleviating agricultural water stress in arid coastal regions, proper management and water quality standards for desalinated irrigation water are essential to ensure continued or increased crop productivity. In addition to the energy intensity (Section 4.7.6), risks of desalinated water include lower mineral content, higher salinity, crop toxicity and soil sodicity (Martínez-Alvarez et al., 2018b). Similarly, waste-water reuse can be an important contribution to buffer against the increasing variability of water resources. However, waste-water guidelines that ensure the adequate treatment to reduce adverse health and environmental outcomes due to pathogens or other chemical and organic contaminants will be essential (Angelakis and Snyder, 2015; Dickin et al., 2016) (Box 4.5; 4.6.4)."

While there is extensive documentation on the benefits of migration, the quality of studies is such that links between migration and subsequent benefits are not clear, making our conclusion of benefits from this measure as having medium confidence. On the other hand, there is more rigorous evidence on the maladaptive nature of migration as an adaptation measure (Figure FAQ4.4.1). However, adverse climatic conditions, especially droughts, have been found to reduce international migration, as resources are unavailable to consider this option (Nawrotzki and Bakhtsiyarava, 2017), resulting in limits to adaptation (Ayeb-Karlsson et al., 2016; Brottem and Brooks, 2018; Ferdous et al., 2019).

Training and capacity building are essential tools to ensure effective adaptation in agriculture, increasing food security (Chesterman et al., 2019; Makate and Makate, 2019). Through better understanding, the implementation of available responses reduces exposure to climate impacts.

Freshwater supply systems vary from household or small community systems such as rainwater harvesting systems and private wells to large public water supply systems using surface, groundwater and, in some cases, desalinated water (Alsumaiei and Bailey, 2018b; Falkland and White, 2020). In many cases, communities rely on more than one water source, including a strong reliance on rainwater and groundwater (Elliott et al., 2017; MacDonald et al., 2020). Groundwater resources in freshwater lenses (FWLs) are essential in providing access to freshwater resources, especially during droughts when the collected rainwater is insufficient (Barkey and Bailey, 2017; Bailey et al., 2018), leading to greater risks of water-borne diseases, with significant effects on nutrition (Elliott et al., 2017; Savage et al., 2020), and improper sanitation poses additional risks to the limited groundwater resources (MacDonald et al., 2017). Drought events have also severely affected FWL recharge (Barkey and Bailey, 2017), with extraction rates further threatening available groundwater volumes (Post et al., 2018). In conjunction with sea level rise, this poses serious risks to groundwater salinisation (Alsumaiei and Bailey, 2018b; Storlazzi et al., 2018; Deng and Bailey, 2019). In addition, FWLs are threatened by climate change due to changes in rainfall patterns, extended droughts and wash-over events caused by storm surges and sea level rise (high confidence) (see Chapter 15) (Chui and Terry, 2015; Alsumaiei and Bailey, 2018a; Alsumaiei and Bailey, 2018b; Post et al., 2018; Storlazzi et al., 2018; Deng and Bailey, 2019).

Projections of future freshwater availability in small islands further underline these substantial risks to island water security (Karnauskas et al., 2016; Karnauskas et al., 2018). Population growth, changes in rainfall patterns and agricultural demand are projected to increase water stress in small islands (Gohar et al., 2019; Townsend et al., 2020). While some islands are projected to experience an increase in rainfall patterns, this may refer to shorter intense rainfall events, thereby increasing the risk of flooding during the wet season, while not decreasing their risk of droughts during dry periods (Aladenola et al., 2016; Gheuens et al., 2019). In addition, projected shifts in the timing of the rainfall season might pose an additional risk for water supply systems (Townsend et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Observed adaptation during drought events includes community water sharing (Bailey et al., 2018; Pearce et al., 2018) as well as using alternative water resources such as water purchased from private companies (Aladenola et al., 2016), desalination units (Cashman and Yawson, 2019; MacDonald et al., 2020) or accessing deeper or new groundwater resources (Pearce et al., 2018). Rainwater harvesting to adapt the water supply system in the Kingston Basin in Jamaica was able to significantly alleviate water stress, for example. Still, it would not fill the total supply gap caused by climate change (Townsend et al., 2020). Likewise, groundwater sustainability with increasing climate change in Barbados cannot be ensured without aquifer protection, leading to higher optimised food prices if no additional adaptation measures are implemented (Gohar et al., 2019). The potential of using multiple water sources is rarely assessed in future water supply projections in small islands (Elliott et al., 2017). In the Republic of Marshall Islands, more than half of all interviewed households have already had to migrate once due to a water shortage (MacDonald et al., 2020). In Cariacou, Grenada, increases in migration rates have been observed following drought events (Cashman and Yawson, 2019). with long-term cross border and internal migration shown to be having significant impacts on well-being, community-cohesion, livelihoods and people-land relationships (Yates et al., 2021)."

Changing hydropower operation protocol and plant design can be effective adaptation measures, yet may be insufficient to mitigate all future risks related to increased floods and sediment loads (Lee et al., 2016)."

Therefore, thermoelectric power plants will need additional adaptation measures such as changes in cooling water sources and alternative cooling technologies (van Vliet et al., 2016c). In China, many CFPPs in water-scarce North China have adopted air cooling technologies (Zhang et al., 2016 a). In Europe, wet/dry cooling towers (Byers et al., 2016) and seawater cooling (Behrens et al., 2017) have been the preferred options. Overall, freshwater withdrawals for adapted cooling systems under all scenarios are projected to decline by −3% to −63% by 2100 compared to the base year of 2000 (Fricko et al., 2016) (medium confidence)."

A modelling study from Europe shows that for a 3°C scenario, an energy mix with an 80% share of renewable energy can potentially reduce the overall negative impacts on the energy sector by a factor of 1.5 times or more (Tobin et al., 2018). In addition, hydropower can also play a role in compensating for the intermittency of other renewable energies (François et al., 2014). For example, integrating hydro, solar and wind power in energy generation strategies in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can potentially deliver multiple benefits, including decarbonisation, compliance with environmental flow norms and reduce potential conflicts among Nile riparian countries (Sterl et al., 2021). Furthermore, reducing the share of thermoelectric power with solar and wind energy (Tobin et al., 2018; Arango-Aramburo et al., 2019; Emodi et al., 2019) can be synergistic from both climate and water perspectives, as solar and wind energy have lower water footprints (high confidence)."

As a consequence, hydropower operators face resistance prior to and during construction. Benefit-sharing mechanisms help redistribute some of the gains from hydropower generation to the communities in the immediate vicinity of the project. For instance, sharing of hydropower revenues and profits to fund local infrastructure and pay dividends to local people has been practiced in Nepal and in some countries of the Mekong basin to enhance the social acceptability of hydropower projects (Balasubramanya et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2016) (low confidence)."

In addition, the mining industry has also adopted water adaptations measures, such as water recycling and reuse; using brackish or saline sources; and working with regional water utilities to reduce water extraction and improve water use efficiency (Northey et al., 2017; Odell et al., 2018)."

wg2_ch04_box-4.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Irrigation has consistently been used as a crop protection and yield enhancement strategy and has become even more critical in a warming world (Siebert et al., 2014). Approximately 40% of global yields come from irrigated agriculture, with a doubling of irrigated areas over the last 50 years and now constituting around 20% of the total harvested area (FAO, 2018b; Meier et al., 2018; Rosa et al., 2020b). Thus, irrigation is one of the most frequently applied adaptation responses in agriculture and features centrally in projections of adaptation at all scales. Expansions of irrigated areas over the coming century are projected, leading to shifts from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture in response to climate change (Malek and Verburg, 2018; Huang et al., 2019; Nechifor and Winning, 2019). However, there are regional limitations to this expansion due to renewable water resource limitations, including water quality issues (Zaveri et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2019). Depending on the specific spatial, temporal and technological characteristics of irrigation expansion, up to 35% of current rain-fed production could sustainably shift to irrigation with limited negative environmental effects (Rosa et al., 2020b)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Irrigation increases resilience and productivity relative to rain-fed production by reducing drought and heat stress on crop yields and by lowering ET demand by cooling canopy temperatures (Siebert et al., 2014; Tack et al., 2017; Li and Troy, 2018; Zaveri and B. Lobell, 2019; Agnolucci et al., 2020; Rosa et al., 2020b). Large-scale irrigation also affects local and regional climates (Cook et al., 2020b). While cooling effects, including reduction of the extreme heat due to irrigation, have been observed (Qian et al., 2020; Thiery et al., 2020), increases in humid heat extremes because of irrigation with potentially detrimental health outcomes have also been reported (Krakauer et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2020). For the heavily irrigated North China Plain, a night-time temperature increase overcompensated daytime cooling effects, leading to an overall warming effect (Chen and Jeong, 2018). In addition, modification of rainfall patterns has been linked to irrigation (Alter et al., 2015; Kang and Eltahir, 2019; Mathur and AchutaRao, 2020). For example, increases in extreme rainfall in central India in recent decades has been linked to the intensification of irrigated paddy cultivation in northwest India (Devanand et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Different irrigation techniques are associated with significant differences in irrigation water productivity (Deligios et al., 2019), and replacing inefficient systems can reduce average non-beneficial water consumption by up to 76% while maintaining stable crop yields (Jägermeyr et al., 2015). Several adjustments can improve water use efficiency, including extending irrigation intervals, shortening the time of watering crops or reducing the size of the plot being irrigated (Caretta and Börjeson, 2015; da Cunha et al., 2015; Dumenu and Obeng, 2016). Deficit irrigation is an important mechanism for improving water productivity (Zheng et al., 2018) and increasing regional crop production under drying conditions (Malek and Verburg, 2018). Access to irrigation can also play a role in alleviating poverty, contributing to reducing vulnerability and risks (Balasubramanya and Stifel, 2020). However, the diversity of irrigation-related techniques and the consequent differences in effect and water-use intensity is often underreported (Vanschoenwinkel and Van Passel, 2018)."

However, irrigation currently plays a relatively minor role in most of Africa, except in the contiguous irrigated area along the Nile basin and North Africa and South Africa (Meier et al., 2018). In India, long-term data (1956–1999) on the irrigated area shows that farmers adjust their irrigation investments and crop choices in response to medium-run rainfall variability (Taraz, 2017). da Cunha et al. (2015) report that farmers’ income tends to be higher on irrigated lands in Brazil. In Bangladesh, farmers invest a part of their increased incomes in improving irrigation access (Delaporte and Maurel, 2018). The severity of drought increases the likelihood of farmers adopting supplementary irrigation in Bangladesh (Alauddin and Sarker, 2014). In Vietnam, irrigation improvement had the highest positive impact on crop yield among all farm-level adaptive practices (Ho and Shimada, 2019). In South Africa, access to irrigation was one of the most important predictors of whether or not farmers would adopt a whole suite of other adaptation responses (Samuel and Sylvia, 2019)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Irrigation is also associated with adverse environmental and socioeconomic outcomes, including groundwater over-abstraction, aquifer salinisation (Foster et al., 2018; Pulido-Bosch et al., 2018; Quan et al., 2019; Blakeslee et al., 2020) and land degradation (Singh et al., 2018). Further, while irrigation expansion is one of the most commonly proposed adaptation responses, there are limitations to further increases in water use, as many regions are already facing water limitations under current climatic conditions  (high confidence)  (Rockström et al., 2014; Steffen et al., 2015; Kummu et al., 2016)."

For example, assuming a doubling of global maize production by 2050 increased water productivity could reduce total water consumption compared to the baseline productivity by 20–60% (Zheng et al., 2018). Under economic optimisation assumptions, shifts towards less water-intensive and less climate-sensitive crops would be optimal in terms of water use efficiency and absolute yield increases; however, this could pose risks to food security as production shifts away from main staple crops (Nechifor and Winning, 2019). Shifting currently rain-fed production areas to irrigation will be an important element in ensuring food security with increasing temperatures, though investment in storage capacities to buffer seasonal water shortage will be essential to ensure negative environmental impacts are minimised (Rosa et al., 2020b)."

WaSH interventions have been demonstrated to reduce diarrhoea risk by 25–75% depending on the specific intervention (Wolf et al., 2018) (high confidence). Conversely, inadequate WaSH is associated with an estimated annual loss of 50 million daily adjusted life years (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2019), of which 89% of deaths are due to diarrhoea, and 8% of deaths from acute respiratory infections (Chapter 7 WGII 7.3.2), making universal access to WaSH (i.e., achievement of SDG 6.1, 6.2) a critical adaptation strategy (high confidence). However, not all WaSH solutions are suited to all climate conditions (Sherpa et al., 2014; Howard et al., 2016), so health outcome improvements are not always sustained under changing climate impacts (Dey et al., 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement ). As such, WaSH infrastructure also needs to be climate-resilient (Smith et al., 2015; Shah et al., 2020). In addition to new WaSH infrastructure design and implementation, expansion and replacement of existing infrastructure offer opportunities to implement climate-resilient designs and reduce greenhouse emissions (Boholm and Prutzer, 2017; Dickin et al., 2020) (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch04_4.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Effective adaptation strategies include protecting source water and managing both water supply and demand. Source water protection (Shaffril et al., 2020) has proven effective in reducing contamination. Improved integrated (urban) water resources management (Kirshen et al., 2018; Tosun and Leopold, 2019) and governance (Chu, 2017; Miller et al., 2020) and enhanced ecosystem management (Adhikari et al., 2018b) lead to policies and regulations that reduce water insecurity and, when developed appropriately, reduce inequities (medium confidence). Supply (source) augmentation, including dams, storage and rainwater/fog harvesting, can increase the supply or reliability of water for drinking, sanitation and hygiene (DeNicola et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2015; Majuru et al., 2016; Poudel and Duex, 2017; Lucier and Qadir, 2018; Goodrich et al., 2019) (high confidence). For example, rainwater harvesting in an Inuit community increased water for hygiene by 17%, reduced water retrieval efforts by 40% and improved psychological and financial health (Mercer and Hanrahan, 2017). However, climate change impacts will affect amounts of rainwater available. A recent study concluded that domestic water demand met through rainwater harvesting generally improves under climate change scenarios for select communities in Canada and Uganda, with the exception of drier summers in some areas of Canada (Schuster-Wallace et al., 2021). Further, it is important to recognise that many of these interventions require financial investments that make them inaccessible to the poorest (Eakin et al., 2016). Demand for water can be decreased through reductions in water loss from the system (e.g., pipe leakage) (Orlove et al., 2019) and water conservation measures (Duran-Encalada et al., 2017) (medium confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"During periods of water insecurity, people often implement maladaptive strategies (Magnan et al., 2016), that is, strategies that can increase the risk of adverse health impacts, increase exposure to violence or cause malnutrition (Kher et al., 2015; Pommells et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2019a; Schuster et al., 2020) (medium evidence, high agreement ). Examples include walking further, using less safe water sources, prioritising drinking and cooking over personal/household hygiene, or reducing food/water intake. Conversely, some rebalancing of gender roles can occur when women and girls cannot source sufficient water, with men building additional water supply or storage infrastructure or fetching water (Singh and Singh, 2015; Magesa and Pauline, 2016; Shrestha et al., 2019b). Some adaptation strategies create unintended health threats such as increased odds (1.55) of mosquito larvae in water storage pots (Ferdousi et al., 2015), which could have even more significant impacts in the future given projected range expansion for vectors as a result of climate change (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2019). Other unintended consequences include pathogen contamination (Gwenzi et al., 2015) and time or financial trade-offs (Schuster et al., 2020) (medium evidence, high agreement ). Wastewater reuse for irrigation may have adverse health impacts if wastewater is not treated (Dickin et al., 2016). Conversely, especially where women are responsible for domestic and productive water management, adaptive agricultural water strategies, such as water-efficient irrigation or low-water crops, mean that less water from finite water supplies are used for agriculture, leaving more water locally available for domestic purposes (see section 4.6.2). These co-benefits across sectors become important community water stress adaptations (Chinwendu et al., 2017), with water savings from one use leading to more water available for other uses. This can reduce domestic water burdens and, therefore, gender inequities (Section 4.8.3) (limited evidence, high agreement ). Further analyses of co-benefits, particularly employing a gender lens, are required to improve adaptation strategies (McIver et al., 2016)."

Across the world, existing inequalities deepened due to lockdowns, which further limited access to clean water and education for women and girls, and reinstated gendered responsibilities of child, elderly and sick care, which had been previously externalised (Cousins, 2020; Neal, 2020; Zavaleta-Cortijo et al., 2020). Accordingly, COVID-19 has further steepened the path to reach SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 11 (Lambert et al., 2020; Mukherjee et al., 2020; Neal, 2020; Pramanik et al., 2021). In addition, the pandemic exacerbated food insecurity in drought-affected eastern and southern Africa (Phillips et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2021). As the twin risk of COVID-19 and hurricanes on the US Gulf Coast (Pei et al., 2020; Shultz et al., 2020) and cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh (Pramanik et al., 2021) showed, increased hand washing, additional WaSH and evacuation and shelter infrastructures proved essential for preventing further spread of COVID-19 (Baidya et al., 2020; Ebrahim et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Mukherjee et al., 2020; Pei et al., 2020; Shultz et al., 2020; Pramanik et al., 2021).

An investigation of EbA effectiveness by Reid et al.

wg2_ch04_4.6.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"AR5 concluded with high confidence that challenges for adaptation actions (though not water) are particularly high in regions affected by conflicts (Field et al., 2014a). Although climate–conflict linkages are disputed (Section 4.3.6), the potential for synergies between conflict risk reduction and adaptation to climate change exists (Mach et al., 2019). For example, discourses around climate–conflict inter-linkages can present opportunities for peace building and cooperation (Matthew, 2014; Abrahams, 2020). Indeed, adaptation efforts are needed in the context of conflict, where the pre-existing vulnerability undermines the capacity to manage climatic stresses. In addition, adaptive capacity depends on contextual factors such as power relations and historical, ethnic tensions (Petersen-Perlman et al., 2017; Eriksen et al., 2021), which need to be adequately considered in the design of adaptation strategies."
wg2_ch04_4.6.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Some adaptation options, such as water conservation, storage and infrastructure, voluntary migration, planned relocation due to flood risk/sea level rise, and international water treaties, can reduce vulnerability to climate change and conflicts. However, on the other hand, these adaptation options sometimes may have unintended consequences by increasing existing tensions (Milman and Arsano, 2014); displacing climate hazards to more vulnerable and marginalised groups (Milman and Arsano, 2014; Mach et al., 2019), for example, pastoralists (Zografos et al., 2014); and favouring some over others, such as industry over agriculture (Iglesias and Garrote, 2015)¸ upstream countries over downstream countries (Veldkamp et al., 2017), and men over women (Chandra et al., 2017). Such unintended consequences may happen when adaptation measures intended to reduce vulnerability produce maladaptive outcomes by rebounding or shifting vulnerability to other actors (Juhola et al., 2016). For example, in the Mekong River basin, the construction of dams and water reservoirs contributes to the adaptation efforts of the upstream Southeast Asia countries while increasing current/future vulnerability to floods and droughts in downstream countries and can emerge as a cause of conflict (Earle et al., 2015; Ngô et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch04_4.6.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Furthermore, adaptation in the context of water-related conflicts is also constrained by economic, institutional and political factors, competition for development (Anguelovski et al., 2014) and gender considerations (Sultana, 2014; Chandra et al., 2017), which need to be taken into account when designing adaptation plans/measures."
wg2_ch04_box-4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Circular economies can increase the available sustainable adaptation space by moving away from a linear mode of production of ‘extract-produce-use-discard’ to a ‘4Rs’ closed loop to reduce pollution at the source, remove contaminants from wastewater, reuse treated wastewater and recover valuable by-products (UN Water, 2017; see WGIII 11.3.3)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"It is estimated that 380 billion m 3 of wastewater is produced annually worldwide, which equals about 15% of agricultural water withdrawals. The recovery of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from wastewater can offset 13.4% of the global agriculture demand for these nutrients (Jiménez and Asano, 2008; Fernández-Arévalo et al., 2017). Recycling human waste worldwide could satisfy an estimated 22% of the global demand for phosphorus (UN Water, 2017). It has been estimated that some 36 million ha worldwide (some 12% of all irrigated land) reuse urban wastewater, mainly for irrigation. However, only around 15% is adequately treated (Thebo et al., 2017), thus the need to invest in sustainable, low-cost wastewater treatment to protect public health. The irrigation potential of this volume of wastewater stands at 42 million ha. Wastewater production is expected to increase globally to 574 billion m 3 by 2050, a 51% increase compared to 2015, mainly due to a growing urban population (Qadir et al., 2020). Water reuse with treated wastewater for potable and non-potable purposes can be practised in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment (WHO, 2006; WHO, 2017). For example, when implemented with sufficient treatment standards, the use of recycled water for the irrigation of crops is protective of public health (Blaine et al., 2013; Paltiel et al., 2016), as was determined by an appointed panel of experts in the state of California (Cooper et al., 2012). However, there are several barriers to the adoption of wastewater reuse; these include technical barriers and public health aspects related to microbiological and pharmaceuticals risks (Jiménez and Asano, 2008; Jaramillo and Restrepo, 2017; Saurí and Arahuetes, 2019). These are currently being addressed by strengthening regulatory standards, with, for example, 11 out of 22 Arab States adopting legislation permitting the use of treated wastewater (WHO, 2006; US EPA, 2017; WHO, 2017; EC, 2020). Benefits of wastewater reuse usually outweigh the costs (Stacklin, 2012; Hernández-Sancho et al., 2015; UN Water, 2017)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Desalination is particularly important in arid and semiarid climates, coastal cities and small island states (Box 4.2). There were 16,000 operational desalination plants globally in 2017, with a daily desalinated water production of 95 million m 3 d -1 (IDA, 2020). In 2012, desalinated water was equivalent to 0.6% of the global water supply, and 75.2 TWh of energy per year was used to generate desalinated water; in other words, about 0.4% of the worldwide electricity consumption (IRENA, 2012). Unfortunately, only 1% of total desalinated water uses renewable sources (IRENA, 2012; Amy et al., 2017; Balaban, 2017; Martínez-Alvarez et al., 2018a; Jones et al., 2019) (Section 4.7.6). Desalination has already helped to meet urban and peri-urban water supply, particularly during annual or seasonal drought events, with half of the world’s desalination capacity in the Arab region (UN Environment, 2019; UN Water, 2021). In addition, seawater desalination could help address water scarcity in 146 (50%) large cities (including 12 (63.2%) megacities) (He et al., 2021). Desalination is also being adopted for irrigation. For example, in the island of Gran Canary (Spain), 30% of the agricultural surface area is irrigated with desalinated water to irrigate high-value crops (Burn et al., 2015; Martínez-Alvarez et al., 2018a; Monterrey-Viña et al., 2020). The expected growth of desalination, if not coupled with renewable energy (RE), causes a projected 180% increase in carbon emissions by 2040 (GCWDA, 2015; Pistocchi et al., 2020). There have been advances in large-scale and on-farm renewable desalination (Abdelkareem et al., 2018). Using renewable energy to decarbonise desalination has meant that the projected global average levelled cost of water could decrease from €2.4 m –3 (2015) to approximately €1.05 m –3 by 2050, considering unsubsidised fossil fuel costs (Caldera and Breyer, 2020). Desalination will be maladaptive if fossil fuel is used (Tubi and Williams, 2021)."

Migration is among one of the top five adaptation responses documented in Asia and Africa (Figure 4.27) and confers several benefits to migrants, yet maladaptations are also documented (Figure 4.29). This strategy is not available to everyone. Vulnerable populations exposed to hydrological changes may become trapped due to a lack of economic and social capital required for migration (Adams, 2016; Zickgraf, 2018) (medium confidence)."

Migration is not a viable strategy for everyone, but age, gender and socioeconomic status play a significant role in encouraging or inhibiting the chances of successful migration (Maharjan et al., 2020; Bergmann et al., 2021; Erwin et al., 2021). Migration has increased vulnerability among women and female-headed households (Patel and Giri, 2019), but has also triggered gender-positive processes such as increased female school enrolment (Gioli et al., 2014) (medium confidence). Remittances, that is, transfers of money from migrants to beneficiaries in sending areas, may reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity to climate-induced hydrological changes (Ng’ang’a et al., 2016; Jha et al., 2018b) (medium confidence). Managed retreat refers to the planned and assisted moving of people and assets away from risk areas, such as government- or community-led resettlement (Hino et al., 2017; Maldonado and Peterson, 2018; Tadgell et al., 2018; Arnall, 2019).

However, there is also high confidence that there are significant structural barriers and limits to their adaptation, and that the outcomes of some adaptation strategies can be uneven and maladaptive (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Sections 4.7.4; 4.8.3).

For example, in the Peruvian Andes, concerns about water availability for ritual purposes has led to restrictions on pilgrims’ removal of ice and limiting the size of ritual candles to preserve the glacier (Paerregaard, 2013; Allison, 2015). Relatedly, some local people have questioned the cosmological order and have reoriented their spiritual relationships accordingly (Paerregaard, 2013; Carey et al., 2017). In Siberia (Mustonen, 2015) and northern Finland (Turunen et al., 2016), community-led decisions among herders favour alternative routing, pasture areas and shifts in nomadic cycles in response to changing flood events and permafrost conditions (Box 13.2). However, loss of grazing land and pasture fragmentation pose adaptation limits, and some strategies such as supplementary feeding and new technologies may further affect cultural traditions of herding communities (Risvoll and Hovelsrud, 2016; Jaakkola et al., 2018)."

wg2_ch04_box-4.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Globally, structural measures for flood protection through hard infrastructure are the most common measures as they directly manage flood hazards by controlling flow through streams and prevent water overflow (Andrew and Sauquet, 2017; Duží et al., 2017). These measures include dikes, flood control gates, weirs, dams, storage and proper waste management (Barua et al., 2017; Egbinola et al., 2017). Infrastructure measures require high maintenance, such as dredging and clearing channels and overpasses (Egbinola et al., 2017). A negative aspect of protective infrastructural measures is that, while they eliminate the hazard up to a certain magnitude (Di Baldassarre et al., 2013), they also generate an illusion of no risk by diminishing frequent floods (Duží et al., 2017; Logan et al., 2018). In addition, specific engineering solutions that might be introduced from other localities without proper contextual adjustments may lead to maladaptation (Mycoo, 2014; Pritchard and Thielemans, 2014). NbS (Box 4.6) have shifted infrastructure measures from purely grey onto mixed engineering and environmental measures.

Social support between members of a community and economic mechanisms such as loans or remittances are soft measures that promote recovery or resilience to floods (Barua et al., 2017; Musah-Surugu et al., 2018; Bott and Braun, 2019). Communities with heightened awareness and knowledge of floods are probably going to elect political leaders that will affect flood protection and policies that include adaptation (Abbas et al., 2018). Soft measures can be an anchoring factor for policies that promote early warning systems, infrastructure, flood-resilient housing and environmental restoration (Andrew and Sauquet, 2017; Abbas et al., 2018). However, soft measures, especially at large scale, may also lead to maladaptation, such as lack of synchronisation between international, national and local levels (Hedelin, 2016; Lu, 2016; Jamero et al., 2017), and can further be hampered by bureaucracy (Pinto et al., 2018)."

Aside from the capacity dependent on soft measures and the monitoring infrastructure, communication at all scales, from national weather services to local leaders, needs to be effective for prompt action (Devkota et al., 2014).

For example, initiatives such as ‘Room for the River’ consider flood safety combined with other values such as landscape, environment and cultural values (Zevenbergen et al., 2015). A popular EbA measure has been wetland restoration, which can control flood peaks, serve as storage ponds in addition to restoring the environment (Pinto et al., 2018; Saroar, 2018). However, its effectiveness under different conditions is yet to be assessed (Wamsler et al., 2016). Flood resilient housing is another form of accommodating and living with floods.

Adaptation responses were implemented across all water use sub-sectors assessed in this chapter (Section 4.6, Figure 4.23).

A total of 1054 adaptation responses were documented in the 359 case studies; these were categorised into 16 categories (Figure 4.22). These adaptation responses are not always specific to long-term climate change impacts (that is, changes in annual mean fluxes), but rather respond to changes in variability in the water cycle and specific water hazards.

These top four responses provide several benefits such as higher incomes and yields, better water use efficiencies and related outcomes (high confidence) (Table 4.9 and Figure 4.27). However, those benefits are incremental, that is, they help improve crop production and incomes, at least in the short run, but may not automatically lead to transformative outcomes and climate risk reductions (Pelling et al., 2015; Fedele et al., 2019). One way to move from incremental to transformative adaptation could be to invest gains from incremental adaptation in education and capacity building to improve overall adaptive capacity (Vermeulen et al., 2018). Responses such as migration, including spontaneous and planned relocation, are also relatively well documented (medium confidence), as are responses such as collective action, training and capacity building and economic and financial measures for increasing adaptive capacities (medium confidence). These categories of adaptation can potentially lead to transformative outcomes, such as a shift to livelihoods that are less exposed to climate hazards.

A total of 359 studies were identified to contain sufficiently robust evidence of documented adaptation outcomes to form the basis of this assessment (SM4.2, Table SM4.5; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021a; Mukherji et al., 2021).

wg2_ch04_4.7.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Not all adaptation responses reduce risks, and some may have long-term maladaptive outcomes, even if they are beneficial in the short term.

Of the 319 case studies where adaptation response was found to have some beneficial outcomes, around one third of them also mentioned the possibility of maladaptation. Migration can often have maladaptive outcomes because migration can exacerbate the inherent vulnerabilities of migrants (Section 4.6.8). For example, slum dwellers in cities may earn higher incomes, but their quality of life worsens (Ayeb-Karlsson et al., 2016). In some instances, even wage rates in migration hotspots can remain low due to the high volume of the migrant population (Fenton et al., 2017b); as such, it does not help buffer consumption against rainfall shocks (Gao and Mills, 2018). Migration also has gendered impacts, with girls from migrating families being taken out of school (Gioli et al., 2014) or interrupting children’s education overall (Warner and Afifi, 2014).

Adaptation responses were implemented across all water use sub-sectors assessed in this chapter (Section 4.6, Figure 4.23). Given the overall interest in assessing adaptations that documents outcomes, we limited our analysis to a set of 359 unique articles that measure outcomes of adaptation across pre-defined outcome categories (SM4.2, Table SM4.5; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021a; Mukherji et al., 2021). A total of 1054 adaptation responses were documented in the 359 case studies; these were categorised into 16 categories (Figure 4.22). These adaptation responses are not always specific to long-term climate change impacts (that is, changes in annual mean fluxes), but rather respond to changes in variability in the water cycle and specific water hazards. Adaptation to internal variability is needed to increase the resilience to projected water cycle changes because water cycle changes primarily manifest as changes in variability (Douville et al., 2021)."

Within the agriculture sector, there is high confidence in the quality and quantity of evidence of adaptation responses such as improved cultivars and agronomic practices, on-farm irrigation and water management and water and soil moisture conservation, and medium confidence, derived from robust evidence, and medium agreement  for other most other adaptation responses (Figure 4.23 and Figure 4.24).

Effectiveness is defined as the potential of a given adaptation measure to address projected changes in climate and return the system under analysis to baseline conditions. If the measure cannot fully compensate for the projected climate risk, residual risks remain, defined as the fraction of risk remaining after adaptation. For example, in many regions, projected temperature-driven yield loss can be reduced by shifting to or increasing irrigation.

wg2_ch04_4.7.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"Quantitative projections of future adaptation depend on available impact models to analyse the effect of specific adaptation interventions. However, since not all possible future adaptation responses can be incorporated in climate impact models, this is a major limitation to assessing the full scope of options available in the future. For example, many frequently implemented measures showing effective outcomes, such as behavioural and capacity building-focused responses or migration and off-farm diversification (Section 4.7.1.2), are not incorporated in quantitative water-related climate impact projection models. In addition, projections of future adaptation depend on currently available technologies or approaches, but new methods and technologies will probably emerge. Thus, improving the representation of adaptation in future projections is a significant knowledge gap that remains to be addressed."
wg2_ch04_4.7.2_p16,NO_TITLE,"Whether specific adaptation responses are shown to be effective and even lead to co-benefits or are associated with residual impacts is highly contextually, location- and crop-specific. In addition, the specific climate-impact-scenario combinations play an important role in determining assessed outcomes."
wg2_ch04_4.7.2_p17,NO_TITLE,"In practice, responding to increasing climate risk will need to be context-specific and sufficiently agile to respond to ever-changing realities on the ground. The adaptive pathways approach underline that a sequence of different options responding to climate change over time may be most effective (Babaeian et al., 2021). In addition, impact models generally underestimate or underrepresent climate extremes (Schewe et al., 2019), limiting the ability of the present analysis to reflect adaptation requirements to extremes, which are likely to push systems to their limits (Section 4.7.4). While currently known structural adaptation responses can reduce some of the projected risks across sectors and regions, residual impacts remain at all levels of warming, and effectiveness decreases at higher levels of warming. Adaptation generally performs more effectively at 1.5°C, though residual damages are projected at this warming level across sectors and regions (high confidence). A range of options also shows the potential for further increasing negative effects (maladaptation) across sectors, regions and warming levels, further underlining the need for contextualised approaches."
wg2_ch04_4.7.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Water-related adaptation is being observed across sectors and regions (Section 4.6), and beneficial outcomes are documented across different dimensions (Section 4.7.1). A limited set of frequently documented adaptation responses is also represented in quantitative projections of adaptation effectiveness (Section 4.7.2, Figure 4.29). However, due to the largely different assessment methodologies for measuring beneficial outcomes for current adaptations and effectiveness to reduce impacts for future adaptations, comparing current and future adaptation outcomes is not straightforward. For current adaptation responses, beneficial outcomes may or may not translate to climate risk reduction, making risk reduction potential of observed adaptation a significant gap in our current understanding. The large diversity of outcomes across regions and assessed options becomes apparent for future adaptation options, with the group of ‘inconclusive’ outcomes indicating a large spread of results across regions. This underlines the contextual nature of adaptation and boundary conditions for implementation that can determine the success of adaptation outcomes, now or in the future."
wg2_ch04_4.7.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Documented implemented adaptations show several beneficial outcomes, with most studies (319 of 356) documenting positive rather than negative outcomes. However, there may be a positive reporting bias in the literature, as positive outcomes are more likely to be reported than negative ones. Also, positive outcome in one parameter does not preclude negative outcomes in others, so maladaptation is still possible even when an adaption has some positive benefits (Section 4.7.1.2). In addition, much of the adaptation happening on the ground may not be published in peer-reviewed publications and, therefore, not covered by the literature assessed in this report. Further, there is limited knowledge about the effectiveness of current adaptation in reducing climate-related risks due to documentation and methodological challenges elaborated in Section 4.7.1.2 (SM4.2)."
wg2_ch04_4.7.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"In contrast, evaluating the effectiveness for future projected adaptations is methodologically possible (Section 4.7.2, and SM4.2), but every adaptation that is happening now cannot be modelled for the future. Therefore, projections of future adaptation effectiveness are limited to those options that can be incorporated into (global) quantitative climate impact models. Unfortunately, an extensive range of options, such as capacity building or training, migration and employment, which are essential building blocks in the portfolio of available (water-related) adaptation options, are currently not quantitatively represented in adaptation projections. In addition, the future will probably bring further development in technical solutions, which are currently also not modelled. While implementing the modelled technical options may be feasible in general, several barriers and constraints (Section 4.7.4) and enabling conditions, which influence adaptation action in practice, are not included in current modelling studies. Therefore, the modelling studies may present optimistic assessments of adaptation effectiveness for the future."

For example, beyond a certain level of warming (2°C and upwards), the effectiveness of most options is projected to reduce, and residual impacts are projected to increase. Reduction in the effectiveness of future adaptation at higher global warming levels emphasises the need for limiting warming to 1.5°C, as space for adaptation solution starts to shrink beyond that for most options for which future projections exists (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.7.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"To sum up, there are two significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of water-related adaptations. First, the nature of literature on current adaptation makes it challenging to infer their effectiveness in reducing climate risks, even though the benefits of adaptation are clear (high confidence). Second, not all adaptation responses that are possible in the future can be modelled because of inherent limitations to what can be modelled. Thus, advancement in tools and metrics for measuring the effectiveness of current adaptation in reducing climate risks and suitable downscaled climate and impact models that incorporate economic, social, cultural and management aspects for an extensive range of future adaptation options is needed."
wg2_ch04_4.7.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The core constraints identified in AR5 (Klein et al., 2014) for freshwater-related adaptation were lack of governance, financial resources and information, while water availability was singled out as a core constraint to diversifying options for water-dependent sectors. SR1.5 showed that increasing aridity and decreased freshwater availability, including limited groundwater supply in fossil aquifers in conjunction with rising sea levels may pose hard limits to adaptation for small islands (Roy et al., 2018). SR1.5 also shows that water-related risks can be reduced substantially by limiting warming to 1.5°C (high confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), thereby also reducing the potential to reach hard limits to adaptation. SROCC highlighted that several barriers and limits to adapt to reduced water availability in mountain areas, such as lack of finance and technical knowledge (Hock et al., 2019b). The SRCCL further highlighted the critical importance of water-related climate change adaptation and potential limits to adaptation in the land sector when extreme forms of desertification lead to a complete loss of land productivity (high confidence) (Mirzabaev et al., 2019)."

For example, a lack of institutional support has limited the ability of farmers to implement adaptation, even if information about the benefits is acknowledged (Nambi et al., 2015). A lack of inter-sectoral coordination and communication within institutions and conflicting interests between water sectors limit the potential for integrated policies. For all water-related adaptation options, which have shown to be effective in one or more dimensions (Section 4.7.1.2), governance and institutional constraints were identified to be the most commonly encountered to a moderate or significant extent (Figure 4.30). Water–energy–food nexus approaches can help overcome these inter-sectoral barriers (Box 4.8) (Rasul and Sharma, 2016; Ernst and Preston, 2017). In addition, trade-offs between different policy goals must be considered to ensure the broader significance of the implemented adaptation strategies, such as water quality implication of adaptation efforts in the agricultural or energy sectors (Section 4.7.6) (Fezzi et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch04_4.7.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The lack of financial and technological resources constrains adaptation implementation (Castells-Quintana et al., 2018; Iglesias et al., 2018) and was identified as significant or moderate across all water-related adaptation responses, with significant constraints especially present in options related to the agricultural sector (Figure 4.30). For example, financial resources were significant constraints to implementing Climate Smart Agriculture in Guatemala, a relevant adaptation strategy to improve food security, resilience, and low emission development (Sain et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch04_4.7.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"While financial barriers played an important role in adopting new technologies at the farm level in Spain, acceptance, common understanding and awareness were amongst the most frequently identified barriers across different adaptation options (Esteve et al., 2018). Limitations in knowledge and understanding of complex processes, feedback effects and interconnections in the water sector pose challenges to effective adaptation and adaptation decision-making (Kundzewicz et al., 2018). Such constraints are identified as moderate across the range of options assessed in this chapter (Figure 4.30). For tropical and mountainous regions and the African continent, in particular, significant uncertainties in available data and a lack of reliable climate projections remain one of the biggest obstacles in long-term adaptation planning (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2015), especially in the water sector (Watson et al., 2017; Azhoni and Goyal, 2018; Hirpa et al., 2018; González-Zeas et al., 2019).

In mountain and polar regions, changes in the cryosphere (Sections 4.2.2, 4.4.2) may limit water availability for irrigation systems that depend on melt-water (Section 4.5.1) (Qin et al., 2020). Biophysical limits may also be reached through impacts of hydrological extremes, such as crop loss as a consequence of extreme precipitation events (Huggel et al., 2019; van der Geest et al., 2019). Such limits are reported to a limited to moderate extent across all adaptation options assessed (Figure 4.30). However, knowledge gaps remain about physical and biological constraints to adaptation in the water sector. Climate impacts, such as droughts in East Africa or glacier melt in the cryosphere, indicate that biophysical limits to adaptation may exist, even under current climate conditions (Figure 4.31) (Warner and van der Geest, 2013; Huggel et al., 2019; van der Geest et al., 2019).

In addition, monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation measures, policies and actions can contribute to knowledge, awareness and data to support adaptation implementation in the future (Sections 4.7.1; 4.8) (Klostermann et al., 2018). Although the information on climate change adaptation that has beneficial impacts, including enabling conditions and success factors specific to the water sector, is emerging, significant knowledge gaps remain (Section 4.7.1.2) (Gotgelf et al., 2020).

In Asia, water-related impacts of climate change on all sectors of the economy are projected to reduce GDP by 0.9% (in high-income Asia) to 2.7% (in low-income Asia) by 2050 without adaptation or mitigation. Under the A1B scenario, real GDP is projected to fall by 0.78% by 2030 in South Asia (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014). In Sub-Saharan Africa, damages from floods in 2100 are projected at 0.5% of GDP under a 2°C temperature rise without adaptation; and will be non-uniformly spread across countries (Markandya, 2017; Dottori et al., 2018). In Europe, annual damages due to coastal flooding are projected at €93 billion by 2100 under RCP8.5-SSP3 (Ciscar et al., 2018). Global direct damages from fluvial floods are projected to rise to €1250 billion yr –1 under a 3°C global warming level and SSP5 socioeconomic scenario (Dottori et al., 2018). A model-based study of selected water-related sectors like fluvial and coastal flooding, agricultural productivity of major crops, hydroelectric power generation, and thermal power generation provides much conservative estimates of GDP loss (Takakura et al., 2019). The study shows that without adaptation, loss of global GDP could be 0.094% under RCP8.5 and SSP5 and 0.013% under RCP2.6 and SSP1 scenarios in 2090 (2080–2099), with regional values for Africa (0.017 to 0.286%), Asia (0.015 to 0.104%), Australasia (-0.012 to 0.003%), North America (-0.002 to 0.005%) and South and Central America (0.011 to 0.055%) (Takakura et al., 2019). So, while there is general agreement about negative impacts on GDP due to water-related risks in the future, the magnitude of GDP loss estimates varies substantially and depends on various model assumptions (high confidence).

For example, (Rozenberg and Fay, 2019) estimated that subsidising capital costs to extend irrigation to its full potential would cost 0.13% of the GDP per year of low-and middle-income countries between 2015 and 2030. The coastal and riverine protection cost was between 0.06% and 1% of these countries’ GDP per year over the same period. Projected economic damage due to coastal inundation was USD 169–482 billion in 2100 under RCP8.5-SSP3 without adaptation, but USD 43–203 billion cost to raise dike height will reduce 40% of the total damage (Tamura et al., 2019). Hard infrastructure for river floods, costing $4–9 billion yr –1, can reduce damage by USD 22–74 billion yr –1 (Tanoue et al., 2021). Damages are estimated to be up to six-time larger than the cost of implementing efficient adaptation measures (H2020., 2014). (GCA, 2019) reported that investing USD 1.8 trillion globally, for example, in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure; dryland crop production; mangrove protection; and improving the resilience of water resources between 2020 and 2030 could generate USD 7.1 trillion in benefits."

Conservation agriculture and integrated production systems, early-warning systems, restoration of wetlands, and zoning are postulated to have lower investment and lock-in costs than engineering-based options (Mechler, 2016; Cronin et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020). However, they require regular maintenance and high technical and human capacity, which are likely to vary by scale, location, and context (Chandra et al., 2018; Khanal et al., 2019; Mutenje et al., 2019; Rahman and Hickey, 2019). Global studies suggest improvements in returns on adaptation investments by delivering better services and reducing water wastage through appropriate water pricing and regulations (Damania et al., 2017; Bhave et al., 2018). For example, under scenarios SSP1 and SSP3, water pricing and regulation are projected to reverse losses in expected 2050 global GDP of 0.49% to gains of 0.09%. GDP losses are projected to drastically reduce in the Middle East, eliminated in the Sahel and Central Africa, and reversed into gains in Central Asia and East Africa, with benefits concentrated in worst-affected regions (World Bank, 2016). More local and national studies are needed to identify low regret options and their benefits and actual costs (Blackburn and Pelling, 2018; Abedin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2019; Momblanch et al., 2019; Page and Dilling, 2020) (limited evidence, high agreement )."

Still, more work needs to be done on actual benefits and costs of adaptation strategies and residual impacts and risks of delaying adaptation action (medium confidence). In addition, better evidence on the costs and benefits of low-regret solutions, such as water pricing, increasing water use efficiency through technology and service improvements, and enhanced support for autonomous adaptation, is also needed for informed decision-making (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_box-4.8_p1,NO_TITLE,"The WEF nexus is an approach that recognises that water, energy and food are linked in a complex web of relationships in the hydrological, biological, social, and technological realms (D’Odorico et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b; Märker et al., 2018). For instance, agricultural production requires significant energy inputs due to intensive groundwater pumping (Siddiqi and Wescoat, 2013; Gurdak, 2018; Putra et al., 2020). Similarly, hydropower production often has trade-offs with irrigation, affecting food production, carbon emission and forest protection (Meng et al., 2020). New technologies, such as desalination plants for urban water supply against future climate change and drought, are also very energy-intensive (Caldera et al., 2018) (Box 4.5). Quantifying the complex interdependencies among food, energy and water is critical to achieving the SDGs and reducing trade-offs (Liu et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2018b; UN, 2019). A key benefit of the nexus approach is to leverage the interconnection of WEF and achieve the most efficiency in the overall systems. Hence, this approach allows for widening the set of salient stakeholders and, therefore, solution possibilities that may otherwise not be possible in single-domain efforts and helps connect these stakeholders to achieve synergistic goals (Ernst and Preston, 2017; Mercure et al., 2019)."

Policies and strategies aiming to cope with climate change may amplify rather than reduce negative externalities and trade-offs within the nexus: low carbon transition, the shift to non-conventional water resources, and agricultural intensification, all implemented to mitigate and adapt to climate change, are not always nexus-smart. Hence, a nexus approach that integrates management and governance across these three sectors can enhance WEF security by minimising trade-offs and maximising synergies between sectors. At the same time, renewable energy offers the opportunity to decouple water and food production from fossil fuel supply, leading to several advantages from both a socioeconomic and environmental point of view (Cipollina et al., 2015; Pistocchi et al., 2020). WEF nexus approaches can achieve overall system efficiency when maximising the use and recovery of water, energy, nutrients and materials (Pistocchi et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2021). These types of holistic system thinking of WEF show promising strategies to catalyse transformative changes. Suppose that the specific types and extent of WEF linkages in a region are well understood. In that case, it becomes possible to intervene through one element to cause an effect on another connected component that may have proven difficult for direct intervention (Mukherji, 2020)."

There are recent signs of progress in developing models and tools for addressing the nexus trade-offs, for example, the bioenergy–water nexus (Ai et al., 2020).

In addition, SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC, 2018a) and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019b) reiterated the challenge of trade-offs that may undermine sustainable development.

In Asia, the near-term mitigation scenario with high CCS deployment increases the average regional water withdrawal intensity of coal generation by 50–80% compared to current withdrawals (Wang et al., 2019b). Carbon can be ‘scrubbed’ from thermoelectric power plant emissions and injected for storage in deep geological strata (Turner et al., 2018), but this can lead to pollution of deep aquifers (Chen et al., 2021) and have health consequences (low confidence)."

Evaporative losses from biomass irrigation and thermal bioelectricity generation are projected to peak at 183 km 3 yr –1 in 2050 under a low overshoot scenario (Fuhrman et al., 2020).

Both BECCS (Muratori et al., 2016) and DAC can significantly impact food prices via demand for land and water (Fuhrman et al., 2020).

An additional 0.9 billion ha of canopy cover in suitable locations could store 205 Gt of carbon (Bastin et al., 2019), but this estimate is deemed unrealistic. Aggressive afforestation and reforestation efforts can result in trade-offs between biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and water use (Smith et al., 2008). In northern China, ecological restoration by regreening drylands resulted in several environmental and social benefits (Mirzabaev et al., 2019) but also led to increased freshwater use in some pockets (Zhao et al., 2020 ). Afforestation and reforestation with appropriate broad-leaf species in temperate Europe (Schwaab et al., 2020) can offer water quality and quantity-related benefits, mitigate extreme heat, and buffer against drought (Staal et al., 2018). A global assessment on forest and water showed that forests influence the overall water cycle, including downstream water availability via rainfall-runoff dynamics and downwind water availability via recycled rainfall effects (Creed and van Noordwijk, 2018). The study concluded that afforestation and reforestation should be concentrated (Ellison et al., 2017) in water-abundant locations (to offset downstream impacts) and where transpiration can potentially be captured downwind as precipitation (Creed et al., 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2).

SDG1 (no poverty) is statistically linked to SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) (Pradhan, 2019), since reducing poverty can help increase adaptive capacity in line with the Paris Agreement adaptation goals (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 18). SDG2 (zero hunger) cannot be achieved without access to adequate water for agriculture.

Water is inextricably entwined with land and ecosystems transitions, with forested areas and ecosystems being integral components of the water cycle, regulating streamflow, fostering groundwater recharge and contributing to atmospheric water recycling (Takata and Hanasaki, 2020) (Section 4.2). However, mitigation action of large afforestation, can have negative water impacts (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 5 of WGI report, 4.7.6), making it imperative to consider water footprint of land- and forest-based mitigation (Muricho et al., 2019; Seddon et al., 2020) (Section 4.7.6). Sustainable forest management and NBS are promising alternatives for good water management (Muricho et al., 2019; Seddon et al., 2020). Water will also play a crucial role in sustainable urban transitions. Cities are already facing water-related impacts (Section 4.3.4), which are projected to intensify with every degree of global warming (Flörke et al., 2018; Nazemi and Madani, 2018) (Section 4.5.4). Mitigation and adaptation measures in urban spaces, such as green infrastructure (Liu and Jensen, 2018), sustainable water supply management through recycling of wastewater and storm water runoff (Box 4.5) and NbS like sponge cities, are fundamentally about water (Box 4.6)."

Water management in agriculture has long seen the use of technology. For example, the use of technology to improve access to water, for example, through the diffusion of groundwater pumps in the 1970s in South Asia, had several livelihood benefits, but made agriculture more carbon-intensive (Zaveri et al., 2016). More recently, technology has been used to improve water use efficiency in agriculture through the adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation (Zhuo and Hoekstra, 2017; Grafton et al., 2018), and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) (Keswani et al., 2019). In addition, innovations to reuse water through various wastewater recovery technologies (Diaz-Elsayed et al., 2019; Capodaglio, 2020), create potable water through desalinisation (Caldera et al., 2018) and reuse of wastewater in agriculture (Salgot and Folch, 2018) are also on the rise (Box 4.5).

Similarly, within the urban adaptation landscape, which got ~3–5% of total adaptation finance flows of USD 30.8 billion tracked in 2017–2018 (Richmond et al., 2021), water and wastewater management projects received the largest share of urban adaptation finance (USD 761 million annually) followed by disaster risk management (USD 323 million) (Richmond et al., 2021). However, more frequent tracking of public financing is required, with a greater focus on transparency and accountability (Ciplet et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2020) and justice and social equity (Emrich et al., 2020) (also see Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17)."

Not all water adaptation strategies are accessible to the poorest, who may turn to maladaptive strategies if their access to water is negatively affected (Eakin et al., 2016). Consequently, there have been calls for mainstreaming equity considerations into adaptation (Blackburn and Pelling, 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement ).

In most societies in developing countries, women and girls are in charge of fetching water. The necessity of water collection takes away time from income-generating activities and education (high confidence) (Fontana and Elson, 2014; Kookana et al., 2016; Yadav and Lal, 2018). In addition, the distances women and girls would have to walk as a result of growing water scarcity due to climate change may increase (limited evidence, high confidence) (Becerra et al., 2016) (Sections 4.3.3, 4.5.3).

Notably, women are not a homogenous group, and local gender roles are not immutable or generalisable (Carr and Thompson, 2014; Djoudi et al., 2016; Gonda, 2016; Sultana, 2018). Coping responses and adaptation mechanisms to climate change are profoundly gendered. Women and men approach the diversification of agricultural and pastoral livelihoods differently in response to climate change (Caretta and Börjeson, 2015; Kankwamba et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Basupi et al., 2019). For example, reliance on women’s self-help groups and associations has proven successful in ensuring women’s participation in decision-making in adaptation interventions as a response to climate change-induced shifting precipitation patterns and increasing droughts (Chu, 2017; Mersha and van Laerhoven, 2018; Phuong et al., 2018; Walch, 2019). Studies feature water harvesting, crop diversification, cash transfer programmes and food subsidies as adaptation measures that enhance gender equality. Adaptation to climate change in these instances promoted gender equality because it allowed women to reap the benefits of these new measures in terms of economic and health well-being (Tesfamariam and Hurlbert, 2017; Lindoso et al., 2018; Walch, 2019)."

Furthermore, integrating the principle of gender inclusivity in adaptation is morally and ethically appropriate and effective because women hold much of the local and TK in many agricultural communities and can fruitfully provide insights on how to design and implement adaptation responses (Fauconnier et al., 2018; James, 2019)."

In Galena, Alaska (USA), a flood-preparedness and response programme has benefitted from the long-term cooperation between emergency management and tribal officials (Kontar et al., 2015) (12.5.3.2 Main concepts and approaches). IKLK can enhance the visibility of Indigenous Peoples and local communities that are excluded from official decision-making processes.

Indeed, cooperation at the international level is less probable to occur if participants do not trust each other (Hamilton and Lubell, 2018). In climate-related water adaptation, transboundary cooperation is essential, as 60% of global freshwater resources contained in 276 river and lake basins are shared between countries (Timmerman et al., 2017).

Moreover, although the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/70/1) makes it clear that without the participation of local communities (e.g., SDG6, Target 6b) and women (e.g., SDG5, Target 5.5), the SDGs will not be met; the involvement of these actors in formal water governance processes and water management is still limited (Fauconnier et al., 2018). This is due partly to the absence, in many regions of the world, of adequate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks for effective stakeholder participation, partly to the influence of local social and cultural contexts, which can discourage inclusive water governance (Andajani-Sutjahjo et al., 2015; Dang, 2017). Yet, inclusion and effective participation in bottom-up decision-making processes of those disproportionately affected by climate change—including women and Indigenous Peoples—is particularly important to ensure the legitimacy and inclusiveness of the decision-making process and the design of socially just adaptation actions (Shi et al., 2016).

These, in turn, can produce better environmental outcomes and improve water governance outcomes (high confidence). Polycentric water governance can be an effective enabler for adaptation when it ensures interconnectedness with multiple public and private actors across the different sectors (e.g., irrigation users, domestic users, industrial users, watershed institutions, etc.) and across different levels (e.g., local, regional and national governments) to help come up with well-coordinated water adaptation responses (high confidence) (Pahl-Wostl and Knieper, 2014; McCord et al., 2017; Baldwin et al., 2018; Hamilton and Lubell, 2018; Kellner et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.8.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"Questions remain about the extent to which polycentrism can result in either greater climate justice or exacerbate existing inequalities due, for example, to existing power inequalities which may affect the performance and effectiveness of a polycentric system (Pahl-Wostl and Knieper, 2014; Morrison et al., 2017; Hamilton and Lubell, 2018; Okereke, 2018). For instance, historical inequities and injustices due to settler colonialism and top-down water policies, governance and laws (Collins et al., 2017; Arsenault et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2018; Robison et al., 2018) have resulted in long-term water insecurity in many indigenous communities in North America (Simms et al., 2016; Medeiros et al., 2017; Conroy-Ben and Richard, 2018; Diver, 2018; Emanuel, 2018) (high confidence) (Section 4.6.9). Additionally, studies highlight that power dynamics can undermine the success of those initiatives. For example, in the Sao Paulo water crisis, polycentric governance did not fully realise its potential when it was guided by authoritarian governance favouring political interests over social, territorial and environmental justice (Frey et al., 2021). Likewise, in the Thau basin (France), the most important and influential actors shaped policy measures in response to climate change, thus limiting the potential for radical changes in water use (Aubin et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch04_4.8.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"In summary, polycentric governance can enable improved water governance and effective climate change adaptation (medium confidence). However, it can also exacerbate existing inequalities as long as less powerful actors, such as women, Indigenous Peoples and young people, are not adequately involved in the decision-making process (high confidence)."
wg2_ch04_4.8.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"According to AR5 (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014), barriers to adaptation in the water sector include lack of institutional capacity, which, together with political support, constitutes one of the feasibility dimensions towards limiting global warming to 1.5°C (de Coninck et al., 2018). As the IPCC SROCC (IPCC, 2019a) and SRCCL (Shukla et al., 2019) suggest, limited institutional support can challenge adaptation efforts in water management."
wg2_ch04_4.8.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate adaptation planning approaches can be constrained by several economic, institutional, developmental and political barriers (Anguelovski et al., 2014; Eisenack et al., 2014), including strong political support, that is, the lack of collective willingness to take action. Despite the ongoing accumulation of scientific evidence as to the seriousness of the impact of climate change on water resources, state action has not always been effective. There are now a rising number of case laws addressing the state’s failure to implement adaptation policies and resultant climate change litigation (Setzer and Vanhala, 2019; Peel and Osofsky, 2020), including in the water sector, as in the leading case Leghari v Federation of Pakistan (2015 WP. No. 25501/201), in which a farmer sued the national government for failure to carry out national climate change policies impacting on the constitutional right to life (Preston, 2016)."
wg2_ch04_4.8.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"The 2015 Paris Agreement made a significant impact on the status quo, with almost all the countries agreeing to limit global warming to 2°C or less. The preparation of NDCs under the Paris Agreement contributed positively to national climate policies and helped focus on the centrality of water in adaptation planning (Röser et al., 2020). In total, 92% of countries that mention adaptation in NDCs also include water (GWP, 2018). Low-income countries make specific reference to rain-fed or irrigated agriculture and livestock. In contrast, middle- and high-income countries include developing management, governance mechanisms and increased disaster risk reduction in their NDC pledges (GWP, 2018). Floods were the critical climate hazards identified in the adaptation components of NDCs, followed by droughts (85 out of 137 countries for floods and 80 out of 137 for drought). Also, the water sector was identified as the top priority sector for adaptation actions in the NDCs for 118 out of 137 countries, followed closely by the agricultural sector with 100 out 137 (GWP, 2018) based on data from UNFCCC (2017). Many developing countries have included quantitative targets for adaptation in the water sector (Pauw et al., 2018). Similarly, water-related impacts and adaptation often feature prominently in NAPs (DEFRA, 2018)."
wg2_ch04_4.8.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"Evidence suggests that adaptation failure in the water sector is due to policy and regulatory failures (Keohane and Victor, 2016; Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018; Javeline et al., 2019), reflecting political myopia (Muller, 2018; Empinotti et al., 2019; Pralle, 2019) (high confidence)."

wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change can affect these different dimensions of water security in different ways. Most directly, climate change is affecting the overall availability of water across regions and during important seasons. More extended periods of dry spells and droughts are already affecting water availability, especially in the arid areas of India, China, the USA and Africa. Other extremes, such as heavy precipitation and flooding, can affect water quality, making water unsafe for drinking, for example. In coastal regions and small islands, the combined effects of higher sea levels and more intense storms affect water security by increasing the salinisation of groundwater resources. Indirect effects of climate change on water security include impacts on infrastructure for the provision and recovery of water resources, which can affect the safe access to adequate water resources, both in terms of quality and quantity."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"In terms of assessing the extent of water scarcity, studies estimate that currently, between 1.5 and 2.5 billion people live within areas exposed to water scarcity globally. These numbers are projected to increase continuously, with estimates of up to 3 billion at 2°C and up to 4 billion at 4°C by 2050. Many socioeconomic factors, such as population growth and food consumption patterns, determine water scarcity. Still, climate is increasingly shown to be an important component that drives scarcity across the world. Water scarcity is often a seasonal occurrence, and climate change is projected to increase seasonal extremes. Often, consecutive years with drier conditions lead to a long-term decrease in groundwater tables, affecting water availability directly and soil moisture in the longer term."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"As an essential component of water security, climate change will affect water quality in different ways. Drier conditions lead to a reduction in water availability, causing a potential increase in the concentration of contaminants. Increasing runoff and floods can wash pollutants into water bodies. With climate change projected to increase the variability of rain over space and time, such impacts on water quality are becoming increasingly likely . Higher temperatures add to deteriorating water quality by reducing oxygen levels."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Another critical component to ensure secure access to water resources is adequate water infrastructure for access, disposal and sanitation. Unfortunately, increasing extremes due to climate change, especially floods and increasing storm activity, have great potential to damage such infrastructure, especially in developing world regions, where infrastructure is much more susceptible to damage and pollution."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"There are substantial differences in the distribution of risks across regions, with some areas facing a much higher risk burden than others. Also, projections of the potential impacts of climate change on water security vary across regions. However, patterns of projected water-related extremes are emerging more clearly globally with increasing confidence."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Some parts of the world are becoming wetter, and some are becoming drier, in terms of either changes in precipitation and/or the water available in the soil, in rivers or underground. Soil moisture, river water and groundwater are affected by changes in precipitation and also by changes in evaporation, which is affected by temperature and by uptake by vegetation."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"All these factors are affected by climate change. Rising temperatures drive higher evaporation, which dries the landscape, although this can be offset in some areas by reduced uptake of water from the soil by plants in response to rising CO2 concentrations. A warming climate brings more precipitation overall, although changes in global wind patterns mean that some areas are seeing less precipitation."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"As a result, substantial numbers of people are now living in climates with average precipitation levels significantly different to the average over the 20th century. Nearly half a billion people are living in unfamiliar wet conditions, mostly in mid- and high latitudes, and over 160 million in unfamiliar dry conditions, mostly in the tropics and subtropics (Figure FAQ4.2.1)."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"In addition to changes in average precipitation, the patterns over time are also changing, such as the length of dry spells and the amount of precipitation falling in heavy events. Again, these changes vary across the world due to shifting wind patterns. Approximately 600 million people live in places with longer dry spells than in the 1950s, mostly in West Africa, south Asia and parts of South America. Approximately 360 million people experience shorter dry spells, in North America, northern Asia and other parts of South America."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In contrast, far more people (about 600 million people) are seeing heavier precipitation than less heavy precipitation (80 million). A more widespread increase in heavy precipitation is expected in a warming world, where the warmer atmosphere takes up more moisture and hotter ground drives more intense storms."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"River flows are also changing in many parts of the world, often due to changes in precipitation, although direct human impacts are also important. Generally, the most widespread increased river flows are seen in high latitudes, while decreasing flows are seen in mid- and low latitudes, although there are major exceptions to these trends and data is sparse in many regions (Figure FAQ4.2.2)."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Some of these changes are starting to have impacts on society. For example, increasing rainfall in the USA has led to increased crop yields. Heavy rainfall and long periods of rainfall lead to flooding, causing deaths, injuries, infrastructural damage, spread of disease, disruptions to employment and education, psychological trauma and territorial displacement. The weather conditions associated with many recent major flooding events were made more likely  by climate change, although non-climatic factors remain the dominant driver of increased flooding."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Drier soils have made heatwaves more severe. A drying of the landscape has increased the length of the fire season across much of the world, contributing to unprecedented severity of wildfires in recent years. In recent years, several major drought events with impacts on agriculture were made more likely  by climate change."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Overall, the general picture is of increased average precipitation and/or longer periods of precipitation in the mid and high latitudes, but decreased precipitation and/or longer times between precipitation across much of the tropics and subtropics. Where heavy precipitation is changing, this is mostly towards increasing intensity. Societal impacts and increased risks from both wetter and drier conditions are starting to emerge."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.2_p13,NO_TITLE,FAQ 4.2
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Anthropogenic land use changes and climate change will exacerbate the intensity, frequency and spatial extent of floods and droughts, leading to populations becoming more vulnerable. According to projections, these increases in extreme events will be more significant with higher levels of global warming. However, the location and severity of floods and droughts are context-dependent and complex phenomena."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The processes that lead to droughts include lack of or less frequent precipitation, increased evapotranspiration and decreased soil moisture, snow cover, runoff and streamflow. For example, warming temperatures may result in higher evapotranspiration, in turn leading to drier soils. In addition, reduced soil moisture diminishes the amount of water filtering into rivers in both the short and long term while also increasing the aridity that can foster the conditions for fire. Moreover, decreased snow cover represents less runoff supply to downstream areas during warmer seasons. Depending on this process and the propagation of a meteorological drought onto further systems, a drought can be defined as hydrological, agricultural or ecological. Agricultural drought threatens food production through crop damage and yield decreases, and consequent economic impacts, and therefore, can be the most impactful to humans. Geographically, the likelihood of agricultural drought is projected to increase across most of southern Africa, Australia, the majority of Europe, the southern and western USA, Central America and the Caribbean, northwest China, parts of South America, and the Russian Federation; but due to increased precipitation, it is projected to decline in southeastern South America, central Africa, central Canada, western India and the south of the Arabian Peninsula."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Flood hazard natural processes usually result from increases in heavy precipitation events, but they can also be caused by saturated soils, increased runoff and land use changes. A warming climate usually causes greater energy for the intense upward motion for storm formation and increases evapotranspiration, which leads to heavier precipitation. Many places around the world will experience more-than-average rainfall, which may increase soil moisture. Wetter soils saturate faster during precipitation events, resulting in increased runoff that can muddy the waters and lead to floods. Anthropogenic land use changes, such as urbanisation, deforestation, grasslands and agricultural extension, can also reduce the amount of water infiltrating the soil and leading to frequent flooding. Floods are expected to increase in Asia, the USA and Europe, particularly in areas dependent on glacier water where melting will lead to earlier spring floods. Additionally, fluvial floods are projected to be more frequent in some regions in central Africa and northern high latitudes and less frequent in the southern areas of North America, southern South America, the Mediterranean, parts of Australia and southern parts of Europe."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Globally, socioeconomic development will lead to heightened societal hazards. Due to population growth and increased urbanisation, floods and droughts will affect more people in the course of this century, especially if warming cannot be limited to 1.5°C. All losses, both in lives and in economic terms, will be more limited in a 1.5°C than in a 3°C warmer world. The impacts of floods and droughts are expected to increase across all economic sectors, from agriculture to energy production, resulting in negative outcomes for our global production of goods and services, industry output, employment, trade and household consumption. Landslides, sinkholes and avalanches arising from heavy rainfall events will increasingly threaten infrastructure and agricultural production. In cities, increased flood frequency could disrupt waste management systems, resulting in the clogging of waterways. In addition, unprecedented flood magnitudes could overwhelm hydraulic infrastructure, affecting the energy, industry and transportation sectors. An expansion in inundation area, coupled with urban sprawl, would increase flood damage. Floods will pose additional risks to people’s lives and health through inundation, thus facilitating the spread of waterborne diseases. At the same time, drought can have adverse health impacts due to the limited availability of food and water for drinking and hygienic purposes. Although there are no agreed-upon projections for migration and displacement due to water-related disasters, it is known that drought and desertification cause harvest failures, which may lead subsistence farmers to relocate to urban areas. Whether temporary or permanent, displacement is often mired with diminished safety, loss of social ties, and a weakened sense of place and cultural identity."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Finally, vulnerable groups such as people living in poverty, women, children, Indigenous Peoples, uninsured workers and the elderly will be the most affected by water-related disasters."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Worldwide, and especially in developing countries, agriculture (including crop cultivation and livestock and fisheries) is the largest water user, accounting for 50–90% of all water use. Moreover, a substantial part of the water used in agriculture is ‘consumptive’ use, which means that the water is ‘consumed’ for crop growth and is not immediately available for other uses. This is different from other sectors, such as energy production, where only a fraction of the water is consumed, and other downstream users can reuse the rest. Agriculture also accounts for a large share of employment in developing countries, with 60–80% of the rural population dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Agriculture provides food security for all. This makes farmers and agriculture particularly vulnerable to climate change."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Climate-induced changes in the global hydrological cycle are already impacting agriculture through floods, droughts and increased rainfall variability. For example, loss in yields has been reported for major crops such as maize (by 4.1%), soybeans (by 4.5%), rice (by 1.8%) and wheat (by 1.8%) due to changes in precipitation between 1981 and 2010. In addition, drought has affected both the area under cultivation and the yields of major crops. According to one estimate, globally, there has been a loss of 9–10% of total cereal production due to droughts and other weather extremes. Similarly, floods are one of the significant reasons for crop losses worldwide. Climate change-induced losses in livestock and fisheries have also been documented. In some parts of the world, especially in cold temperate zones, agro-climatic zones have become more conducive to yield growth in crops like maize and soybean due to increases in summer precipitation. Yet, negative impacts far outweigh positive impacts."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Projected impacts on agriculture due to changes in water availability are also severe. For example, yields of rain-fed crops such as maize are projected to decline by one fifth to one third by the end of the century. In contrast, many areas which currently support multiple crops may become unsuitable for rain-fed farming or support only one crop in a year. Irrigation, which is often one of the most effective adaptive strategies against water-induced stress, is also projected to be affected by a reduction of the amount of water available for irrigation in some parts of the world that are already water-stressed or as a result of groundwater depletion in places such as India, North China and the northwestern USA. Overall, future droughts and floods will pose a major risk to food security, and agriculture and impacts will be more severe on countries and communities that are already food insecure."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Given that farmers are already dealing with variability in the amount and timing of rainfall. In many places, demand for agricultural water is greater than supply, and farmers are using many adaptations and coping strategies to meet water demands for their crops, fish and livestock. Some of the most popular adaptation responses around crops and water include:"
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Most of these measures are beneficial across multiple indicators (water saving, increased incomes, etc.); however, whether they also reduce climate-related risks is not well understood and remains a knowledge gap. Irrigation and changes in crop choices and cultivars are also shown to be effective for future adaptation, especially at 1.5°C global warming, but much less effective at 2°C and 3°C when these responses will not mitigate a large part of the climate risk. Most of these adaptation measures mentioned above are autonomous. However, some, such as improved seeds and cultivars, are supported by national agricultural research agencies, international research coalitions such as the CGIAR [Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research], and private seed companies. In many parts of the world, farmers are also increasingly using IKLK to inform these decisions of what to grow, when to grow and how much to irrigate."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p9,NO_TITLE,"Given the predominance of market economies worldwide, most farmers also depend on the market to sell their produce, and market fluctuations affect their incomes. In addition, market-related volatility coupled with climate change is a source of increased risk for farmers. Several economic and financial instruments are being used with varying levels of success to offset some of these interlinked impacts. Index-based crop insurance is one such instrument that compensates farmers for losing crops due to hazards such as floods and droughts. However, several limitations in their implementation remain."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.4_p11,NO_TITLE,"In cases of severe droughts and floods, which have debilitating impacts on already poor and vulnerable populations, national governments provide social safety programmes, such as food or cash-for-work programmes, which are shown to be successful in reducing risks for the most vulnerable people, even though there are often concerns with targeting efficiency. Providing training and capacity building of farmers to adopt new farming practices and technologies to manage risk better are also known to be effective when the training is conceptualised, targeted and implemented in consultation with farmers. Planned adaptation practices include managing weather and market risks through insurance products, social safety nets for vulnerable populations, and providing the right mix of training and capacity building. These adaptation practices are generally implemented by civil society, governments and the private sector."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"For decades, communities worldwide have already been adapting to climate change-induced hydrological changes to maintain their livelihood and safety. Adaptation is a multi-faceted process that is implemented differently depending on the sector affected by changes in the hydrological cycle and the region where these changes happen. For instance, farmers in the semiarid areas might adapt to changing rain patterns through irrigation (see also FAQ4.4). At the same time, urban dwellers can adopt measures such as rainwater harvesting and other nature-based solutions. Several principles have been documented as crucial for achieving sustainable adaptation as they support communities in becoming more resilient to climate change. However, these principles can be implemented singularly or in tandem, and it is essential to acknowledge that long-term adaptation success is context-specific. Therefore, it is critical to involve local communities in co-designing effective adaptation responses."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"For communities to sustainably adapt to climate impacts on water security, participation, cooperation and bottom-up engagement are critical in all stages of the decision-making processes, from planning to full implementation. Many of the countries and social groups most threatened by climate change have contributed least to global warming and do not have access to adequate resources to adapt. Effective participation of these actors in water-related climate change adaptation planning can contribute to more equitable adaptation actions. The involvement of the most vulnerable in the design of adaptation responses makes it more probable that these solutions will suit their needs and have therefore a higher chance of being effective. Accessible, inclusive and well-coordinated efforts to enhance water security will improve the legitimacy of water governance and work synergistically with reducing inequalities (UN SDG, SDG 10) and encouraging more sustainable communities (SDG 11). Communities can also be involved in sector-specific adaptation responses. These are often water-related and help ensure that climate action (SDG 13) is well aligned with clean water and sanitation (SGD 6)."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"The participation of traditionally excluded groups such as women and marginalised communities and Indigenous Peoples and ethnic minorities contributes to more equitable and socially just adaptation actions. Water insecurity disproportionately affects these marginalised groups, and their participation in water governance and implementation can help alleviate this burden."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"Recognising the importance of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in improving water security is vital to ensuring that decisions and solutions align with the interests of Indigenous Peoples and local peoples and benefit their communities culturally and economically. Furthermore, the effectiveness of adaptation measures and strategies improves when Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge are combined and integrated with technical understandings of climate change."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"The climate adaptation plans led by national governments and local authorities will only be accepted and adequately implemented when supported by the community. Therefore, strong political and societal support is necessary to ensure effective policy changes, whether local or national. Significantly, access to financial assistance from private and public sources expands the range of strategies that communities can consider for enhancing their water security."
wg2_ch04_FAQ 4.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"These principles are also conducive to the achievement of the United Nations SDGs. Actions that reduce climate risk and enhance water security can positively interact with sustainable development objectives (synergies).
