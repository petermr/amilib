wg2_ch02_2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"We provide assessments of observed and projected impacts of climate change across species, biomes (vegetation types), ecosystems and ecosystem services, highlighting the processes that are emerging on a global scale. Where sufficient evidence exists, differences in biological responses across regions, taxonomic groups or types of ecosystems are presented, particularly when such differences provide meaningful insights into current or potential future autonomous or human-mediated adaptations. Human interventions that might build the resilience of ecosystems and minimise the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are assessed. Such interventions include adaptation strategies and programmes to support biodiversity conservation and Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). The assessments were done in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and sustainable development goals (SDGs), whose contributions to climate resilient development (CRD) pathways are assessed. This chapter highlights both the successes and failures of adaptation attempts and considers potential synergies and conflicts with land-based  climate change mitigation. Knowledge gaps and sources of uncertainty are included to encourage additional research."
wg2_ch02_2.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The Working Group II Summary for Policymakers of the AR5 stated that ‘many terrestrial and freshwater species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances, and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change’ (IPCC, 2014d). Based on long-term observed changes across the regions, it was estimated that approximately 20–30% of plant and animal species are at risk of extinction when global mean temperatures rise 2–3°C above pre-industrial levels (Fischlin et al., 2007). In addition, the WGII AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014e) broadly suggested that autonomous adaptation by ecosystems and wild species might occur, and proposed human-assisted adaptations to minimise negative climate change impacts."
wg2_ch02_2.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Risk assessments for species, communities, key ecosystems and their services were based on the risk assessment framework introduced in the IPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014b). Assessments of observed changes in biological systems emphasise detecting and attributing the impacts of climate change on ecological and evolutionary processes, particularly freshwater ecosystems, and ecosystem processes such as wildfires, that were superficially assessed in previous reports. Where appropriate, assessment of interactions between climate change and other human activities is provided."
wg2_ch02_2.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Land use and land cover change (LULCC) as well as the unsustainable exploitation of resources in terrestrial and freshwater systems continue to be major factors contributing to the loss of natural ecosystems and biodiversity (high confidence). Fertiliser input, pollution of waterways, dam construction and the extraction of freshwater for irrigation put additional pressure on biodiversity and alter ecosystem function (Shin et al., 2019). Likewise, for biodiversity, invasive alien species have been identified as a major threat, especially in freshwater systems, on islands and in coastal regions (high confidence) (IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018e; IPBES, 2018c; IPBES, 2018d; IPBES, 2019). Climate change and CO2 are expected to become increasingly important as drivers of change over the coming decades (Ciais et al., 2013; Settele et al., 2014; IPBES, 2019; IPCC, 2019c)."
wg2_ch02_2.1.2 _p1,NO_TITLE,"Species diversity and ecosystem function influence each other reciprocally, while the latter forms the necessary basis for ecosystem services (Hooper et al., 2012; Mokany et al., 2016). Drivers of impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem services have been assessed in reports by the IPCC, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Global Environmental Outlook (Settele et al., 2014; FAO, 2018; IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018e; IPBES, 2018c; IPBES, 2018d; IPBES, 2019; UNEP, 2019; Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). Most recently, the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) provided an assessment on land degradation and desertification, GHG emissions and food security in the context of global warming (IPCC, 2019c), and the IPBES–IPCC joint report on biodiversity and climate change provided a synthesis of the current understanding of the interactions, synergies and feedbacks between biodiversity and climate change (Pörtner et al., 2021). This chapter builds on and expands the results of these assessments."
wg2_ch02_2.1.2 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Assessment of the impacts of climate change on freshwater systems has been limited in previous assessments, and inter-linkages between terrestrial and freshwater processes have not been fully explored (Settele et al., 2014; IPBES, 2019). Improved treatment of impacts on terrestrial and freshwater systems is critical, considering the revisions of international sustainability goals and targets, especially the conclusion that many of the proposed post-2020 targets of the CBD cannot be met due to climate change impacts (Arneth et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.1.2 _p3,NO_TITLE,"Previous reports highlighted the possibility of new ecosystem states stemming from shifts in thermal regimes, species composition, and energy and matter flows (Settele et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2019). Projecting such “tipping points” (see Glossary Appendix II) has been identified in previous reports as a challenge since monitoring programmes, field studies, and ecosystem and biodiversity modelling tools do not capture the underlying species–species and species–climate interactions sufficiently well to identify how biological interactions within and across trophic levels may amplify or dampen shifts in ecosystem states (Settele et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2019). Building on these previous analyses and the recent literature, Chapter 2 of AR6 provides new insights compared to those of previous assessments by (i) emphasising freshwater aspects and the interlinkages between freshwater and terrestrial systems, (ii) assessing more clearly the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, (iii) assessing the impacts associated with climate change mitigation scenarios versus those of climate change including interactions with adaptation, and (iv) where possible, places findings in the context of the United Nations (UN) SDGs 2030 and services for human societies."
wg2_ch02_2.1.3 _p1,NO_TITLE,"For biological systems, we use the framework for detection and attribution outlined in AR5, in which biological changes observed are not attributed to global but rather to local or regional climate changes (Parmesan et al., 2013; Cramer et al., 2014). However, global distribution of regional responses is desirable to achieve generality, and data in prior reports were concentrated from the Northern Hemisphere. The critique of ‘global’ studies by (Feeley et al., 2017) argues that their naming is misleading, that most of them are far from global, and that a considerable geographic and taxonomic bias remains. This bias is diminishing, as regional data from the Southern Hemisphere is added and there is now representation from every continent."
wg2_ch02_2.1.3 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Overall confidence in attributing biological changes to climate change can be increased in multiple ways (Parmesan et al., 2013), four of which we list here. First, confidence rises when the time span of biological records is long, such that decadal trends in climate can be compared with decadal trends in biological response, and long-term trends can be statistically distinguished from natural variability. Second, confidence can be increased by examining a large geographic area, which tends to diminish the effects of local confounding factors (Parmesan et al., 2013; Daskalova et al., 2021). Third, confidence is increased when there is experimental or empirical evidence of a mechanistic link between particular climate metrics and a biological response. Fourth, confidence is increased when particular fingerprints of climate change are documented that uniquely implicate climate change as the causal driver of the biological change (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003). These conditions constitute multiple lines of evidence, which, when they converge, can provide very high confidence that climate change is the causal driver of an observed change in a particular biological species or system (Parmesan et al., 2013)."
wg2_ch02_2.1.3 _p3,NO_TITLE,"Important factors that may confound or obscure effects of climate change are the presence of invasive species, changes in land use (LULCC) and, in freshwater systems, eutrophication (IPCC, 2019a). The temporal and spatial scale of studies also affects estimates of impacts. The most extreme published estimates of biological change tend to be derived from smaller areas and/or shorter time frames (Daskalova et al., 2021); a recent large global analysis of data for 12,415 species found that differences in study methodology accounted for most of the explained variance in reported range shifts (Lenoir et al., 2020). The importance of LULCC is frequently stressed, but there is a paucity of studies actually quantifying the relative effects of climate change and LULCC on species and communities. (Sirami et al., 2017) found only 13 such studies: four concluded that effects of LULCC overrode those of climate change, four found that the two drivers independently affected different species and five found that they acted in synergy."
wg2_ch02_2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Ecosystems provide services essential for human survival and well-being. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment defined ecosystem services as ‘the benefits people obtain from ecosystems’ including ‘provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services such as regulation of floods, drought, land degradation, and disease; supporting services such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and cultural services such as recreational, spiritual, religious, and other nonmaterial benefits’ (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005)."
wg2_ch02_2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The IPBES renamed the concept ‘nature’s contributions to people’ and broadened the definition to ‘the contributions, both positive and negative, of living nature (i.e., diversity of organisms, ecosystems, and their associated ecological and evolutionary processes) to the quality of life for people. Beneficial contributions from nature include such things as food provision, water purification, flood control, and artistic inspiration, whereas detrimental contributions include disease transmission and predation that damages people or their assets’ (IPBES, 2019). The concept was modified to include more social viewpoints and broaden the analyses beyond narrow economic stock-and-flow valuation approaches (Díaz et al., 2018). IPBES developed a classification of 18 categories of ecosystem services (see Table 2.1)."
wg2_ch02_2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"When anthropogenic climate change affects ecosystems, it can also affect ecosystem services for people. Climate change connects to ecosystem services by means of three links, i.e., climate change–species–ecosystems–ecosystem services. This chapter assesses these connections via all three links when end-to-end published scientific analyses are available for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. This type of robust evidence exists for some key ecosystem services (Section 2.5.3, 2.5.4), and is assessed in specific report sections: biodiversity habitat creation and maintenance (Sections 2.4, 2.5), regulation of detrimental organisms and biological processes (Sections 2.4.2.3, 2.4.2.7, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6.4, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in this chapter), regulation of climate through ecosystem feedbacks in terms of carbon storage (Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.2.10, 2.5.3.4, 2.5.3.5) and albedo (Section 2.5.3.5) and the provision of freshwater from ecosystems to people (Section 2.5.3.6)."
wg2_ch02_2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"For ecosystem services that do not have published scientific information to establish unambiguous links to climate change, the climate–species–ecosystem links are assessed. Global ecological assessments, including the Global Biodiversity Assessment (Heywood et al., 1995), the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005), and the IPBES Global Assessment Report (IPBES, 2019) have synthesised scientific information on the ecosystem–ecosystem services link, but a full assessment from climate change to ecosystem services is often impeded by limited quantitative studies that span this entire spectrum (see Mengist et al., 2020) for a review of this gap in montane regions)."
wg2_ch02_2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"IPCC and IPBES are collaborating to address gaps in the knowledge about the effects of climate change on ecosystem services (Pörtner et al., 2021). Table 2.1 provides a guide for finding information on climate change and individual ecosystem services in the AR6."

The order of services in the table follows the order presented by IPBES and does not denote importance or priority. Connections denote observed impacts, future risks and adaptation. The order of connections follows the relevance or the order of sections. Numbers in parentheses refer to sections in this chapter."
wg2_ch02_2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"In AR6, Working Group I (IPCC, 2021a) describes changes in physical climate systems using the term ‘climatic impact-drivers’ (CIDs), which can have detrimental, beneficial or neutral effects on a system. In contrast, the literature on natural systems tends to focus on hazards, which include natural or human-induced physical events, impacts, or trends with the potential to cause negative effects on ecosystems and environmental resources. Hazards are affected by current and future changes in climate, including altered climate variability and extreme events (Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Hazards can occur suddenly (e.g., a heat wave or heavy rain event), or more slowly (e.g., land loss, degradation and erosion linked to multiple climate hazards compounding). Observed exposure and risks to protected areas are assessed in Section 2.5.3.1.1. See also Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in this chapter."
wg2_ch02_2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Non-climatic hazards such as LUC, habitat fragmentation, pollution and invasive species have been the primary drivers of change in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the past (high confidence) (Figure 2.1). These impacts have been extensively documented in reports by the IPBES (2021). However, while climate change has not been the predominant influence to date, its relative impact is increasing (IPCC SRCCL), with greater interactive effects of non-climate and climate hazards now occurring (Birk et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The major climate hazards at the global level are generally well understood (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) (WGI AR6 Interactive Atlas). Increased temperatures and changes to rainfall and runoff patterns; greater variability in temperature, rainfall, river flow and water levels; and rising sea levels and the increased frequency of extreme events means that greater areas of the world are being exposed to climate hazards outside of those to which they are adapted (high confidence) (Lange et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Extreme events are a natural and important part of many ecosystems, and many organisms have adapted to cope with long-term and short-term climate variability within the disturbance regime experienced during their evolutionary history (high confidence). However, climate changes, disturbance regime changes and the magnitude and frequency of extreme events such as floods, droughts, cyclones, heat waves and fire have increased in many regions (high confidence). These disturbances affect ecosystem functioning, biodiversity and ecosystem services (high confidence), but are, in general, poorly captured in impact models (Albrich et al., 2020b), although this should improve as higher-resolution climate models that better capture smaller-scale processes and extreme events become available (Seneviratne et al., 2021). Extreme events pose huge challenges for EbA (IPCC, 2012). Ecosystem functionality, on which such adaptation measures rely, may be altered or destroyed by extreme episodic events (Handmer et al., 2012; Lal et al., 2012; Pol et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is high confidence that the combination of internal variability, superimposed on longer-term climate trends, is pushing ecosystems to tipping points, beyond which abrupt and possibly irreversible changes are occurring (Harris et al., 2018a; Jones et al., 2018; Hoffmann et al., 2019b; Prober et al., 2019; Berdugo et al., 2020; Bergstrom et al., 2021). Increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves, droughts and aridity, floods, fires and extreme storms have been observed in many regions (Seneviratne et al., 2012; Ummenhofer and Meehl, 2017), and these trends are projected to continue (high confidence) (Section 3.2.2.1, Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES this Chapter) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"While the major climate hazards at the global level are generally well described with high confidence, there is less understanding about the importance of hazards on ecosystems when they are superimposed (Allen et al., 2010; Anderegg et al., 2015; Seidl et al., 2017; Dean et al., 2018), and the outcomes are difficult to quantify in future projections (Handmer et al., 2012). Simultaneous or sequential events (coincident or compounding events) can lead to an extreme event or impact, even if each event is not in themselves extreme (Denny et al., 2009; Hinojosa et al., 2019). For example, the compounding effects of SLR, extreme coastal high tide, storm surge, and river flow can substantially increase flooding hazard and impacts on freshwater systems (Moftakhari et al., 2017). On land, changing rainfall patterns and repeated heat waves may interact with biological factors such as altered plant growth and nutrient allocation under elevated CO2, affecting herbivore rates and insect outbreaks leading to the widespread dieback of some forests (e.g., in Australian eucalypt forests) (Gherlenda et al., 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2019a). Risk assessments typically only consider a single climate hazard with no changing variability, thereby potentially underestimating the actual risk (Milly et al., 2008; Sadegh et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018; Terzi et al., 2019; Stockwell et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Understanding impacts associated with the rapid rate of climate change is less developed and more uncertain than changes in mean climate. High climate velocity (Loarie et al., 2009) is expected to be associated with distribution shifts, incomplete range filling and species extinctions (high confidence) (Sandel et al., 2011; Burrows et al., 2014), although not all species are equally at risk from high velocity (see Sections 2.4.2.2, 2.5.1.3). It is generally assumed that the more rapid the rate of change, the greater the impact on species and ecosystems, but responses are taxonomically and geographically variable (high confidence) (Kling et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"For example, strong dispersers are less at risk, while species with low dispersal ability, small ranges and long lifespans (e.g., many plants, especially trees, many amphibians and some small mammals) are more at risk (IPCC, 2014b; Hamann et al., 2015) . This is likely to favour generalist and invasive species, altering species composition, ecosystem structure and function (Clavel et al., 2011; Büchi and Vuilleumier, 2014). The ability to track suitable climates is substantially reduced by habitat fragmentation and human modifications of the landscape such as dams on rivers and urbanisation (high confidence). Freshwater systems are particularly at risk of rapid warming, given their naturally fragmented distribution. Velocity of changes in surface temperature of inland standing waters globally was estimated as being 3.5 ± 2.3 km per decade from 1861 to 2005. From 2006 to 2099, this is projected to increase from 8.7 ± 5.5 km (representative concentration pathway, RCP2.6) to 57.0 ± 17.0 km (RCP8.5) per decade (Woolway and Maberly, 2020). Although the dispersal of the aerial adult stage of some aquatic insects can surpass these climate velocities, rates of change under mid- and high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) are substantially higher than the known rates of the active dispersal of many species (Woolway and Maberly, 2020). Many species, both terrestrial and freshwater, are not expected to be able to disperse fast enough to track suitable climates under mid- and high-emission scenarios (medium confidence) (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5; (Brito-Morales et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.2 _p1,NO_TITLE,"Understanding of the large-scale drivers and the local-to-regional feedback processes that lead to extreme events is still limited, and projections of extremes and coincident or compounding events remain uncertain (Prudhomme et al., 2014; Sillmann et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2018; Miralles et al., 2019). Extreme events are challenging to model because they are, by definition, rare, and often occur at spatial and temporal scales much finer than the resolution of climate models (Sillmann et al., 2017; Zscheischler et al., 2018). Additionally, the processes that cause extreme events often interact, as is the case for drought and heat events, and they are spatially and temporally dependent, for example, soil moisture and temperature (Vogel et al., 2017). Understanding feedbacks between land and atmosphere also remains limited. For example, positive feedbacks between soil and vegetation, or between evaporation, radiation and precipitation, are important in the preconditioning of extreme events such as heat waves and droughts, and can increase the severity and impact of such events (Miralles et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.2 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Despite recent improvements in observational studies and climate modelling (Santanello et al., 2015; Stegehuis et al., 2015; PaiMazumder and Done, 2016; Basara and Christian, 2018; Knelman et al., 2019), the potential to quantify or infer formal causal relationships between multiple drivers and/or hazards remains limited (Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Kleinman et al., 2019; Miralles et al., 2019; Yokohata et al., 2019; Harris et al., 2020). The mechanisms underlying the response are difficult to identify (e.g., responses to heat stress, drought and insects), effects vary among species and at different life stages, and an initial stress may influence the response to further stress (Nolet and Kneeshaw, 2018). Additionally, hazards such as drought are often exacerbated by societal, industrial and agricultural water demands, requiring more sophisticated modelling of the physical and human systems (Mehran et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2017). Observations of past compound events may not provide reliable guides as to how future events may evolve, because human activity and recent climate change continue to interact to influence both system functioning and a climate state not previously experienced (Seneviratne et al., 2021)"

The climate hazards specific to freshwater systems not documented elsewhere in AR6 are summarised here."
wg2_ch02_2.3.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, evidence of changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers has continued to increase. Global warming rates for lake surface waters were estimated as 0.21°C–0.45°C per decade between 1970 and 2010, exceeding sea-surface temperature (SST) trends of 0.09°C per decade between 1980 and 2017 (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Figure 2.2; (Schneider and Hook, 2010; Kraemer et al., 2015; O’Reilly et al., 2015; Woolway et al., 2020b). Warming of lake surface water temperatures was variable within regions (O’Reilly et al., 2015) but more homogeneous than deep-water temperature changes (Pilla et al., 2020). Because temperature trends in lakes can vary vertically, horizontally and seasonally, complex changes have occurred in the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms at particular depths and temperatures (Kraemer et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Changes in river water temperatures ranged from −1.21°C to +1.076°C per decade between 1901 and 2010 (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Hari et al., 2006; Kaushal et al., 2010; Jurgelėnaitė et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Latkovska and Apsīte, 2016; Marszelewski and Pius, 2016). The more rapid increase in surface water temperature in lakes and rivers in regions with cold winters (O’Reilly et al., 2015) can, in part, be attributed to the amplified warming in polar and high-latitude regions (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Screen and Simmonds, 2010; Stuecker et al., 2018)."

This results from greater warming of surface temperatures relative to deep-water temperatures, and the loss of ice during winter which prevents inverse thermal stratification in north temperate lakes (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Adrian et al., 2009; Winslow et al., 2015; Adrian et al., 2016; Schwefel et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2017). "
wg2_ch02_2.3.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Oxygen availability: increased water temperature and reduced mixing cause a decrease in dissolved oxygen. In 400 lakes, dissolved oxygen in surface and deep waters declined by 4.1 and 16.8%, respectively, between 1980 and 2017 (Jane et al., 2021). The deepest water layers are expected to experience an increase in hypoxic conditions by >25% due to fewer complete mixing events, with strong repercussions for nutrient dynamics and the loss of thermal habitat (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Straile et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015; Schwefel et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch02_2.3.3.2 _p1,NO_TITLE,"Depending on how the intensification of the global water cycle affects individual lake water budgets, the amount of water stored in specific lakes may increase, decrease or have no substantial cumulative effect (Notaro et al., 2015; Pekel et al., 2016; Rodell et al., 2018; Busker et al., 2019; Woolway et al., 2020b). The magnitude of hydrological changes that can be assuredly attributed to climate change remains uncertain (Hegerl et al., 2015; Gronewold and Rood, 2019; Kraemer et al., 2020). Attribution of water storage variation in lakes due to climate change is facilitated when such variations occur coherently across broad geographic regions and long time scales, preferably absent of other anthropogenic hydrological influences (Watras et al., 2014; Kraemer et al., 2020). There is increasing awareness that climate change contributes to the loss of small temporary ponds which cover a greater global area than lakes (Bagella et al., 2016)."

High confidence in attribution of these trends to climate change is supported by long-term ground survey data and observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (Ma et al., 2010; Rodell et al., 2018; Kraemer et al., 2020)."

More than half of global rivers undergo periodic drying that reduces river connectivity (medium evidence, medium agreement ). Increased frequency and intensity of droughts may cause perennial rivers to become intermittent and intermittent rivers to disappear (medium evidence, medium agreement ), threatening freshwater fish in habitats already characterised by heat and droughts (Datry et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2017; Jaric et al., 2019). In high-altitude/latitude streams, reduced glacier and snowpack extent, earlier snowmelt and altered precipitation patterns, attributed to climate change, have increased flow intermittency (Siebers et al., 2019; Gudmundsson et al., 2021). Patterns in flow regimes can be directly linked to a variety of processes shaping freshwater biodiversity, so any climate change-induced changes in flow regimes and river connectivity are expected to alter species composition as well as having societal impacts (See Chapter 3 in (IPCC, 2018b)) (Bunn and Arthington, 2002; Thomson et al., 2012; Chessman, 2015; Kakouei et al., 2018)."

The global extent of river ice declined by 25% between 1984 and 2018 (Yang et al., 2020). This trend has been more pronounced at higher latitudes, consistent with enhanced polar warming (large geographic coverage) (Du et al., 2017). Empirical long-term and remote-sensing data gathered in an increasingly large number of freshwater systems supports very high confidence in attributing these trends to climate change.

Milder winters and warmer growing seasons were likewise implicated in poleward expansions and increasing outbreaks of several forest pests (Weed et al., 2013), leading to the current prediction that 41% of major insect pest species will further increase their damage as climate warms, and only 4% will reduce their impacts, while the rest will show mixed responses (Lehmann et al., 2020)."

We might therefore expect tree mortality from insect outbreaks to be most severe at sites climatically less suitable for the plants, where plants would be under more stress. However, (Jaime et al., 2019), using separate species distribution models (SDMs) (MaxEnt) for the insects and plants, found that observed mortality of Scots pine from bark beetles was highest at sites that were most climatically suitable for the trees as well as for the insects.

A global meta-analysis of 236 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates and plants across 132 independent studies found that changes in population abundances were strongly related to temperature variability globally, and significantly related to precipiation variability in lower latitudes (Pearce-Higgins et al., 2015). In a global study of 538 diverse plant and animal species, sites with local extinctions were associated with smaller changes of mean annual temperature but larger and faster changes of hottest yearly temperatures than sites where populations persisted (Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020). Near warm range limits, 44% of species had suffered local extinctions. In both temperate and tropical regions, sites with local extinction had greater increases in maximum temperatures than those without: a Tmax increase of 0.456°C and 0.316°C versus a Tmean increase of 0.153°C and 0.061°C for temperate (n= 505 sites) and tropical (n= 76 sites), respectively (P < 0.001) (Román-Palacios and Wiens, 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Wiens (2016) assumed that population extinctions were primarily driven by climate change when they occurred at elevational or latitudinal ‘warm edge’ range limits, and were at relatively undisturbed sites stated by the authors to be under increasing climatic stress. By this criterion, climate-caused local extinctions were widespread among plants and animals globally, detected in 47% of 976 species examined. The percentage of species suffering these extinctions was higher in the Tropics (55%) than in temperate habitats (39%), higher in freshwater (74%) than in marine (51%) or terrestrial (46%) habitats, and higher in animals (50%) than in plants (39%). The difference between plants and animals varied with latitude; in the temperate zone, a much higher proportion of animals than plants suffered range-limit extinctions (38.6% of 207 animal species vs. 8.6% of 105 plants, P < 0.0001) while at tropical sites, local extinction rates were (nonsignificantly) higher in plants (59% of 155 species) than in animals (52% of 349 species), the reverse of their temperate-zone relationship.

wg2_ch02_2.4.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Freshwater population extinctions are mainly due to habitat loss, the introduction of alien species, pollution, over-harvesting (Gozlan et al., 2019; IPBES, 2019) and climate change-induced epidemic diseases (Pounds et al., 2006)(see Section 2.4.2.7.1). Climate warming, particularly through the intensification and severity of droughts, contributes to the disappearance of small ponds which hold rare and endemic species (Bagella et al., 2016). Systematic data on the extent and biology of small ponds is, however, lacking on the global scale. Extreme heat waves can lead to large local fish kills in lakes (see Section 2.3.3.5), when water temperature and oxygen concentrations surpass critical thresholds and threatening cold-water fish and amphibians (Thompson et al., 2012). Evidence of a local extinction of some invertebrate species with a 1.4°C–1.7°C rise in mean annual stream winter temperature from 1981 to 2005 was reported in Abrahams et al. (2013). Population declines of specialist species in glacier-fed streams, such as the non-biting midge Diamesa davisi (Chironomidae), can be attributed to climate-change-driven glacier retreat (Cauvy-Fraunié and Dangles, 2019), and the flatworm Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) has been reported as locally extinct in the Welsh Llyn Brianne river (Durance and Ormerod, 2010; Larsen et al., 2018)."

Major declines have been recorded for several species, population extinctions have occured at lower elevations since the early 2000s, and the white sub-species of the lemuroid ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides) in Queensland, Australia, disappeared after heat waves in 2005 (high confidence): intensive censuses found only 2 individuals in 2009 (Chandler, 2014; Weber et al., 2021)."

The island was unihabited with few non-climatic threats, providing high confidence in the attribution of extinction of the BC melomys to climate change-driven increases in the frequency and duration of island inundation (Turner and Batianoff, 2007; Woinarski et al., 2014; Gynther et al., 2016; Watson, 2016; Woinarski et al., 2017)."

wg2_ch02_2.4.2.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The most common type of community change takes the form of in situ decreases in cold-adapted species and increases in warm-adapted species (Bowler et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018; Kuhn and Gégout, 2019; Feeley et al., 2020). This process has lead to increases of species richness on mountaintops and decreased richness at adjacent lower elevations (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Forister et al., 2010; Steinbauer et al., 2018). While it is also expected from observed range shifts of individual species that species richness should increase along tropical/temperate ecotones and along temperate/boreal ecotones, to date this has not been well documented. Lewthwaite et al (Lewthwaite and Mooers, 2022) documented a small increase in local richness across Canada for 265 species of butterflies, but the stronger effect was an homogenization across the region, with generalist species generally expanding into new sites and leading to lower Beta-diversity (lower diversity among sites). In a study of 66 bumble bee species across North America and Europe, Soroye et al (Soroye et al., 2020) did not find the expected pattern, with most sites, regardless of latitude, declining in species richness, even when individual species benefited from warming or increased precipitation at some sites. Observed shifts in community composition have consequences for species’ interactions. Such indirect effects of climate change have been shown to often have greater impacts on species than the direct effects of climate itself, particularly for higher-level consumers (Cahill et al., 2013; Ockendon et al., 2014)."

Examples of climate debt, measured from community composition changes, come from birds and butterflies in Europe (Devictor et al., 2012) and lowland forest herbaceous plants in France (Bertrand et al., 2011). The French study found that larger debts occurred in communities with warmer baseline conditions and that some of the apparent debt stemmed from the ability of species to tolerate warming in situ, so no range shift was observed."

A study of 14 such habitats reported simplified food web structures and shortened pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources (high confidence) (O’Gorman et al., 2019). Changes in the relative abundance of species, species composition and biodiversity due to warming trends, and non-climate-driven changes are to be expected in lakes and rivers globally. However, thus far, empirical evidence and mechanistic understanding to inform modelling is too limited to draw general conclusions about the nature of current and future climate change-driven changes within entire food webs on a global scale (Urban et al., 2016)."

Declines in the abundance of cold-stenothermal species, particularly the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), coregonids  and smelt, and increases in eurythermal fish (e.g., the thermo-tolerant carp Cyprinus carpio, common bream, pike perch, roach and shad) have been observed in northern temperate lakes associated with warming trends (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Jeppesen et al., 2012; Jeppesen et al., 2014). These changes increase predation pressure on zooplankton and reduce grazing pressure on phytoplankton, which may result in higher phytoplankton biomass (De Senerpont Domis et al., 2013; Jeppesen et al., 2014; Adrian et al., 2016). Reduction in lake mixing lowers the concentration of nutrients in the epilimnion and may lead to higher silicon-to-phosphorous ratios that negatively affect diatom growth (Yankova et al., 2017) or overall primary productivity (see Section 2.4.4.5.2)."

In glacier-fed streams globally, climate change has caused community turnover and changes in abundances in terms of increased generalist and decreased specialist species (Lencioni, 2018; Cauvy-Fraunié and Dangles, 2019). In turn, dragonflies in flowing waters, monitored during the warming period from 1988 through 2006 in Europe, did not show consistent changes in their distribution (Grewe et al., 2013), reviewed in Knouft and Ficklin (2017). Long-term trends in the species composition and community structure of stream macro-invertebrates, specifically a general trend for decreases in species characteristic of cold, fast-flowing waters and increases of thermophilic species typical of stagnant or slow-moving waters, have been attributed to climate change (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Daufresne et al., 2007; Chessman, 2015). A study of 14 geothermal streams reported simplified food web structures and shortened pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources (O’Gorman et al., 2019). Macrophytes benefit from rising water temperatures, but increased shading from increased phytoplankton biomass could offset this (Hossain et al., 2016; Short et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017a)."

Modelling predicts that the effects of climate warming on food web structure and stability favour the success of invading species (Sentis et al., 2021). Both simulated warming experiments (Zettlemoyer et al., 2019) and long-term observations (Willis et al., 2010) have found phenologies of exotic species to respond more adaptively to warming than those of natives; in the long-term observations, the success of exotics was attributed to their greater phenological responsiveness. In an expert assessment of the future relative importance of different drivers of the impacts of biological invasions, climate change was named as the most important driver in polar regions, second-most important in temperate regions (after trade/transport), and third-most important in the tropics (after trade/transport and human demography/migration) (Essl et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.2.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"However, not all exotic species become invasive. As novel climate conditions develop, novel communities made up of new combinations of species are emerging as populations and species adapt and shift their ranges differentially, not always with negative consequences (high confidence) (Dornelas et al., 2014; Evers et al., 2018; Teixeira and Fernandes, 2020). Novel communities differ in composition, structure, function and evolutionary trajectories, as the proportions of specialists and generalists, native, introduced and range-shifting species change and species interactions are altered, ultimately affecting ecosystem dynamics and functioning (Lurgi et al., 2012; Hobbs et al., 2014; Heger and van Andel, 2019). The exact nature of novel communities is difficult to predict because species-level uncertainties propagate at the community level due to ecological interactions (Williams and Jackson, 2007). However, observations, experimental mesocosms (Bastazini et al., 2021), and theoretical models (Lurgi et al., 2012; Sentis et al., 2021) provide support that novel communities will continue to emerge with climate change  (medium confidence)."

In the Tropics, by contrast, changes in precipitation have more strongly influenced animal phenology than have temperature changes (Cohen et al., 2018). A meta-analysis compared observed phenological advances in birds with expectations due to warming local climates, and concluded that the observed advances fell short of what was expected and that a substantial phenological climate debt had been generated (Radchuk et al., 2019)."

For example, seabirds continue to breed with their pre-climate-change phenologies (Keogan et al., 2018). Newer reviews and analyses reveal differences in responses across continents and time intervals (Piao et al., 2019). Mean advance in days per decade for plants was 5.5 in China and 3.0–4.2 in Europe, but only 0.9 in North America (Piao et al., 2019). Mean values for the retardation of autumn leaf fall, which can be more influenced by photoperiod and less by temperature than spring leaf-out, were 0.36 days per decade in Europe (Menzel et al., 2020), 2.6 days per decade in China and around 3 days per decade in the USA (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Piao et al., 2019)."

Annual crops, the timing of which is determined by farmers, were an exception. When natural systems were advancing fast prior to 1998, farmers advanced more slowly, but during the natural ‘hiatus’, farmed crops advanced faster than wild plants and cultivated trees (Menzel et al., 2020). In a long (67 years) European time series (Menzel et al., 2020), autumn leaf colouring showed delays attributed to winter and spring warming in 57% of observations (mean delay of 0.36 days per decade); spring and summer phenologies advanced in 89% of wild plants, despite decreased winter chilling, with around 60% of trends significant and ‘strongly attributable’ to winter and spring warming; and the growing season lengthened in 84% of cases (mean lengthening 0.26 days yr -1) (Table 2.2)."

For each study for which data were made available, a response for an individual species or functional group was classified as (1) no response (i.e., no significant change in the measured trait over time), (2) if a significant change was found, the response was classified as either consistent or not consistent with expectations according to local or regional climate trends. Percentages are approximate and estimated for the studies as a whole. Individual analyses within the studies may differ. The specific metrics of climate change analysed for associations with biological change vary somewhat across studies, but most use changes in local or regional temperatures (e.g., mean monthly T or mean annual T), with some using precipitation metrics (e.g., total annual rainfall). For example, a consistent response would be poleward range shifts in areas that are warming. Probability (P) of getting the observed ratio of consistent-to-not consistent responses by chance was <10–13 for (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003; Root et al., 2003; Root et al., 2005; Poloczanska et al., 2013) and <0.001 for Rosenzweig et al.

Phenological changes in lakes have been related to rising water temperatures, reduced ice cover and prolonged thermal stratification (increasing evidence and agreement since AR5; very high confidence). Crozier and Hutchings (2014) reviewed the phenological changes in fish and documented that changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature.

For example, in northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the spring flowering of some plants was delayed instead of being advanced as to be expected with warming (Cook et al., 2012a; Cook et al., 2012b; Legave et al., 2015). These turned out to be species requiring vernalisation (winter chilling) to speed their development in spring (Ettinger et al., 2020). For these plants, phenological changes result from the combined effects of advancement caused by spring warming and retardation caused by winter warming. Incorporating this level of complexity into analyses revealed that a greater proportion of species was responding to climate change than estimated according to the simple expectation that warming would always cause advancement (92% responding versus 72% from earlier analyses) (Cook et al., 2012b)."

Plasticity in heat tolerance (e.g., due to reversible acclimation or acclimatisation) can also potentially compensate for rising temperatures (Angilletta Jr, 2009), but ectotherms have relatively low acclimation in thermal tolerance and acclimation is expected to only slightly reduce the risk of overheating in even the most plastic taxa (low confidence) (Gunderson and Stillman, 2015)."

Decreased body size in warmer climates (as higher surface area-to-volume ratios maximise heat loss) is expected, based on biogeographic patterns such as Bergmann’s rule, but both increases and decreases have been documented in mammals, birds, lizards and invertebrates and were attributed to climate change (Teplitsky and Millien, 2014; Gotanda et al., 2015; Gardner et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2021). Contrasting patterns (increased body size) may be due to short-term modifications in selection pressures (e.g., changes to predation and competition), variation in life histories or as a result of interactions with climate variables other than temperature (e.g., changes to food availability along with rainfall changes) and other disturbances (Yom-Tov and Yom-Tov, 2004; Gardner et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2019) or use of different body size measurements (linear vs. volumetric dimensions) (Salewski et al., 2014)."

Such changes may represent decreased phenotypic diversity and, potentially, genetic diversity (low confidence), but the consequences of climate change for the genetic structure and diversity of populations have not been widely assessed (Pauls et al., 2013). Simplistically, the thermal melanism hypothesis suggests that lighter (higher-reflectance) individuals should be fitter and therefore be selected for in a warmer climate (Clusella-Trullas et al., 2007). However, several biotic (e.g., thermoregulatory requirements, predator avoidance and signalling) and abiotic (e.g., UV, moisture and inter-annual variability) factors interact to influence changes in colour, making attribution to climate change across species and broad geographic regions difficult (Kingsolver and Buckley, 2015; Stuart-Fox et al., 2017; Clusella-Trullas and Nielsen, 2020)."

If advancing spring phenology results in earlier breeding, this may offset the effect of rising temperatures in the breeding range and reduce the effect of increasing temperature on body size (Zimova et al., 2021). A study of 52 species of North American migratory birds, based on >70,000 specimens, showed that spring migration phenology has advanced over the past 40 years, concurrent with widespread shifts in morphology (reduced body size and increased wing length), perhaps to compensate for the increased metabolic cost of flight as body size decreases (Weeks et al., 2020)."

Recent advances in mechanistic understanding (from experiments), in process-based modelling (including micro-climates and developmental processes) (Carter and Janzen, 2021) and in the sophistication of niche models (Kearney et al., 2009) have improved projections, but comprehensive tests of geographic patterns and processes in thermal tolerance and plasticity are still lacking, with studies limited to a few phylogenetically restricted analyses showing mixed results (Gunderson and Stillman, 2015). Improved understanding of the mechanistic basis for observed geographic patterns in thermal tolerance and plasticity is needed to identify the physiological limits of species, the potential for adaptation and the presence of evolutionary trade-offs, which will strongly influence population declines, species range shifts, invasive interactions and the success of conservation interventions (Cooke et al., 2021; Ryan and Gunderson, 2021)."

AR4 found weak-to-moderate evidence that disease vectors and their diseases had changed their distributions in concert with climate change, but attribution studies were lacking (Smith et al., 2014). In AR5, WGII AR5 Chapter 11, geographic expansion of a few VBDs to higher latitudes and elevations were detected and associated with regional climate trends, but the non-climatic drivers were not well assessed, leading to a medium confidence in attribution (Smith et al., 2014)).

wg2_ch02_2.4.2.8_p3,NO_TITLE,"An increasing number of studies document evolutionary responses to climate change in populations not at their warm range limits (Franks and Hoffmann, 2012). Organisms with short generation times should have a higher capacity to genetically track climate change than species with long generation times, such as mammals (Boutin and Lane, 2014). Indeed, observed evolutionary impacts have been mainly documented in insects, especially at expanding range margins (Chuang and Peterson, 2016) where evolutionary changes have increased dispersal ability (Thomas et al., 2001) and decreased host specialisation (Bridle et al., 2014; Lancaster, 2020) (medium evidence, medium agreement)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.2.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"Away from range margins, individual populations experiencing regional warming have evolved diverse traits related to climate adaptation. For example, pitcher-plant mosquitoes (Wyeomyia smithii)  in Pacific Northwest America have evolved to wait for shorter days before initiating diapause. This adaptation to lengthening summers enables them to delay overwintering until later and add an extra generation each year (Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2001). Among 26 populations of Drosophila subobscura studied on three continents, 22 experienced climate warming across two or more decades, and 21 of these 22 showed increasing frequency of the chromosome inversion characteristic of populations adapted to hot climates  (robust evidence, high agreement)  (Balanya et al., 2006)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.2.8_p5,NO_TITLE,"However, for populations already at their warm range limits, their ability to track climate change in situ would require evolving to survive and reproduce outside their species’ historical climate envelope: abilities of wild species to do this is not supported by experimental or observational evidence (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Singer, 2017). Whether or not they can depends on the level of ‘niche conservatism’ operating at the species level (Lavergne et al., 2010). If a species whose range limits are determined by climate finds itself completely outside of its traditional climate envelope, extinction is expected in the absence of ‘evolutionary rescue’ (Bell and Gonzalez, 2009; Bell et al., 2019)."

Tests of thermal performance have been complicated, as both long-term acclimation and trans-generational effects occur (Sgro et al., 2016). However, the results to date have been consistent: despite widespread local adaptation to climate across species’ ranges, substantial constraints exist regarding the evolution of greater stress tolerance (e.g., high temperatures and drought) at warm range limits (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Hoffmann and Sgro, 2011; MacLean et al., 2019b)."

In Leigh et al. (2019), genetic declines were documented in both common and already endangered species of fish, mammals, birds, insects, amphibians and reptiles. These declines in genetic diversity, though not caused by climate change, decrease the abilities of wild species to adapt to climate change via evolutionary responses.

wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change has already caused some species to become extinct and is expected to drive more species to extinction. Extinction of species has always occurred in the history of our planet, but human activities are accelerating this process, such that the estimated 10% of species that humans have driven to extinction in the past 10,000 years is roughly 1,000 times the natural background rate. Recent research predicts that climate change would add to that, with estimates that about one-third of all plant and animal species are at high risk of extinction by 2070 if climate change continues at its current rate. Species can adapt to some extent to these rapidly changing climate patterns. We are seeing changes in behaviour, dispersal to new areas as the climate becomes more suitable, and genetic evolution. However, these changes are small, and adaptations are limited. Species that cannot adapt beyond their basic climate tolerances (their ability to survive extremes of temperature or rainfall) or successfully reproduce in a different climate environment from that in which they have evolved, will simply disappear. In the Arctic, for example, the sea ice is melting and, unless there are deep cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, will probably disappear in summer within the century. This means that the animals that have evolved to live on sea ice—polar bears and some seals—will become extinct soon after the ice disappears."

wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"‘Assisting’ the migration of species. This has many names, ‘assisted colonisation’, ‘assisted translocation’, ‘assisted migration’ and ‘assisted movement’. In effect, it is about helping endangered species to move to a new area with a good habitat for them to survive. ‘Passive’ assisted colonisation focusses on helping species move themselves, while the most ‘active’ form implies picking up individuals and transporting them to a new location. This is different from reintroductions that are already a normal part of conservation programs. Climate-driven translocations constitute moving plants or animals to an area where they have never lived historically, a new location that is now suitable for them due to climate change."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"This active form of ‘assisted colonisation’ has been controversial, because exotic species can become invasive when they are moved between continents or oceans. For example, no one would advocate moving polar bears to Antarctica, as they would likely feast on native penguins, thus causing another conservation problem. However, moving species only a few hundred kilometers avoids most adverse outcomes, and this is often all that is needed to help a wild plant or animal cope with lower levels of climate change. In extreme cases, another type of assisted adaptation is to preserve species until we can stabilize then reverse climate change, and then reintroduce them to the wild. This might include moving them into zoos or into seed or frozen embryo banks."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Extending protected zones and their connectivity. The ability of species to move to new locations and track climate change are very limited, particularly when a habitat has been turned into a crop field or a city. To help species move between their natural habitats, we can increase the connectedness of protected areas, or simply create small patches or corridors of semi-wild nature within a largely agricultural or inhabited region that encourages wildlife to move through an area, and in which they are protected from hunting and poisons. These semi-wild protected areas can be very small, like the hedgerows between fields in England that provide both a habitat for many flowers, birds and insects and corridors to move between larger protected areas. Alternatively, it can just be an abandoned field that is now growing ‘weeds’ and with a ban on use of pesticides or herbicides, hunting or farming. For instance, in the USA, private landowners get a tax break by making their land a ‘wildlife conservation’ area by using no pesticide, not cutting weeds too often, putting up brush piles and bird boxes for nesting by mammals and birds, and providing a stable water source."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Assisting, protecting and conserving natural ecosystems would help enhance biodiversity overall as well as aiding already endangered species. Diverse plant and animal communities are more resilient to disturbances, including climate change. A healthy ecosystem also recovers more quickly from increases in extreme events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves, that are a part of human-driven climate change. Healthy ecosystems are critical to prevent species’ extinctions from climate change, but are also important for human health and well-being, providing clean, plentiful water, cleaning the air, providing recreation and holiday adventures, and making people feel happier, calmer and more content."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Diseases transmitted between humans and animals are called zoonoses. Zoonoses comprise nearly two-thirds of known human infectious diseases and the majority of newly emerging ones. COVID-19 is the most recent zoonosis and has killed millions of people globally while devastating economies. The risk posed by Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) has increased because of: (1) the movement of wild animals and their parasites into new areas as a result of climate change, global trade and travel; (2) human intrusion in natural areas and the conversion of natural areas for agriculture, livestock, the extraction of industrial/raw materials and housing; (3) increased wildlife trade and consumption; (4) increased human mobility resulting from global trade, war/conflicts and migration, made faster and extending farther due to fossil fuel-powered travel; and (5) widespread antimicrobial use, which can promote antibiotic-resistant infections (Figure FAQ2.2.1)."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate change further increases risk by altering pathogen and host animal (1) geographic ranges and habitats; (2) survival, growth and development; (3) reproduction and replication; (4) transmission and exposure (5) behaviour; and (6) access to immunologically naïve animals and people who lack resistance to infection. This can lead to novel disease emergence in new places, more frequent and larger outbreaks, and longer or shifted seasons of transmission. Climate change is making it possible for many EIDs to colonise historically colder areas that are becoming warmer and wetter in temperate and polar regions and in the mountains. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are diseases spread by vectors such as mosquitoes, sand flies, kissing bugs and ticks. For example, ticks that carry the virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis have moved into the northern subarctic regions of Asia and Europe. Viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. Novel outbreaks of Vibrio bacteria seafood poisoning are being traced to the the Baltic States and Alaska where they were never documented before. Many scientific studies show that the transmission of infectious disease and the number of individuals infected depends on rainfall and temperature; climate change often makes these conditions more favourable for disease transmission."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Climate change can also have complicated, compounding and contradictory effects on pathogens and vectors. Increased rainfall creates more habitat for mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria, but too much rain washes away the habitat. Decreased rainfall also increases disease risk when people without reliable access to water use containers to store water where mosquitoes, such as the vectors of dengue fever Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, lay their eggs. Hotter temperatures also increase mosquito-bite rate, parasite development and viral replication! Certain species of snails are intermediate hosts for many helminth parasites that make humans, livestock and wild animals sick. When it gets hot, the snails can produce 2–3 times as many infective larvae; however, if it becomes too hot, many pathogens and their vectors cannot survive or reproduce."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Humans also contract zoonoses directly through their skin, mucus membranes and lungs, when eating or butchering animals or when they come into contact with pathogens that are shed into the air or passed in urine and faeces and contaminate water, food, clothing and other surfaces. Any activity that increases contact with wildlife, especially in high-biodiversity regions like the Tropics and subtropics, increases disease risk. Climate change-related disease emergence events are often rare but may become more frequent. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce risks and protect our health, as described below."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Habitat and biodiversity protection. Human encroachment into natural areas, due to expansion of agriculture and livestock, timber harvests, extraction of resources and urban development, has increased human contact with wild animals and creates more opportunities for disease spill-over (transmission from an animal to a new species, including humans). By conserving, protecting and restoring wild habitats, we can build healthier ecosystems that provide other services, such as clean air, clean and abundant water, recreation, spiritual value and well-being, as well as reduced disease spill-over. If humans must go into wild areas or hunt, they should take appropriate precautions such as wearing protective clothing, using insect repellant, performing body checks for vectors like ticks and washing their hands and clothing well."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Food resilience. Investing in sustainable agro-ecological farming will alleviate the pressure to hunt wild animals and reduce the conversion of more land to agriculture/livestock use. Stopping illegal animal trading and poaching and decreasing reliance on wild meats and products made from animal parts will reduce direct contact with potentially infected animals. This has the added benefit of increasing food security and nutrition, improving soil, reducing erosion, preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change."

wg2_ch02_2.4.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The most robust attribution studies use data from many species, individual locations with minimal confounding factors, particularly observed recent LULCC, and scale up by analysing multiple locations across a large zone between biomes, providing multiple lines of evidence (Hegerl et al., 2010; Parmesan et al., 2013). Multivariate statistical analyses aid attribution studies by allowing the assessment of relative weights among multiple factors, including variables related to climate change (Gonzalez et al., 2012). However, drivers often have strong, significant interactions with one another, complicating quantitative assessment of the strength of individual drivers (Parmesan et al., 2013). In these cases, manipulative experiments are critical in assessing attribution to the drivers of climate change."
wg2_ch02_2.4.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Certain biomes exhibit a relatively stronger relationship to climate; for example, Arctic tundra generally has a distinct ecotone with boreal conifer forest (Whittaker, 1975). In these areas, attribution of biome shifts to climate change are relatively straightforward, if human LULCC is minimal. However, other biomes, such as many grassland systems, are not in equilibrium with climate (Bond et al., 2005). In these systems, their evolutionary history (Keeley et al., 2011; Strömberg, 2011; Charles-Dominique et al., 2016), distribution, structure and function have been shaped by climate and natural disturbances, such as fire and herbivory (Staver et al., 2011; Lehmann et al., 2014; Pausas, 2015; Bakker et al., 2016; Malhi et al., 2016). Disturbance variability is an inherent characteristic of grassland systems, and suitable ‘control’ conditions are seldom available in nature. Furthermore, due to the integral role of disturbance, these biomes have been widely affected by long-term and widespread shifts in grazing regimes, large-scale losses of mega-herbivores and fire suppression policies (Archibald et al., 2013; Malhi et al., 2016; Hempson et al., 2017). It is necessary to conduct climate change attribution on a case-by-case basis for grasslands; such assessments are complex as direct climate change impacts from either inherent variation within disturbance regimes or directional changes in background disturbances are difficult to separate (detailed in Sections 2.4.3.2.1; 2.4.3.2.2; 2.4.3.5).

The magnitude of woody cover change in savannas is not correlated with mean annual temperature change (Criado et al., 2020); however, higher atmospheric CO2 increases shrub growth in savannas (Nackley et al., 2018; Manea and Leishman, 2019). A global remote-sensing analysis of biome changes from all causes, including agricultural and grazing expansion and deforestation, estimated that 14% of pixels changed between 1981 and 2012, although this approach can overestimate global changes, since it uses a new biome classification system which doubles the conventional biome classifications (Higgins et al., 2016).

High mortality in the Clanwilliam cedar tree between 1931 and 2013 occurred at lower, hotter elevations in the Fynbos of South Africa (White et al., 2016). Drought reduced growth and increased mortality of the holm oak, Quercus ilex, on the Iberian Peninsula of Spain (Natalini et al. (2016). Portuguese shrublands experienced losses of many deciduous and evergreen oak species, and an increasing dominance of pyrophytic xeric trees (Acácio et al., 2017). The 2012–2015 drought in California caused high-canopy foliage dieback of the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (Stephenson et al., 2019), increased the dominance of oaks relative to pines as a result of the increased water deficit, and led to large-scale tree mortality due to interactions of drought and insect pest outbreaks (McIntyre et al., 2015; Fettig et al., 2019)."

Reduced winter precipitation caused native annual forbs to recede, resulting in long-lasting and potentially unidirectional reductions in diversity in a Californian grassland (Harrison et al., 2018). More frequent extreme hot and dry weather between 1966 and 2010 caused a decline in diversity during the post-fire regeneration phase in the Fynbos of South Africa (Slingsby et al., 2017), resulting in shifts towards species with higher temperature preferences (Slingsby et al., 2017).

However, it is expected that grasslands in hot areas will decrease production as temperatures increase (limited evidence, low agreement ) (Gang et al., 2015). Nevertheless, grassland responses to warming and drought are being ameliorated by increasing CO2 and associated improved water-use efficiency (Roy et al., 2016).

In contrast, the carbon sink (and hence the rate of biomass gain) in intact African forests was stable until 2010 and has only recently started to decline, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation in Amazonia and Africa, the difference being driven by rates of tree mortality (Hubau et al., 2020).

Vulnerability to drought varies between tree species and sizes, with large, older trees at the highest risk of mortality (McDowell et al., 2018; Meakem et al., 2018).

Animals such as moose, beavers and songbirds may already be responding to these vegetation changes by expanding their ranges northward or upslope into shrub tundra (Boelman et al., 2015; Tape et al., 2016a; Tape et al., 2016b; Tape et al., 2018)."

Soil moisture status influences temperature sensitivity of plant growth and canopy heights (Myers-Smith et al., 2015 ; Ackerman et al., 2017; Bjorkman et al., 2018). In tundra ecosystems, permafrost thawing can decouple below-ground plant growth dynamics from above-ground dynamics, with below-ground root growth continuing until soils re-freeze in autumn (Cross-Chapter Paper 6) (Iversen et al., 2015; Blume-Werry et al., 2016; Radville et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In boreal coniferous areas, there has been an increase in the transporting of terrestrial-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into rivers and lakes, which has caused increased opacity and a shift toward a brown colour (browning). There was little assessment of this in AR5. This process is driven by climate change, and stems from hydrological intensification, greening of the Northern Hemisphere and degradation of carbon sinks in peatlands  (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Solomon et al., 2015; Catalán et al., 2016; de Wit et al., 2016; Finstad et al., 2016; Creed et al., 2018; Hayden et al., 2019). These factors enhance terrestrial productivity, alter vegetation communities and affect the hydrological control of the production and transport of DOC (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2016). Non-climate-related drivers of browning are: declining atmospheric sulphur deposition, forestry practices and LULCCs (see Table SM2.1 for detail)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Browning creates a positive feedback to climate by absorbing photosynthetically active radiation, which accelerates upper water (epilimnetic) warming (Solomon et al., 2015). Browning of lakes leads to shallower and more stable thermoclines, and thus overall deep water cooling (Solomon et al., 2015; Williamson et al., 2015), and can provoke a transition of the seasonal mixing regime from a mixed lake (polymictic) to one that is seasonally stratified (Kirillin and Shatwell, 2016)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The ecological responses of browning are a concomitant effect of climate change and nutrient status. Results from long-term, large-scale lake experiments have been variable, showing both strong synergistic effects (Urrutia-Cordero et al., 2016) and no significant effects of browning on plankton community food webs (Rasconi et al., 2015). Browning has driven a shift from auto- to heterotrophic/mixotrophic-based production (Urrutia-Cordero et al., 2017) and supports heterotrophic metabolism of the bacterial community (Zwart et al., 2016). Browning may also accelerate primary production through the input of nutrients associated with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in nutrient-poor lakes and increase cyanobacteria, which cope better with low light intensities (Huisman et al., 2018) and toxin levels (Urrutia-Cordero et al., 2016). However, the synergistic impacts of browning and climate change on aquatic communities depends on regional precipitation patterns (Weyhenmeyer et al., 2016), watershed type (de Wit et al., 2016) and the length of the food chain (Hansson et al., 2013). Quantitative attribution of browning to climate change remains difficult (medium evidence, medium agreement )."

wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Wildfire is a natural and essential component of many forest and other terrestrial ecosystems. Excessive wildfire, however, can kill people, cause respiratory disease, destroy houses, emit carbon dioxide and damage ecosystem integrity (see Sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.4.4.4). Anthropogenic climate change increases wildfire by exacerbating its three principal driving factors: heat, fuel and ignition (Moritz et al., 2012; Jolly et al., 2015). Non-climatic factors also contribute to wildfires—in tropical areas, fires are set intentionally to clear forest for agricultural fields and livestock pastures (Bowman et al., 2020). Urban areas and roads create ignition hazards. Governments in many temperate-zone countries implement policies to suppress fires, even natural ones, producing unnatural accumulations of fuel in the form of coarse woody debris and high densities of small trees (Ruffault and Mouillot, 2015; Hessburg et al., 2016; Andela et al., 2017; Balch et al., 2017; Lasslop and Kloster, 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; Kelley et al., 2019). Globally, 4.2 million km 2 of land per year burned on average from 2002 to 2016 (Giglio et al., 2018), with the highest fire frequencies in the Amazon rainforest, deciduous forests and savannas in Africa and deciduous forests in northern Australia (Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Andela et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since the AR5 and the IPCC Special Report on Land, published research has detected increases in the area burned by wildfire, analysed relative contributions of climate and non-climate factors and attributed burned area increases above natural (recent historical) levels to anthropogenic climate change in one part of the world, western North America (robust evidence, high agreement)  (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Partain et al., 2016; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019; Mansuy et al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020). Across the western USA, increases in vegetation aridity due to higher temperatures from anthropogenic climate change doubled burned area from 1984 to 2015 over what would have burned due to non-climate factors including unnatural fuel accumulation from fire suppression, with the burned area attributed to climate change accounting for 49% (32–76%, 95% confidence interval) of cumulative burned area (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). Anthropogenic climate change doubled the severity of a southwest North American drought from 2000 to 2020 that has reduced soil moisture to its lowest levels since the 1500s (Williams et al., 2020), driving half of the increase in burned area (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Holden et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2019). In British Columbia, Canada, the increased maximum temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change increased burned area in 2017 to its highest extent in the 1950–2017 record, seven to eleven times the area that would have burned without climate change (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019). In Alaska, USA, the high maximum temperatures and extremely low relative humidity due to anthropogenic climate change accounted for 33–60% of the probability of wildfire in 2015, when the area burned was the second highest in the 1940–2015 record (Partain et al., 2016). In protected areas of Canada and the USA, climate factors (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and evapotranspiration) accounted for 60% of burned area from local human and natural ignitions from 1984 to 2014, outweighing local human factors (population density, roads and built area) (Mansuy et al., 2019)."

wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Regarding global terrestrial area as a whole, wildfire trends vary depending on the time period of analysis. From 1900 to 2000, global average fire frequency, based on field data, increased 0.4% but the change was not statistically significant (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Fire frequency increased on one-third of global land, mainly from burning for agricultural clearing in Africa, Asia and South America, slightly less than the area of fire frequency decrease, mainly from fire suppression across Australia, North America and Russia (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Analyses of the Global Fire Emissions Database document shows that, from 1996 to 2015, global burned area decreased at a rate of −0.7% yr -1 (Forkel et al., 2019) but the change was not statistically significant (Giglio et al., 2013). From 1998 to 2015, global burned area decreased at a rate of −1.4 ± 0.5% yr -1 (Andela et al., 2017). The area of fire increases was one-third of the area of decreases, due to reduced vegetation cover from agricultural expansion and intensification (Andela et al., 2017) and from increased precipitation (Forkel et al., 2019). Furthermore, much of the decreasing trend derives from two years: 1998 with a high burned area and 2013 with low burned area (Forkel et al., 2019). Wildfire does not show a clear long-term trend for the world as a whole because of increases and decreases in different regions (medium evidence, medium agreement )."
wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Where the global average burned area has decreased in the past two decades, higher correlations of rates of change in burning to human population density, cropland area and livestock density than to precipitation indicate that agricultural expansion and intensification were the main causes (Andela et al., 2017). The global decrease of fire frequency from 2000 to 2010 is correlated with increasing human population density (Knorr et al., 2014). The fire-reducing effect of reduced vegetation cover following expansion of agriculture and livestock herding can counteract the fire-increasing effect of the increased heat and drying associated with climate change (Lasslop and Kloster, 2017; Arora and Melton, 2018; Forkel et al., 2019). The reduced burning needed after the initial clearing for agricultural expansion drives much of the decline in fires in the Tropics (Andela et al., 2017; Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Forkel et al., 2019). The human influence on fire ignition can be seen through the decrease documented on holy days (Sundays and Fridays) and traditional religious days of rest (Earl et al., 2015). Overall, human land use exerts an influence on wildfire trends for global terrestrial area as a whole that can be stronger than climate change (medium confidence)."

wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"In the Amazon, deforestation for agricultural expansion and the degradation of forests adjacent to deforested areas cause wildfire in moist humid tropical forests not adapted to fire (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Fonseca et al., 2017; van Marle et al., 2017; da Silva et al., 2018 ; da Silva et al., 2021; dos Reis et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). Roads facilitate deforestation, fragmenting the rainforest and increasing the dryness and flammability of vegetation (Alencar et al., 2015). Extreme droughts that occur during warm phases of the ENSO and the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation combine with the degradation of vegetation to cause extreme fire events (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Fonseca et al., 2017; Aragao et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2018 ; Burton et al., 2020; dos Reis et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). In the State of Roraima, Brazil, distance to roads and infrastructure that enable deforestation and ENSO were the factors most explaining fire occurrence in the extreme 2015–2016 fire season (Fonseca et al., 2017). From 1973 to 2014, burned area increased in the Amazon, coinciding with increased deforestation (van Marle et al., 2017). In the State of Acre, Brazil, burned area increased 36-fold from 1984 to 2016, with 43% burned in agricultural and livestock settlement areas (da Silva et al., 2018 ). In the extreme fire year 2019, 85% of the area burned in the Amazon occurred in areas deforested in 2018 (Cardil et al., 2020). Even though relatively higher moisture in 2019 led to burning below the 2002–2019 average across most of South America, burning in areas of recent deforestation in the Amazon were above the 2002–2019 average, indicating that deforestation, not meteorological conditions, triggered the 2019 fires (Kelley et al., 2021; Libonati et al., 2021). Furthermore, from 1981 to 2018, deforestation in the Amazon reduced moisture inputs to the lower atmosphere, increasing drought and fire in a self-reinforcing feedback (Xu et al., 2020). In the Amazon, deforestation exerts an influence on wildfire that can be stronger than climate change (robust evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"In Australia, burned area increased significantly between the periods 1950–2002 and 2003–2020 in the southeast state of Victoria, with the area burned in the 2019–2020 bushfires being the highest on record (Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020). In addition to the deaths of dozens of people and the destruction of thousands of houses, the 2019–2020 bushfires burned almost half of the area protected for conservation in Victoria, two-thirds of the forests allocated for timber harvesting (Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020), wildlife and extensive areas of habitat for threatened plant and animal species (Geary et al., 2021). Generally, past timber harvesting did not lead to more severe fire canopy damage (Bowman et al., 2021b). Across southeastern Australia, the fraction of vegetated area that burned increased significantly in eight of the 32 bioregions from 1975 to 2009, but decreased significantly in three bioregions (Bradstock et al., 2014). Increases in four bioregions were correlated to increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. Decreases in burned area occurred despite increased temperature and decreased precipitation. Analyses of climate across Australia from 1950 to 2017 (Dowdy, 2018; Harris and Lucas, 2019) and during periods with extensive fires in 2017 in eastern Australia (Hope et al., 2019), in 2018 in northeastern Australia (Lewis et al., 2020), and in period 2019–2020 in southeastern Australia (Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021) indicate that temperature and drought extremes due to the ENSO, Southern Annular Mode and other natural inter-decadal cycles drive inter-annual variability of fire weather. While the effects of inter-decadal climate cycles on fire are superimposed on long-term climate change, the relative importance of anthropogenic climate change in explaining changes in burned area in Australia remains unquantified (medium evidence, high agreement )."

These decreases coincided with areas of agricultural expansion or areas where drought reduced fuel loads (Zubkova et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2020). It is possible, however, that the 500-m spatial resolution of Modis remote-sensing fire data underestimates the area burned in Africa by half, by missing small fires (Ramo et al., 2021). In the Serengeti-Mara savanna of east Africa, burned area showed no significant change from 2001 to 2014, although an increase in domestic livestock would tend to reduce the grass cover that fuels savanna fires (Probert et al., 2019)."

Increased summer maximum temperature and decreased soil moisture explained most of the burned area observed, suggesting a contribution of climate change, but fire suppression, fire prevention, agricultural abandonment and reforestation as well as the reduction in forest area exerted even stronger influences on burned area than the climate across Mediterranean Europe (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Moreno et al., 2014; Turco et al., 2017; Viedma et al., 2018; Turco et al., 2019)."

wg2_ch02_2.4.4.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC AR6 WGI assessed fire weather (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), while this chapter assesses the impacts of changes in fire weather: burned area and fire frequency. The global increases in temperature from anthropogenic climate change have increased aridity and drought, lengthening the fire weather season (the annual period with a heat and aridity index greater than half of its annual range) on one-quarter of global vegetated area and increasing the average fire season length by one-fifth from 1979 to 2013 (Jolly et al., 2015). Climate change has contributed to increases in the fire weather season or the probability of fire weather conditions in the Amazon (Jolly et al., 2015), Australia (Dowdy, 2018; Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021), Canada (Hanes et al., 2019), central Asia (Jolly et al., 2015), East Africa (Jolly et al., 2015) and North America (Jain et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2019; Goss et al., 2020). In forest areas, the burned area correlates with fuel aridity, a function of temperature; in non-forest areas, the burned area correlates with high precipitation in the previous year, which can produce high grass fuel loads (Abatzoglou et al., 2018). Fire use in agriculture and raising livestock or other factors have generated a second fire season on approximately one-quarter of global land where fire is present, despite sub-optimal fire weather in the second fire season (Benali et al., 2017). In summary, anthropogenic climate change, through a 0.9°C surface temperature increase since the pre-industrial period, has lengthened or increased the frequency of periods with heat and aridity that favour wildfire on up to one-quarter of vegetated area since 1979 (robust evidence, high agreement )."

Research since the AR5 has also found vegetation changes from wildfire due to climate change. Through increased temperature and aridity, anthropogenic climate change has driven post-fire changes in plant regeneration and species composition in South Africa (Slingsby et al., 2017), and tree regeneration in the western USA (Davis et al., 2019b). In the fynbos vegetation of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, post-fire heat and drought and the legacy effects of exotic plant species reduced the regeneration of native plant species, decreasing species richness by 12% from 1966 to 2010 and shifting the average temperature tolerance of species communities upward by 0.5°C (Slingsby et al., 2017). In burned areas across the western USA, the increasing heat and aridity of anthropogenic climate change from 1979 to 2015 pushed low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests across critical thresholds of heat and aridity that reduced the post-fire tree regeneration by half (Davis et al., 2019b). In the southwestern USA, where anthropogenic climate change has caused drought (Williams et al., 2019) and increased wildfire (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016), high-severity fires have converted some forest patches to shrublands (Barton and Poulos, 2018). Field evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change and wildfire, together, altered vegetation species composition in the southwestern USA and Cape floristic region, South Africa, reducing post-fire natural regeneration and species richness of tree and other plant species, between 1966 and 2015, at GMST increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C (medium evidence, high agreement )."

In Algeria, mortality of the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) increased from 1980 to 2006, coinciding with a ~1°C spring temperature increase, but non-climate factors were not examined (Navarro-Cerrillo et al., 2019). Across southern Africa, nine of the 13 oldest known (1100–2500 years old) baobab trees (Adansonia digitata) have died since 2005, although the causes are unknown (Patrut et al., 2018). In South Africa, savanna trees experienced an order of magnitude increase in mortality, related, but not formally attributed to, decreased rainfall (Case et al., 2019).

Across the western USA, anthropogenic climate change doubled tree mortality between 1955 and 2007 (van Mantgem et al., 2009). Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) mortality increased 700% from 2000 to 2013 (Anderegg et al., 2015) and piñon pine (P. edulis) experienced >50% mortality from 2002 to 2014 (Redmond et al., 2018). In montane conifer forest in California, anthropogenic climate change has increased tree mortality by one-quarter (Goulden and Bales, 2019). One-quarter of the trees died in some areas, with mortality rates of ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) and sugar pine (P. lambertiana) increasing to up to 700% of pre-drought rates (Stephenson et al., 2019; Stovall et al., 2019).

wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Human-caused climate change increases wildfire by intensifying its principal driving factor, heat. The heat of climate change dries out vegetation and accelerates burning. Non-climate factors also cause wildfires. Agricultural companies, small-scale farmers and livestock herders in many tropical areas cut down forests and intentionally set fires to clear fields and pastures. Cities, towns and roads increase the number of fires that people ignite. Governments in many countries suppress fires, even natural ones, producing unnatural accumulations of fuel in the form of coarse woody debris and dense stands of small trees. The fuel accumulations cause particularly severe fires that burn upwards into tree crowns."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Evidence shows that human-caused climate change has driven increases in the area burned by wildfire in the forests of western North America. Across this region, the higher temperatures of human-caused climate change doubled burned area from 1984 to 2015, compared with what would have burned without climate change (Figure FAQ2.3.1b). The additional area burned, 4.9 million hectares, is greater than the land area of Switzerland. Human-caused climate change drove a drought from 2000 to 2020 that has been the most severe since the 1500s, severely increasing the aridity of vegetation. In British Columbia, Canada, the higher maximum temperatures of human-caused climate change increased burned area in 2017 to its widest extent in the 1950–2017 record, seven to eleven times the area that would have burned without climate change. Moreover, in national parks and other protected areas of Canada and the USA, most of the area burned from 1984 to 2014 can be attributed to climate factors (temperature, rainfall and aridity) and these outweigh local human factors (population density, roads and urban area)."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"In other regions, wildfires are also burning wider areas and occurring more often. This is consistent with climate change, but analyses have not yet shown if climate change is more important than other factors. In the Amazon, deforestation by companies, farmers and herders who cut down and intentionally burn rainforests to expand agricultural fields and pastures causes wildfires even in relatively moister years. Drought exacerbates these fires. In Australia, much of the southeastern part of the continent has experienced extreme wildfire years, but analyses suggest that El Niño, a heat phenomenon that cycles up and down periodically, is more important than long-term climate change. In Indonesia, intentional burning of rainforests for oil palm plantations and El Niño seem to be more important than long-term climate change. In Mediterranean Europe, fire suppression seems to have prevented any increasing trend in burned area but the suppression and abandonment of agricultural lands have allowed fuel to build up in some areas and contribute to major fires in years of extreme heat. In Canada and Siberia, wildfires are now burning more often in permafrost areas where fire was rare, but analyses are lacking regarding the relative influence of climate change. For the world as a whole, satellite data indicate that the vast amount of land converted from forest to farmland in the period 1998–2015 actually decreased the total burned area. Nevertheless, the evidence from the forests of western North America shows that human-caused climate change has, at least on one continent, clearly driven increases in wildfire."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"The consistency of patterns of biological change with expectations from regional or global warming processes, coupled with an understanding of underlying processes and the coherence of these patterns at both regional and global scales, all form multiple lines of evidence (Parmesan et al., 2013) that it is very likely  that the observed range shifts and phenological changes in individual species can be attributed to regional and global climate changes (very high confidence) (Section 2.4.2, Table 2.2; Table 2.3; Table SM2.1) (Parmesan et al., 2013)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Global and regional meta-analyses of diverse systems, habitats and taxonomic groupings document that approximately half of all species with long-term records have shifted their ranges poleward and/or upward in elevation and ~2/3 have advanced their timing of spring events (phenology) (very high confidence)  (Section 2.4.2, Table 2.2) (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015; Parmesan, 2019). Changes in abundance tend to match predictions from climate warming, with warm-adapted species significantly outperforming cold-adapted species in warming habitats (Feeley et al., 2020) and the composition of local communities becoming more ‘thermophilised’, that is, experiencing an ‘increase in relative abundance of heat-loving or heat-tolerant species’ (high confidence)  (Section 2.4.2.3) (Cline et al., 2013; Feeley et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"New studies since AR5, with more sophisticated analyses designed to capture complex responses, indicate that past estimates of the proportion of species impacted by recent climate change were underestimates due to unspoken assumptions that local or regional warming should lead solely to poleward/upward range shifts and advancements of spring timing  (high confidence)  (Duffy et al., 2019). More complex analyses have documented cases of winter warming driving delayed spring timing of northern temperate species due to chilling requirements, and increased precipitation driving species’ range shifts downslope in elevation, and eastward and westward in arid regions (high confidence). Further new studies have shown that phenological changes have, in some cases, successfully compensated for local climate change and reduced the extent of range shifts (medium confidence). The limited number of studies of this type make it difficult to estimate the generality of these effects globally (Section 2.4.2.5, Table 2.2)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Responses in freshwater species are consistent with responses in terrestrial species, including poleward and upward range shifts, earlier timing of spring plankton development, earlier spawning by fish and the extension of the growing season  (high confidence). Observed changes in freshwater species are strongly related to anthropogenic climate change-driven changes in the physical environment (e.g., increased water temperature, reduced ice cover, reduced mixing in lakes, loss of oxygen and reduced river connectivity) (high confidence). While evidence is robust  for an increase in primary production in nutrient rich lakes along with warming trends (high confidence), increasing or declining algal formations are lake-specific and are modulated through variability in weather conditions, lake morphology, changes in salinity, stoichiometry, land use and restoration measures and food web interactions. In boreal coniferous forest, there has been an increase in terrestrial-derived DOM transported into rivers and lakes as a consequence of climate change (which has induced increases in runoff and greening of the Northern Hemisphere) as well as from changes in forestry practices. This has caused waters to become brown, resulting in an acceleration of upper-water warming and an overall cooling of deep water (high confidence). Browning may accelerate primary production through the input of nutrients associated with DOM in nutrient-poor lakes and increases the growth of cyanobacteria, which cope better with low light intensity (medium confidence) (Sections 2.4.2.1, 2.4.2.2, 2.4.2.3, 2.4.2.4)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Field research since the AR5 has detected biome shifts at numerous sites, poleward and upslope, that are consistent with increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns driven by climate change, and support prior studies that attributed such shifts to anthropogenic climate change (high confidence). New studies help fill previous geographic and habitat gaps, for example, documenting upward shifts in the forest/alpine tundra ecotone in the Andes, Tibet and Nepal, and northward shifts in the deciduous/boreal forest ecotones in Canada. Globally, woody encroachment into open areas (grasslands, arid regions and tundra) is likely  being driven by climate change and increased CO2, in concert with changes in grazing and fire regimes (medium confidence) (Section 2.4.3)."

Analyses of causal factors have attributed increasing tree mortality at sites in Africa and North America to anthropogenic climate change, and field evidence has detected tree mortality due to drought, wildfires and insect pests in temperate and tropical forests around the world (high confidence). Water stress, leading to plant hydraulic failure, is a principal mechanism of drought-induced tree mortality, along with the indirect effects of climate change mediated by community interactions (high confidence) (Section 2.4.4.3)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Terrestrial ecosystems sequester and store globally critical stocks of carbon, but these stocks are at risk from deforestation and climate change (high confidence). Tropical deforestation and the draining and burning of peatlands produce almost all of the carbon emissions from LULCC. In the Arctic, increased temperatures have thawed permafrost at numerous sites, dried some areas and increased fires, causing net emissions of carbon from soils (high confidence) (Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.3.4)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"Globally, increases in temperature, aridity and drought have increased the length of fire seasons and doubled the potentially burnable land area (medium confidence). Increases in the area burned have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change in North America (high confidence). In parts of Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, the area burned has also increased, consistent with anthropogenic climate change. Deforestation, peat-burning, agricultural expansion or abandonment, fire suppression and inter-decadal cycles strongly influence fire occurrence. The areas with the greatest increases in the length of the fire season include the Amazon, western North America, western Asia and East Africa (Section 2.4.4.2)."
wg2_ch02_2.4.5_p9,NO_TITLE,"The changes in biodiversity and ecosystem health that we have observed, and project will continue, pose a risk of declines in human health and well-being (e.g., tourism, recreation, food, livelihoods and quality of life) (medium confidence). Clear attribution of these impacts is often not possible, but inferences can be made by comparison of the observed changes in biodiversity/ecosystem health and the known services from these particular ecosystems."
wg2_ch02_2.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Under the risk assessment framework that was introduced in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b), risk means the probability of harmful consequences resulting from climate change. It results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure and hazard and can be represented as the probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur (see Chapter 1, this report). The framework defines vulnerability as a pre-existing condition, incorporating the extent to which species or ecosystems are susceptible to, or unable to cope with, the adverse effects of climate change. Vulnerable species have limited adaptive capacity, stemming from physiological and behavioural constraints, limited dispersal abilities and restricted resource requirements or capacities for distributional and genetic changes (Foden et al., 2013; Cizauskas et al., 2017; Foden et al., 2019). Traits that render entire ecosystems vulnerable are harder to define, but it is clear that vulnerabilities are high in the coldest habitats, in those with limited geographic ranges such as low-lying islands and in specialised, restricted habitats such as serpentine outcrops in California (Anacker and Harrison, 2012) and dry meadows in Fennoscandia and Tibet (Yang et al., 2018a). Ecosystem vulnerability can depend critically on the fates of plants that function as ‘foundation species’, providing community biomass above and below the ground, structuring habitat for fauna and providing ecosystem services such as erosion control (Camac et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Methods for projecting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be classified into three types: (1) statistical models such as SDMs (Elith and Leathwick, 2009); (2) mechanistic or process-based models (Chuine and Régnière, 2017) and (3) trait-based models (Pacifici et al., 2015). It is only recently that models have been developed looking at lower levels of warming like 1.5°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Warren et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"SDMs or niche-based models assess potential geographic areas of suitable climate for the species in current conditions and then project them into future conditions (Trisurat, 2018; Vieira et al., 2018). There are limitations in all models and it is critical that modellers understand the assumptions, proper parameterization and limitations of each model technique, including differences between climate models, emission scenarios or RCPs and baselines (Araujo et al., 2019). Several systems automate the development of SDMs, including R-packages (Beaumont et al., 2016; Hallgren et al., 2016), and other model types (Foden et al., 2019) and aid in the use of climate model data (Suggitt et al., 2017), including allowing for connectivity constraints (Peterson et al., 2013). Buisson et al. (2010) found most variation in model outputs stems from differences in design, followed by general circulation models (GCMs)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Mechanistic approaches, also known as process-based models, project the responses of species to climate changes by explicitly incorporating known biological processes, thresholds and interactions (Morin and Thuiller, 2009; Maino et al., 2016). Mechanistic models are able to accommodate a broad range of mechanisms of climate change impacts and include species-specific characteristics such as dispersal distances, longevity, fecundity, genetic evolution and phenotypic plasticity. However, sufficient knowledge is available for only a few well-studied species. Species’ traits have been used to more broadly estimate potential climate change impacts (Foden et al., 2013; Cizauskas et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Most models are on a large scale (20–50 km), and so cannot capture micro-climatic refugia generated by diversities of slope aspect, elevation or shade (Suggitt et al., 2015; Suggitt et al., 2018). In analysing records of 430 climate-threatened and range-declining species in England, (Suggett et al., 2015; Suggitt et al., 2018) showed that topographic diversity reduced population declines most strongly in areas experiencing the most local warming and in the species most sensitive to warming. Under these circumstances, topographic diversity reduced the risk of population extinction by 22% for plants and 9% for insects."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"None of the modelling techniques are predictions of the future, they are rather projections of possible futures. To date, only a few studies have validated model performance against observations, but the studies that have been conducted do generally validate models using either SDMs or process-based models (Johnston et al., 2013; Fordham et al., 2018). SDMs should be considered as hypotheses of what a future world might look like if the climate projections came to pass. Suggestions have been made on how to start bringing more biotic interactions into SDMs (Early and Keith, 2019), but limited basic ecological understanding of interactions, along with limits on computation and funding, constrains how far and how fast these modelling techniques can advance."

wg2_ch02_2.5.1.2 _p1,NO_TITLE,"In order to add realism and reliability to risk assessments at the species and community levels, non-modelling approaches, based on known biological traits or processes as well as on expert opinion (Camac et al., 2021), are used to temper model outputs with ground-based validation. Trait-based assessment approaches use species’ biological characteristics as predictors of sensitivity, adaptive capacity and extinction risk due to climate change. Climate exposure can be estimated using GIS-based modelling, statistical programs or expert judgment (Chin et al., 2010). These trait-based approaches are widely applied to predict responses of biodiversity to climate change because they do not require modelling expertise or detailed distibutional data (Pacifici et al., 2015; Willis et al., 2015). Most of these methods have not been independently validated and do not allow direct comparison of vulnerability and risk across taxonomic groups."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.2 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Some studies have combined two or three approaches for the assessment of climate change risk to biodiversity, in order to capture the advantages of each and avoid their limitations. Warren et al. (2013) used combinations of SDMs and trait-based approaches to estimate the proportions of species losing their climatically suitable ranges under the various future scenarios of climate and dispersal rate. Similarly, spatial projections of exposure to climate change were combined with traits to assess the vulnerability of sub-Saharan amphibians (Garcia et al., 2014). Laurance et al. (2012) combined 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, in order to assess both the ecological integrity and threats to protected tropical areas on a global scale. Keith et al. (2014) used a combination of three approaches (SDMs–trait–mechanistic) to determine how long before extinction a species would become eligible for listing as threatened, based on the IUCN Red List criteria."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This assessment of current findings is of studies across a range of taxa and modelling techniques. Extinction risk estimates whether or not a particular species may be at risk of extinction over the coming decades if climatic trends continue, and usually does not take into account other human-induced stressors (e.g., invasive species or pollution). It is not a prediction that a species will definitely become extinct because, even when complete loss of a species’ range is projected, the scale of the model cannot estimate persistence in very small-scale micro-climatic refugia (that can be on the order of metres in size) (Suggitt et al., 2015; Suggitt et al., 2018). Individuals and populations can survive after the conditions for successful reproduction are gone, leading to a lagged decline, called ‘extinction debt’ (see section 2.4.2.8) (Alexander et al., 2018). Therefore, range loss is an established criterion for assessing endangerment status and risk of extinction. As a species range becomes smaller and occupied habitats become more isolated, the likelihood of a single stochastic event causing extinction increases. It is this combination of projected loss of climatically suitable space and additional stressors (especially LULCC of critical habitat) that is expected to drive future extinctions."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The IUCN Red List Criteria (IUCN, 2019) classifies a species as ‘critically endangered’ if it has suffered a range loss of ≥80%, with a resulting likelihood of extinction of >50% in the near term (10–100 yrs, depending upon generation length). A species is classified as ‘endangered’ if it has suffered a range loss of ≥50%, with a resulting likelihood of extinction of >20% in the near term (10–100 years). In this assessment, a species that is projected to become classified as ‘endangered’ is deemed to be at ‘high risk’ of extinction, and becoming classified as ‘critically endangered’ is deemed at ‘very high risk’ of extinction."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Because risk to freshwater species has been limited in past reports, this section provides details of freshwater risk. Lakes, rivers and freshwater wetlands cover approximately 7.7–9.1% of global land surface area; (Lehner et al., 2008; Fluet-Chouinard et al., 2015; Allen and Pavelsky, 2018) and hold 9.5% of the Earth’s described animals (Balian et al., 2008), with climate change indicated as a threat to 50–75% of fish (Xenopoulos et al., 2005; Darwall and Freyhof, 2015). Climate change is cited as a primary factor in species’ extinction risk due to changes in water temperatures, stream flow, loss of cold water habitat, increased variability of precipitation and increased disease risk from warming temperatures (robust evidence, high agreement , high confidence) (Knouft and Ficklin, 2017; Pletterbauer et al., 2018; Jaric et al., 2019; Reid et al., 2019) adding to the stress of overexploitation and LULCC (Craig et al., 2017; IPBES, 2019)."

Cold-water habitats and associated obligate species are particularly vulnerable, and losses in these habitats have been both documented and projected, for example, in salmonids (Santiago et al., 2016; Fullerton et al., 2017; Merriam et al., 2017). River networks are projected to lose connections to cold tributary refugia, that are important thermal refuges for cold water species (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Isaak et al., 2016) during low flows (Merriam et al., 2017)."

wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Molluscs are projected to be the most at-risk group, given their limited dispersal capability (Woodward et al., 2010). Mediterranean freshwater fish are especially susceptible to climate change due to increasing flood and drought events and the risk of surpassing critical temperature thresholds (Santiago et al., 2016; Jaric et al., 2019). In southern Europe, aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) are endangered by climate change (Conti et al., 2014). European protected areas are not expected to be sufficient under warming to provide habitat for the majority of rare molluscs and fish (Markovic et al., 2014).

Assessment of site-specific extirpation for 88 aquatic insect taxa projected that climate change-induced hydrological alteration would result in a 30–40% loss of taxa in warmer, drier ecoregions and a 10–20% loss in cooler, wetter ecoregions (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Pyne and Poff, 2017). In Africa’s Albertine Rift, 51% (n= 551) of fish are expected to be impacted by climate change, with 5.5% at a high risk due to their sensitivity and poor adaptative capability (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Carr et al., 2013)."

wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"In previous reports, risk assessed from the literature was generally based on estimates of overall range contractions with climate change. In AR4, extinction risk was carefully quantified: ‘There is medium confidence that approximately 20–30% of species assessed so far are likely  to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5–2.5°C (relative to mean temperatures from 1980–1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5°C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40–70% of species assessed) around the globe.’ These estimates approximately correspond to 50–80% reductions in range size (depending upon study), that this assessment equates with a ‘high’ and ‘very high’ extinction risk, respectively (IPCC, 2007). AR5 stated: ‘a large fraction of terrestrial and freshwater species face increased extinction risk under projected climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other pressures (high confidence)’ (Field et al., 2014).

wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"In this chapter, risk to species, with implications for ecosystems, is assessed using three different approaches. First is an assessment of the geographic distributions of local species’ losses at different levels of GSAT warming, termed ‘local biodiversity loss’, measured as the proportion of species within a given location becoming classified as “endangered” or worse  (sensu IUCN), and so at highrisk of local population losses (local population extinctions) (Figure 2.6). This measure provides the best estimates of which sites are at most risk of losing substantial numbers of species locally, leading to degradation of that ecosystem’s ability to function."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Second is assessment of the proportions of species becoming endangered globally (not just locally), so at highrisk of global extinction of the species, termed ‘global biodiversity loss’ (Figure 2.8b). This metric (losing > 50% of suitable climate space across the species’ entire range) also serves to estimate a species’ becoming sufficiently rare that the species no longer fully contributes to ecosystem functioning, a state that often occurs decades before complete extinction (death of the last individual). The proportions of species becoming at highrisk of global extinction is the foundation for the burning embers diagram on global biodiversity loss in Table 2.5 and Figure 2.11."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Third is an assessment of risk of the proportions of species becoming at very highrisk of extinction globally at different levels of GSAT warming, measured using the IUCN criteria for ‘critically endangered’, and termed ‘species’ extinction risk’ (Figure 2.7 and Figure 2.8a). This measure is closest to assessing the complete loss of a species in the wild and can be used to compare to past (palaeo) extinction rates. These three approaches provide complementary information of the overall risks to individual species, to biodiversity at the community scale, and to ecosystem integrity and functioning at different levels of warming."

That is, the deep orange and red areas in Figure 2.6 are those areas for which >50% of species currently inhabiting those ecosystems are projected to lose >50% of their climatically suitable habitat.

(Mathes et al., 2021) found evidence in the geological record that short-term rapid warming, on top of long-term warming trends, increases extinction risk by up to 40% over that expected from the long-term trend alone, with a biodiversity ‘memory’ of up to 60 Myr, indicating an additonal risk of multi-decadal overshoot."
wg2_ch02_2.5.1.3.3_p15,NO_TITLE,"Most of the large-scale studies that have been performed are for losses based on climate alone (Figures 2.6, 2.7, 2.8). However, climate is rarely the only stressor affecting species survival. Habitat loss is currently the largest driver of range loss and extinction risk for most species (IUCN, 2019). Communities in different regions are becoming more similar to each other as species tolerant of human activities prosper and spread, with many rare and endemic species already having been driven to extinction, primarily by LULCC (Pimm et al., 2006). Thus, it will likely be the interaction of climate change and habitat conversion (often driven by climate change) that will ultimately determine the risk and ability of many species to survive over the next century."

However, models predicting changes in infectious disease risk are complex and sometimes produce conflicting results and lack consensus (Caminade et al., 2014; Giesen et al., 2020). For example, malaria is projected to increase in some regions of Africa, Asia and South America by the end of the 21st century if public health interventions are not sufficient, but is also forecasted to decrease in some higher-risk areas (Cross-Chapter Box Illness in this chapter) (Peterson, 2009; Caminade et al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2015; Khormi and Kumar, 2016; Leedale et al., 2016; Murdock et al., 2016; Endo and Eltahir, 2020; Mordecai et al., 2020)."

In more temperate regions, arboviruses and other VBDs with wider thermal breadths, such as West Nile fever, Ross River fever and Lyme disease, are predicted to increase with climate warming (Ogden et al., 2008; Leighton et al., 2012; Shocket et al., 2018; Shocket et al., 2020; Couper et al., 2021).

A study examining the future risk of arboviruses (chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses) spread by A. aegypti and A. albopictus projected increased disease risk due to interactions of multiple variables, including increased human connectivity, urbanisation and climate change (Kraemer et al., 2019), although vector species’ ranges will broaden only slightly (Campbell et al., 2015)."

Since AR5, most DGVMs have been upgraded to capture carbon–nitrogen cycle interactions (e.g., (Le Quéré et al., 2018), many also include a representation of wildfire and fire–vegetation interactions (Rabin et al., 2017) and a small number now also account for land management (e.g., wood removal from forests and crop fertilisation harvest of irrigation (Arneth et al., 2017). Other forms of disturbance, such as tree mortality, in response to, for example, episodic weather extremes or insect pest outbreaks, are relatively poorly represented or not at all, although they demonstrably impact calculated carbon cycling (Pugh et al., 2019a). Simulated biome shifts are generally in agreement in projecting broad patterns on a global scale but vary greatly regarding the simulated trends in historical and future carbon uptake or losses, both regionally and globally (Chang et al., 2017; Canadell et al., 2021)."

Moreover, in the annual updates of the global carbon budgets, a model has to meet a small set of basic criteria to have its output included (Le Quéré et al., 2018). More systematic benchmarking approaches have also been proposed that utilise a range of different datasets (Kelley et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2017) to assess multiple simulated processes. These methods, in principle, facilitate assigning quality scores to models based on their overall performance (Kelley et al., 2013). So far, this scoring does not yet allow a clear quality ranking of models, since individual DGVMs tend to score well for some variables and badly for others. A recent comparison of global fire–vegetation model outputs was also able to clearly identify outliers when using a formalised benchmarking and scoring approach (Hantson et al., 2020). However, benchmarking does not address sources of uncertainty and it would be advisable to perform ‘perturbed-physics’ experiments, in which multiple model parameters are varied in parallel more frequently as a means to test parameter-value uncertainty (Wramneby et al., 2008; Booth et al., 2012; Lienert and Joos, 2018)."

Whether or not the enhanced integration of state, function and functional diversity across multiple trophic levels in models will markedly alter projections of how ecosystems respond to climate change thus remains an open research question."

However, they are not intended to provide a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem services. For these, other approaches applied but, to date, these are mostly applied on regional scales and are only weakly dynamic (Ferrier et al., 2016)."

Global vegetation and ESMs agree on climate change-driven shifts of biome boundaries of potentially hundreds of kilometres over this century, combined with several substantial alterations that take place within biomes (e.g., changes in phenology, canopy structure and functional diversity, etc.). Large discrepancies exist between models and between scenarios regarding the region and the speed of change (Gonzalez et al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2010; Pecl et al., 2017), but robust understanding is emerging in that the degree of impact increases in high-emission and high-warming scenarios (high confidence) (Figure 2.9)."

Many of these observations have already been projected to take place as early as at least IPCC AR3 (Rosenzweig et al., 2007), and can they now be increasingly tested for their robustness with observational evidence. These multiple changes in response to warming (and changes in precipitation and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels that go hand-in-hand with warming) are further expected for already relatively small additional temperature increases. In particular, in cold (boreal and tundra) regions, as well as in dry regions (high confidence), alterations of 2–47% of the areal extent of terrestrial ecosystems in scenarios of <2°C warming above pre-industrial levels have been projected, increasing drastically with higher-warming scenarios (Warren, 2011; Wårlind et al., 2014). More recent work, applying also probabilistic methods, confirm the risk of drastic changes in vegetation cover (e.g., forest to non-forest or vice versa) at the end of the 21st century even for approximately 2°C warming scenarios, especially in tundra, and also in tropical forest and savannah regions, with more subtle changes (within a given biome type) likely to occur in all regions (Ostberg et al., 2013; Ostberg et al., 2018). Model studies have found 5–20% of terrestrial ecosystems affected by warming of around 2°C–3°C, increasing to above one-third at a warming of 4°C–5°C (Ostberg et al., 2013; Warszawski et al., 2013)."

For instance, boreal or temperate forest vegetation is simulated to migrate polewards, closed tropical (moist) forest is expected to transition towards dry tropical forest types, while climate-driven degradation might expand arid vegetation cover (Sections 2.5.2.2–2.5.2.9). However, ‘novel ecosystems’, that is, communities with no current or historical equivalent because of the novel combinations of abiotic conditions under climate change, are expected to be increasingly common in the future (medium confidence), although the regions where these novel ecosystems might emerge are still disputed (Reu et al., 2014; Radeloff et al., 2015; Ordonez et al., 2016). The possibility of these novel ecosystems and the communities that live within them are a challenge for current modelling of ecosystem shifts, and new approaches to conservation will be required that are designed to adapt to rapid changes in species composition and the ensuing challenges."

Arid Mongolian steppe grassland did not respond to experimentally elevated CO2 (Song et al., 2019). Woody encroachment is projected to continue or not reverse in North American drylands (Caracciolo et al., 2016) and southern African arid ecosystems (Moncrieff et al., 2014b). Dryland woody encroachment may increase carbon stocks, depending on emissions scenario (Martens et al., 2021), but reduce soil water and biodiversity of grassland-dependent species diversity (Archer et al., 2017). Warm season (C4) grass expansion into arid shrublands risks sudden ecosystem transformation due to introduced wildfire (Bradley et al., 2016), a risk anticipated for grass-invaded desert ecosystems of Australia and the southwestern USA (Horn and St. Clair, 2017).

There is high confidence that observations of high mortality in trees and other growth forms, reduced reproductive and recruitment success, range shifts, community shifts towards more thermophilic species and type conversions are set to continue, due to either direct climate impacts through drought and other extreme weather events or to their interaction with factors like fire and pathogens (Sections 2.4.3.5, 2.4.3.6; 2.4.3.7; 2.4.4.2; 2.4.4.3; 2.5.2.5, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.2.7, 2.5.4)."

This will lead to the birth of novel fire regimes in MTEs, characterised by an increase in the probability of greater burned area and extreme wildfire events (e.g., megafires), with associated loss of human life and property, long-term impacts on ecosystems and acceleration of the possible loss of resilience and capacity to recover (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; González et al., 2018; Boer et al., 2020; Moreira et al., 2020; Nolan et al., 2020; Duane et al., 2021; Gallagher et al., 2021)."

Any increases in the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation are highly likely to compromise soil stability in recently burnt areas (Morán-Ordóñez et al., 2020). The impacts of fire often depend on interactions with non-climatic factors such as habitat fragmentation (Slingsby et al., 2020b) and management (Steel et al., 2015) or the spread of flammable exotic plantation forestry and invasive species (Kraaij et al., 2018; McWethy et al., 2018).

It has been shown that simulation studies that do not account for CO2 interactions but only consider climate change impacts do not realistically capture the future distribution of savannas (high confidence) (Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Moncrieff et al., 2016; Scheiter et al., 2020). Due to the continued strong effect of CO2 on tree and shrub-to-grass ratios in future, models suggest a loss of savanna extent and conversion into closed canopy forest/thicket and an expansion of savanna-type vegetation into arid grasslands (Wårlind et al., 2014; Moncrieff et al., 2016). In arid savannas and their interface to grasslands, survival of woody vegetation (which may be stimulated to grow by increasing CO2) will depend on their capacity to survive potentially more severe and frequent droughts (Sankaran and Staver, 2019). Across a range of models, for RCP4.5 future climate change and CO2 concentrations, savanna expanse declines by around 50% (converting to closed canopy systems) by 2070 in Africa and South America, 25% in Asia and with small changes in Australia (Moncrieff et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2021).

In fact, indirect climate change impacts arising from mitigation efforts may be particularly perilous to savannas; extensive tree-planting to restore ecosystems and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, as pledged, for example, under the African Forest Restoration Initiative, could lead to carbon losses and the loss of biodiversity as well as damage the water balance if trees are planted on what was naturally grassland or savanna (Box 2.2; FAQ 2.6) (Bond et al., 2019)."

An increase of 8% in the area of rubber plantations in Yunnan Province, China, between 2002–2010 to higher altitudes due to decreased environmental limits, has potentially increased pressure on the remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas (Zomer et al., 2014a). As a consequence, the suitable area for mammals is projected to be reduced by 47.7% (RCP2.6) and 67.7% (RCP8.5) by 2070, with large variability depending on the different species (Cross-Chapter Paper 7) (Brodie, 2016). To minimize these potential threats, the Yunnan provincial government has identified suitable areas for the establishment of national parks, including the Asian Elephant National Park since 2006. And the government of China developed a national park system in 2013 across the country."
wg2_ch02_2.5.2.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"As in the Arctic, warming substantially exceeding the global average has already been observed in the northern parts of the temperate and boreal forest zone (Gauthier et al., 2015), and is projected to continue (see  Cross-Chapter Paper 6 and (Lee et al., 2021)). As a consequence, boreal tree species are expected to move northwards (or in mountainous regions, upwards) into regions dominated by tundra, unless constrained by edaphic features, and temperate species are projected to grow in regions currently occupied by southern boreal forest (high confidence). In both biomes, deciduous trees are simulated to grow increasingly in regions currently dominated by conifers (Wårlind et al., 2014; Boulanger et al., 2017). These simulation results have been supported by observational examples. In eastern Siberia, fire disturbance of larch-dominated forest was followed by recovery to birch-dominated forest (Stuenzi and Schaepman-Strub, 2020). In Alberta, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) lost its dominant status after attacks by mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) caused the canopy to switch to non-pine conifers and broadleaf trees (Axelson et al., 2018). In contrast to the examples above, some boreal forests have proven resilient to disturbances including recent unprecedented insect outbreaks (Campbell et al., 2019a; Prendin et al., 2020)."

Interactions between permafrost and vegetation are important. For example, trees in the east Siberian taiga obtained water mostly from rain in wet summers and permafrost melt water in dry summers (Sugimoto et al., 2002), suggesting that these forests will be particularly vulnerable to the combination of drought with the retraction of permafrost further underground due to climate warming."
wg2_ch02_2.5.2.8 _p1,NO_TITLE,"The overall effect of climate change on the extent of northern peatlands is still debated (limited evidence, low agreement ). It is expected that climate change will drive the expansion of high-latitude peatlands poleward of their present distribution due to warming, permafrost degradation and glacier retreat, which could provide new land and conditions favourable for peat development (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Zhang et al., 2017b), as seen during the last de-glacial warming (robust evidence, high agreement ) (MacDonald et al., 2006; Jones and Yu, 2010; Ratcliffe et al., 2018). Peatland area loss (shrinking) near the southern limit of their current distribution or in areas where the climate becomes unsuitable is also expected (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Section 2.3.4.3.2) (Finkelstein and Cowling, 2011 Gallego-Sala and Prentice, 2013; Schneider et al., 2016; Müller and Joos, 2020) (Müller and Joos, 2021), but they could persist if moisture is maintained via their capacity to self-regulate. In western Canada, a study suggests that peatlands may persist until 2100, even though the climate will be less suitable (Schneider et al., 2016). Simulations suggest that climate change-driven increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 could drive reductions in the northern peatland area up to 18% (SSP1–2.6), 41% (SSP2–4.5) and 61% (SSP5–8.5) by 2300 (Müller and Joos, 2020). This is in contrast with the findings of northern peatland persistence and expansion under RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 scenarios in 1861–2099 by another modelling study (Qiu et al., 2020). In the Tropics, the only available study suggests peatland area will increase until 2300, mainly due to increases in precipitation and the CO2 fertilisation effect (Müller and Joos, 2020; Müller and Joos, 2021)."

It is expected that the carbon balance of peatlands globally will switch from sink to source in the near future (2020–2100), mainly because tropical peatland emissions, together with those from climate change-driven permafrost thaw, will likely surpass the carbon gain expected from climate change-driven enhanced plant productivity in northern high latitudes (Gallego-Sala et al., 2018; Chaudhary et al., 2020; Turetsky et al., 2020; Loisel et al., 2021) which are mainly caused by groundwater drawdown (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Hirano et al., 2014; Brouns et al., 2015; Cobb et al., 2017; Itoh et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2021).

For example, drought has been linked to fires in Southeast Asian peatlands (Field et al., 2009) and there are predicted decreases in mean summer precipitation (10–30%) for high and low RCPs, particularly over the Indonesian region, by the mid and late 21st century (Section 12.4.2.2) (Tangang et al., 2020; Taufik et al., 2020). During wet years, the fire probability in Indonesian peatlands also significantly increases (by 15–40%) when temperatures in July to October surpass 0.5°C anomalies compared to the 1995–2015 baseline (Fernandes et al., 2017).

Climate models project that warming of the Arctic is likely to continue at more than double the global rate. Compared to the period 1995–2014, mean annual surface air temperatures in the Arctic tundra are projected to increase by 7.9°C–10°C by the end of the century in scenarios of high GHG emissions (RCP7.0 and RCP8.5). In scenarios of low GHG emissions (RCP1.9 and RCP2.6), the projected increase is 2.6°C–3.2°C (Lee et al., 2021). The Arctic is also projected to have amongst the largest increases in precipitation globally, but with high uncertainty. In contrast to climate change, LUC is projected to be very low in Arctic tundra systems (van Asselen and Verburg, 2013)."

Simulating changes in tundra vegetation is complicated by permafrost dynamics (e.g., the formation of thaw ponds and draining of existing ponds), changes in precipitation and low nutrient availability (which may promote the abundance of graminoids) (van der Kolk et al., 2016). Changes in vegetation, when combined with warming and increased precipitation effects on soil thawing and carbon cycling, are projected to modify GHG emissions and have biophysical feedbacks to regional and global climate. High uncertainty in modelled carbon cycle changes arises from differences between the vegetation models (Nishina et al., 2015; Ito et al., 2016). In addition, climate change is expected to strongly interact with other factors, such as fire, to further increase uncertainty in projections of tundra ecosystem function (Jiang et al., 2017)."

wg2_ch02_2.5.2.10_p2,NO_TITLE,"However, there is an increasing body of literature that has found continued, longer-term responses of ecosystems to climate change, so-called ‘committed changes’, that arise from lags that exist in many systems. Many processes in ecosystems take more than a few decades to quasi-equilibrate to environmental changes. Therefore, the trends of changing vegetation cover identified in simulations of transient warming continue to show up in simulations that hold climate change at low levels of warming (medium confidence) (Boulton et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Scheiter et al., 2020). Such changes, which could tip ecosystems into an alternative state, could also be triggered by a ‘warming overshoot’ if global warming were to exceed a certain threshold, even if mean temperatures afterwards decline again (Albrich et al., 2020a)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.2.10_p3,NO_TITLE,"For instance, even if warming achieved by 2100 remained constant after 2100, such committed responses continue to occur. These include: (1) continued Amazon forest loss (Boulton et al., 2017), consistent with results in Pugh et al. (2018) that found continued tropical forest cover loss across a range of models and simulation setups, and (2) across Africa, an increased shift towards woody C3 vegetation was found in equilibrium state, the overall response depending on the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Scheiter et al., 2020). In Pugh et al. (2018), the opposite was found for boreal forest cover, which showed a strong committed increase. The committed changes in vegetation composition correspond to large committed changes in terrestrial carbon uptake and losses (Boulton et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Scheiter et al., 2020), and would plausibly also appear in other ecosystem functioning and services. These studies point to the importance of having not only a multi-decadal but also a multi-century perspective when exploring the impacts of political decisions on climate change mitigation taken now. Even if climate-warming targets are met, published evidence so far suggests that fundamental changes in some ecosystems are likely  as these correspond to well-understood ecosystem physiological responses that trigger long-term changes in composition."

We use this to assess how well the projections are matching up with observed changes. The map represents studies documenting observed changes in common plant functional groups (e.g., trees, grasses and shrubs). Studies documenting changes in plant functional groups were collated from published papers in natural and semi-natural areas. Studies were included if climate change or interactions between climate change and land use showed a causal link to the observed change (Table SM2.4). Studies were excluded if the changes were only from landscape/land use transformation (e.g., deforestation). In each paper, we recorded the geographical location and type of functional change, and noted the causes. Observed changes are plotted onto a biome map derived from the WWF ecoregions database (Olson et al., 2001).

In California, climate change under a scenario of a 4°C temperature increase could double fire frequency in some areas (Mann et al., 2016), but emission reductions that limit the temperature increase to ~2°C could keep this from increasing (Westerling et al., 2011). Carbon dioxide fertilisation and increased temperature under climate change could increase invasive grasses and wildfire in desert ecosystems of the southwestern USA where wildfire has historically been absent or infrequent, and increase the mortality of the sparse tree cover (Horn and St. Clair, 2017; Klinger and Brooks, 2017; Syphard et al., 2017; Moloney et al., 2019; Sweet et al., 2019)."

Loss of boreal and temperate forest to fire, wind and bark beetles could cause more negative than positive effects for most ecosystem services, including carbon storage to regulate climate change (Sections 2.4.4.3, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.2.7, 2.5.3.4), water supply for people (Section 2.5.3.6.1), timber production and other forest products (Chapter 5) and protection from hazards (Thom and Seidl, 2016).

Under RCP8.5, half the Amazon tropical evergreen forest could turn into grassland through drought-induced tree mortality and wildfire, but lower emissions (RCP4.5) could limit this loss to ~5% (Lyra et al., 2016). The decline in precipitation due to reduced evapotranspiration inputs after forest loss could cause additional Amazon forest loss of one-quarter to one-third (Zemp et al., 2017a).

In the western USA, under RCP8.5, one-tenth of forest area is highly vulnerable to drought-induced mortality by 2050 (Buotte et al., 2019).

In Alaska, fire-induced tree mortality from climate change under RCP8.5 could reduce the extent of spruce forest (Picea sp.) by 8–44% by 2100 (Pastick et al., 2017). Under RCP8.5, tree mortality from drought, wildfire and bark beetles could reduce the timber productivity of boreal forests in Canada by 2100 below the current levels (Boucher et al., 2018; Chaste et al., 2019; Brecka et al., 2020). In Tasmania, projected increases in wildfire (Fox-Hughes et al., 2014) increase the risk of mortality of mesic vegetation (Harris et al., 2018b) and threaten the disappearance of the long-lived endemic pencil pine (Athrotaxis cupressoides) (Holz et al., 2015; Worth et al., 2016) and temperate montane rainforest (Mariani et al., 2019).

Peatlands, permafrost regions and tropical ecosystems are particularly vulnerable due to their large carbon stocks, in combination with over-proportional warming, increases in heat waves and droughts and/or a complex interplay of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 (Sections 2.5.2.8, 2.5.2.9, 2.5.3.2)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Model projections suggest a reduction of permafrost extent and potentially large carbon losses for all warming scenarios (Canadell et al., 2021). Already a mean temperature increase of 2°C could reduce the total permafrost area extent by about 5–20% by 2100 (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020). Associated CO2 losses in the order of 15 Gt up to nearly 70 Gt by 2100 have been projected across a number of modelling studies (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Comyn-Platt et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020). Limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C versus 2°C could reduce projected permafrost CO2 losses by 2100 by 24.2 Gt (median, calculated for a 3-m depth) (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). Losses are possibly underestimated in the studies that consider only the upper permafrost layers. Likewise, the actual committed carbon loss may well be larger (e.g., eventually a loss of approx. 40% of today’s permafrost area extent if climate is stabilised at 2°C above pre-industrial levels) due to the long time scale of warming in deep permafrost layers (Chadburn et al., 2017). It is not known at which level of global warming an abrupt permafrost collapse (estimated to enhance CO2 emissions by 40% in 2300 in a high-emissions scenario) compared to gradual thaw (Turetsky et al., 2020) would have to be considered an important additional risk. Large uncertainties arise also from interactions with changes in surface hydrology and/or northward migrating woody vegetation as climate warms, which could dampen or even reverse projected net carbon losses in some regions (McGuire et al., 2018a; Mekonnen et al., 2018; Pugh et al., 2018). Overall, there is low confidence on how carbon–permafrost interactions will affect future carbon cycle and climate, although net carbon losses and thus positive (amplifying) feedbacks are likely  (Sections 2.5.2.10, 2.5.3.5) (Shukla et al., 2019).

For both northern mid- and high-latitude and tropical peatlands, a shift from contemporary CO2 sinks to sources were simulated in high-warming scenarios (Wang et al., 2018a; Qiu et al., 2020). Due to the lack of large-scale modelling studies, there is low confidence for climate change impacts on peat carbon uptake and emissions. The largest risk to tropical peatlands is expected to arise from drainage and conversion to forestry or agriculture, which would outpace the impacts of climate change (Page and Baird, 2016; Leifeld et al., 2019; Cooper et al., 2020). The magnitude of possible carbon losses is uncertain, however, and depends strongly on socioeconomic scenarios (Sections 2.4.3.8, 2.4.4.2; 2.4.4.4.2, 2.5.2.8)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"For tropical and subtropical regions, the interplay of atmospheric CO2 with precipitation and temperature becomes of particular importance for future carbon uptake, since in warm and dry environments, elevated CO2 fosters plants with C3 photosynthesis and enhances their water-use efficiency relative to C4 species (Moncrieff et al., 2014a; Midgley and Bond, 2015; Knorr et al., 2016a). As a consequence, enhanced woody cover is expected to occur in the future, especially in mesic savannas, while in xeric savannas an increase in woody cover would occur in regions with enhanced precipitation (Criado et al., 2020). Even though semiarid regions have dominated the global trend in land CO2 uptake in recent decades (Ahlström et al., 2015), so far, most studies that investigated future climate change impacts on savanna ecosystems have concentrated on changes in the extent of land area affected (2.5.2.5) rather than on carbon cycling, with medium confidence for increasing woody cover:grass ratios (Moncrieff et al., 2014a; Midgley and Bond, 2015; Moncrieff et al., 2016; Criado et al., 2020). Increases in woody vegetation in what is now grass-dominated would possibly come with a carbon benefit, for instance, it was found that a broad range of future climate and CO2 changes would enhance vegetation carbon storage on Australian savannas (Scheiter et al., 2015). Results from a number of field experiments indicate, however, that impacts on total ecosystem carbon storage may be smaller due to a loss in below-ground carbon (Coetsee et al., 2013; Wigley et al., 2020). Nunez et al. (2021) critique existing incentives to promote the invasion of non-native trees into treeless areas as a means of carbon sequestration, raising doubts about the effects on fire, albedo, biodiversity and water yield (see Box 2.2)."

Accordingly, models also suggest a continuation of tropical forests acting as carbon sinks (Huntingford et al., 2013; Mercado et al., 2018). A recent study combining field plot data with statistical models (Hubau et al., 2020) indicates that, in the Amazonian and possibly also in the African forest, the carbon sink in above-ground biomass already declined in the three decades up to 2015. This trend is distinct in the Amazon whereas data from Africa suggests a possible decline after 2010. The authors estimate the vegetation carbon sink in 2030–2040 to decline to zero±0.205 PgC yr -1 in the Amazon and to 0.26±0.215 PgC yr -1 in Africa (a loss of 14% compared to the present). Their results suggest that, over time, CO2 fertilisation is outweighed by the impacts of higher temperatures and drought that enhance tree mortality and diminish growth. The degree of thermal resilience of tropical forests is still uncertain, however (Sullivan et al., 2020)."

Similar to tropical peatlands, given projected human population growth and socioeconomic changes, the continued conversion of forests and savannas into agricultural or pasture systems very likely  poses a significant risk of rapid carbon loss which will amplify the climate change-induced risks substantially (high confidence) (2.5.2.10, 2.5.3.5) (Aragao et al., 2014; Searchinger et al., 2015; Aleman et al., 2016; Nobre et al., 2016)."

Across different field experiments, the ecosystem consequences of the presence or absence of herbivores and carnivores have been found to be quantitatively as large as the effects of other environmental change drivers such as warming, enhanced CO2, fire and variable nitrogen deposition (medium confidence) (Hooper et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2015). Some local and regional modelling experiments have begun to explore animal impacts on vegetation dynamics and carbon and nutrient cycling (Pachzelt et al., 2015; Dangal et al., 2017; Berzaghi et al., 2019). Turnover rate is the chief factor that determines future land-ecosystem carbon dynamics and hence carbon–climate feedbacks (Friend et al., 2014).

It is virtually certain that land surface change caused by disturbances such as forest fires, hurricanes, phenological changes, insect outbreaks and deforestation affect carbon, water and energy exchanges, thereby influencing weather and climate (very high confidence) (Table 2.4; Figure 2.10) (Bright et al., 2013; Brovkin et al., 2013; Naudts et al., 2016; Prăvălie, 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Feedbacks can be positive or negative (i.e., amplify or dampen the original forcing), vary spatially and seasonally, and act over large geographic areas and long time periods (more than decades), making them difficult to observe and quantify directly (Schimel et al., 2015; Canadell et al., 2021). Due to the positive impacts of CO2 on vegetation growth and ecosystem carbon storage (high confidenc e) (Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.5.4) (Canadell et al., 2021), the associated climate feedback is negative (i.e., increased removal of atmospheric CO2 and dampened warming, compared to an absence of the feedback). By contrast, projected global losses of carbon in warmer climates (Canadell et al., 2021) imply a positive climate feedback. WGI (Canadell et al., 2021) assesses an overall increase in land carbon uptake through the 21st century. However, the overall strength of the carbon cycle–climate feedback remains very uncertain. One of the underlying reasons may be complex interactions with ecosystem water balance and nitrogen and phosphorous availability, which are poorly constrained by observational evidence and incompletely captured in ESMs (Section 2.5.2.10) (Huntzinger et al., 2017; Canadell et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Land ecosystems contribute substantially to global emissions of nitrous oxide and methane . As with CO2, these emissions respond both directly and indirectly to atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change, and this gives rise to potential additional bio-geochemical feedbacks in the climate system. A large part of these emissions stem from land and water management, such as fertilizer application, rice production, aquaculture or animal husbandry (Jia et al., 2019). However, nearly 60% of total nitrous oxide emissions (in 2007–2016) has been estimated to stem from natural ecosystems, especially in the Tropics (Tian et al., 2019; Canadell et al., 2021), while freshwater wetlands and peatlands are estimated to contribute between 83% (top-down estimates) and 40% (bottom-up estimates) of total natural CH4 (and 31 and 20% of total methane emissions, respectively) for the period 2008–2017 (Canadell et al., 2021). Median CH4 emissions from northern-latitude wetlands in 2100 were estimated to be 12.1 and 13.5 PgC in emission scenarios leading to 1.5°C and 2°C warming, respectively (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). Likewise, global warming has been attributed to soil N2O emission increases since the pre-industrial period of 0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr -1 (Tian et al., 2020). Overall, climate feedbacks from future altered land ecosystem emissions of CH4 or N2O are uncertain, but are expected to be small (Canadell et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Changes in regional biodiversity are integral parts of ecosystem–climate feedback loops, including and beyond carbon cycle processes (Figure 2.10; Table 2.4). For instance, the impacts of climate-induced altered animal composition and trophic cascades on ecosystem carbon turnover (see Sections 2.4.4.4, 2.5.3.4) could be a substantive contribution to carbon–climate feedbacks (low confidence). Additional surface–atmosphere feedbacks that arise from changes in vegetation cover and subsequently altered albedo, evapotranspiration or roughness (often summarised as biophysical feedbacks) can be regionally relevant and could amplify or dampen vegetation cover changes (Jia et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"Climate-induced shifts towards forests in what is currently tundra would be expected to reduce regional albedo especially in spring, but also during parts of winter when trees are snow-free (whereas tundra vegetation would be covered in snow), which amplifies warming regionally (high confidence) (Perugini et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019). Trees would also enhance momentum absorption compared to low tundra vegetation, thus impacting surface–atmosphere mixing of latent and sensible heat fluxes (Jia et al., 2019). Boreal forests insulate and stabilize permafrost and reduce fluctuations of ground temperature: the amplitude of variation of ground surface temperatures was 28°C at a forested site, compared to 60°C in nearby grassland (Section 2.5.2.7) (Bonan, 1989; Stuenzi et al., 2021a; Stuenzi et al., 2021b). Likewise, a shift in moist tropical forests towards vegetation with drought-tolerant traits could possibly reduce evapotranspiration, increase albedo, alter heat transfer at the surface and lead to a negative feedback to precipitation (Section 2.5.2.6) (Jia et al., 2019). In savannas, restoration of woody vegetation has been shown to enhance cloud formation and precipitation in response to enhanced transpiration and turbulent mixing, leading to a positive feedback on woody cover (Syktus and McAlpine, 2016). While this has not yet been systematically explored, similar feedbacks might also emerge from a CO2-induced woody cover increase in savannas (low confidence) (Section 2.5.2.5)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Since biophysical feedbacks can contribute to both surface temperature warming or cooling, analyses so far suggest that, on a global scale, the net impact on climate change is small (Perugini et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019), unless these feedbacks also accelerate vegetation mortality and lead to substantive carbon losses (Zemp et al., 2017a; Lemordant and Gentine, 2019). More than one-third of the Earth’s land surface has at least 50% of its evapotranspiration regulated by vegetation, and in some regions between 40 and >80% of the land’s evaporated water is returned to land as precipitation. Locally, both directly human-mediated and climate change-mediated changes in vegetation cover can therefore notably affect annual average freshwater availability to human societies, especially if negative feedbacks amplify the reduction of vegetation cover, evapotranspiration and precipitation (medium confidence) (Keys et al., 2016; Keys and Wang-Erlandsson, 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, freshwater ecosystems (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and ponds) have been increasingly recognised as important sources of GHG emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) into the atmosphere. Key mechanisms which contribute to rising GHG emissions from freshwater ecosystems are the temperature imbalance between photosynthesis and respiration (respiration increases more than photosynthesis with rising temperature), CO2 and CH4 emissions from exposed sediments during droughts, increased transport of matter from land to water, changes in water retention time in rivers and lakes and the effects of temperature on lake stratification and anoxia that favour CH4 emissions."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p9,NO_TITLE,"DelSontro et al. (2018) assembled the largest global data set to date on emission rates from lakes of CO2, CH4 and N2O and found that they co-vary with lake size and trophic state. They estimated that moderate global increases in eutrophication of lakes could translate to 5–40% increases in the GHG effect in the atmosphere. Moreover, they estimated that GHG emissions from lakes and impoundments in past decades accounted for 1.25–2.30 PgCO2 yr -1 (DelSontro et al., 2018), thus around 20% of global CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (9.4 PgCO2 yr -1) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p10,NO_TITLE,"Global warming will strongly enhance freshwater CH4 emissions through a disproportionate increase in ebullition (gas flux) by 6–20% per 1°C increase in water temperature (Aben et al., 2017). It can be expected that ongoing eutrophication enhanced by climate change-related increases in the release of sediment nutrients and the loading of organic carbon and nutrients from catchments will enhance CH4 ebullition on a global scale (Aben et al., 2017; DelSontro et al., 2018; Bartosiewicz et al., 2019; Beaulieu et al., 2019; Sanches et al., 2019). The strongest increase in ebullition is expected in shallow waters where sediment temperatures are strongly related to atmospheric temperature (Aben et al., 2017). Given that small ponds and shallow lakes are the most abundant freshwater ecosystems globally, these may become hot spots of CH4 ebullition in the future (Aben et al., 2017). On average, CH4, CO2 and N2O account for 75, 23 and 2% of the total CO2-equivalent emissions, respectively, in lakes (DelSontro et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p11,NO_TITLE,"Furthermore, the exposure of lake and river sediments during droughts activates the decomposition of buried organic carbon. In dry river beds, mineralisation of buried organic matter is likely to increase with climate change as anoxic sediments are oxygenated downwards during drying, along with pulses of microbial activity following re-wetting of desiccated sediment. Conservative estimates indicate that adding emissions from exposed sediments of dry inland waters across diverse ecosystem types and climate zones to current global estimates of CO2 emissions could result in a 6% (~0.12 PgC yr −1) increase of total inland water CO2 emission rates covering streams and rivers (334 mmol m -2 day -1), lakes and reservoirs (320 mmol m -2 day -1) and small ponds (148 mmol m -2 day -1) (Marcé et al., 2019; Keller et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p12,NO_TITLE,"Overall, uncertainty as to the quantity of carbon fluxes within freshwater ecosystems and between terrestrial and freshwater systems, and subsequent emissions to the atmosphere remains very high (Raymond et al., 2013; Catalán et al., 2016; Stanley et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2017; Drake et al., 2018; Seekell et al., 2018; Sanches et al., 2019; Bodmer et al., 2020; Keller et al., 2020; Canadell et al., 2021) (see Table SM2.1.). Projections of carbon fluxes are, for example, challenged by the complex interaction between rising water temperatures, loss of ice, changes in hydrology, ecosystem productivity, increased extreme events and variation in terrestrial-matter transport. While we are still short of empirical data, particularly in the Tropics (DelSontro et al., 2018), improvements in sensor technology (Eugster et al., 2011; Gonzalez-Valencia et al., 2014; Maeck et al., 2014; Delwiche et al., 2015) and the use of statistically robust survey designs (Beaulieu et al., 2016; Wik et al., 2016) have improved the accuracy of measurements of GHG emissions in freshwater ecosystems. Global networks such as the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) increasingly allow a global view of carbon fluxes, thereby improving estimates of the contribution of freshwater ecosystems to global GHG emissions to the atmosphere."
wg2_ch02_2.5.3.5_p13,NO_TITLE,"In summary for freshwater systems, Drake et al. (2018) aggregated contemporary estimates of CO2 and CH4 emissions from freshwater ecosystems with global estimates made by Raymond et al. (2013), and arrived at an estimate of 3.9 PgC yr -1. Rivers and streams accounted for 85% and lakes and reservoirs for 15% of the emissions (Raymond et al., 2013). This trend will continue under scenarios of nutrient loading to inland waters over the next century where increased CH4 emission of inland water has an atmospheric impact of 1.7–2.6 PgC/CO2-eq y −1, which is equivalent to 18–33% of annual CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Beaulieu et al., 2019). For comparison, annual uptake of CO2 in land ecosystems is estimated as 3.4 (± 0.9) PgC yr −1 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). The freshwater numbers combine CO2 and CH4 and are thus not directly comparable. However, they are indicative of the importance of better accounting for freshwater systems in global carbon budgets."

Under current conditions, nearly half the global land area is at a moderate-to-high risk of water scarcity due to wildfires (Robinne et al., 2018; Robinne et al., 2020). From 1984 to 2014, wildfires in the western USA affected 6–11% of stream and river length (Ball et al., 2021). Under a high-emissions scenario of a 3.5°C temperature increase, post-fire erosion across the western USA could double sedimentation and degrade drinking water quality in one-third of watersheds by 2050 (Sankey et al., 2017). In Brazil, post-fire vegetation loss tends to increase runoff, reduce infiltration and reduce groundwater recharge and flow of springs (Rodrigues et al., 2019). Runoff from wildfires can contain DOC precursors for the formation of carcinogenic trihalomethanes during chlorination of water for drinking (Uzun et al., 2020) as well as chromium, mercury, selenium and other toxic trace metals (Burton et al., 2016; Burton et al., 2019)."

The AR5 chapter on terrestrial ecosystems (Settele et al., 2014) had also identified three of these key risks—species extinctions, tree mortality and ecosystem carbon losses—and a fourth—invasion by non-native species. This chapter assesses, in multiple sections, the impacts of climate change on invasive species with respect to different processes or systems (e.g., in Section 2.4.2.3.3), and includes this aspect here in a new broader key risk of ecosystem structure change. The AR5 included wildfire as a mechanism of the key risk of ecosystem carbon loss. Based on additional research and field experience with major wildfires since then, this chapter sets wildfire apart as a specific key risk to ecosystem integrity and human well-being. These different measures of risk are interconnected, but approach the assessment of the risks to terrestrial and freshwater ecosytems from different angles, using complementary metrics."
wg2_ch02_2.5.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Species are the fundamental unit of ecosystems. As species become rare, their roles in the functioning of the ecosystem diminishes and disappears altogether if they become locally extinct (high confidence) (Isbell et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018b; van der Plas, 2019; Wang et al., 2021b). Loss of species and functional groups reduces the ability of an ecosystem to provide services, and lowers its resilience to climate change (high confidence) (Section 2.6.7) (Elmqvist et al., 2003; Cadotte et al., 2011; Harrison et al., 2014; Carlucci et al., 2020). For example, among crop systems, a key factor to succesful pollination is the phylogenetic diversity of bee species available, more than total abundances (Drossart and Gérard, 2020). Because many species have obligate interactions with, or are resources for, other species (e.g., predators and their prey, insects and their host plants, plants and their mycorrhizae symbionts), the loss of one species affects the risk to another species, and, ultimately, ecosystem functioning (Mahoney and Bishop, 2017)"
wg2_ch02_2.5.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Global rates of species extinction are accelerating dramatically (Barnosky et al., 2011), with approximately 10% of species having been driven extinct by humans since the late Pleistocene, principally by overexploitation and habitat destruction, a rate estimated to be 1000 times higher than pre-Anthropocene (natural) background extinction rates (De Vos et al., 2015). Therefore, this level—10%—of species becoming “endangered” (sensu IUCN),and therefore at high risk of extinction, due to the loss of suitable climate space (Figure 2.8b), is used here as a threshold, moving the risk to biodiversity from moderate to high, and twice that (20%) as the threshold from high to very high."
wg2_ch02_2.5.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Key risks assessed here are interconnected. Extinction of species is an irreversible impact of climate change and has negative consequences on ecosystem integrity and functioning, and the risks increase steeply with even small rises in global temperature  (Section 2.5.1.3, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.7, Figure 2.8). Continued climate change substantially increases the risk of carbon losses due to wildfires, tree mortality from drought and insect pest outbreaks, peatland drying, permafrost thaw and changes in the structure of ecosystems; these could exacerbate self-reinforcing feedbacks between emissions from high-carbon ecosystems and increasing global temperatures (medium confidence). Thawing of Arctic permafrost alone could release 11–200 GtC (medium confidence). Complex interactions of climate changes, LULCC, carbon dioxide fluxes and vegetation changes will regulate the future carbon balance of the biosphere, processes incompletely represented in ESMs. The exact timing and magnitude of climate–biosphere feedbacks and the potential tipping points of carbon loss are characterised by broad ranges of the estimates, but studies indicate that increased ecosystem carbon losses could cause extreme future temperature increases (medium confidence). (Sections 2.5.2.7, 2.5.2.8, 2.5.2.9, 2.5.3.2, 2.5.3.3, 2.5.3.4, 2.5.3.5, Figure 2.10, Figure 2.11, Table 2.4, Table 2.5, Table SM2.2, Table SM2.5)"

This IPCC chapter assesses these as the most fundamental risks of climate change to ecosystem integrity and the ecosystem services that support human well-being. Climate factors include the primary variables governing the risk. Non-climate factors include other phenomena that can dominate or contribute to the risk. Detection and attribution comprise cases of observed changes attributed predominantly, or in part, to climate change, with some cases being attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Sections 2.4.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, Table 2.2, Table 2.3, Table SM2.1). Adaptation includes options to address the risk (Section 2.6). Risk transitions (defined in Figure 2.11) indicate an approximate GSAT increase, relative to the pre-industrial period (1850–1900), to move from one level of risk to the other as well as assessed confidence. Table SM2.5 provides details of the temperature levels for risk transitions. Both tables provides details for the key risk burning embers diagram (Figure 2.11)."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Human health and well-being are highly dependent on the ‘health’ of nature. Biodiversity—the variety of genes, species, communities and ecosystems—provides services that are essential for human health and productive livelihoods, such as breathable air, drinkable water, productive oceans and fertile soils for growing food and fuels. Natural ecosystems also help store carbon and regulate climate, floods, disease, pollution and water quality. The loss of species, leading to reduced biodiversity, has direct and measurable negative effects on all of these essential services, and therefore on humankind. A recent demonstration of this is the decline of pollinator species, with potential negative effects on crop pollination, a fundamental ecosystem function crucial for agriculture. The loss of wild relatives of the domesticated varieties that humans rely on for agriculture reduces the genetic variability that may be needed to support the adaptation of crops to future environmental and social challenges."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The number of species that can be lost before negative impacts occur is not known and is likely to differ in different systems. However, in general, more diverse systems are more resilient to disturbances and able to recover from extreme events more quickly. Biodiversity loss means there are fewer connections within an ecosystem. A simpler food web with fewer interactions means less redundancy in the system, reducing the stability and ability of plants and animal communities to recover from disturbances and extreme weather events such as floods and drought."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"In addition to ‘material’ and economic services such as eco-tourism, nature also provides cultural services such as recreation, spirituality and well-being. Specifically, being in ‘direct contact with natural environments’ (vs. an urban environment) has a high positive impact on human well-being (e.g., mood, happiness), psychological and physical health (energy, vitality, heart rate, depression) and socio-cognitive abilities (attention, memory, hyperactivity, altruism, cooperation). Therefore, the loss of species from climate change and urbanisation will reduce natural spaces, decrease biodiversity, and, in turn, decrease human well-being and health worldwide."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Finally, the extent to which humans consider themselves part of the natural world—known as human-nature connectedness—has been demonstrated to be closely associated with human health and well-being. Individuals who are more connected to nature are not only happier and healthier but also tend to engage more in pro-nature behaviours, making the enhancement of human–nature connectedness worldwide a valuable win–win solution for humans and nature to face environmental challenges."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and their services to climate change has been addressed in previous IPCC reports, with AR4 and AR5 recognising both autonomous adaptation and human-assisted adaptation to protect natural species and ecosystems. In AR5, Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), adaptation for people, based on the better protection, restoration and management of the natural environment, was identified as an area of emerging opportunity, with a dedicated Cross-Chapter Box on the topic. In the SRCCL, conservation, EbA and related concepts were integrated throughout; SR1.5 also noted the role of EbA. Since the last assessment report, the scientific literature has expanded considerably, with growing interest in the concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS). This section assesses this new literature and its implications for the implementation of climate change adaptation."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Previous sections of this chapter have set out the vulnerability of natural and semi-natural ecosystems to climate change, and the risks this poses to both biodiversity and ecosystem services (also sometimes described as ‘Nature’s Contributions to People’). Natural systems respond to climatic and other environmental changes in a variety of ways. Individual organisms can respond through growth, movement and developmental processes. Species and populations genetically adapt to changing conditions and evolve over successive generations. Geomorphological features, such as the path of watercourses, can also change naturally in response to climate change. However, there is a limit to which these natural processes can maintain biodiversity and the benefits people derive from nature, partly due to intrinsic limits, but also because of the pressures that people exert on the natural environment."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p3,NO_TITLE,"Most of this section therefore focusses on human interventions to build the resilience of ecosystems, enable species to survive or to adjust management to climate change. Vulnerability is, in many cases, exacerbated by the degraded state of many ecosystems as a result of human exploitation and LUC, leading to the fragmentation of habitats, the loss of species and impaired ecosystem function. This interaction between climate change and environmental degradation means that protecting ecosystems in a natural or near-natural state will be an important pre-requisite for maintaining resilience and give many species the best chance of persisting in a changed climate (Belote et al., 2017; Arneth et al., 2020; Ferrier et al., 2020; França et al., 2020). Protection from degradation, deforestation and exploitation is also essential to maintain critical ecosystem services, including carbon storage and sequestration and water supply (Dinerstein et al., 2020; Pörtner et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p4,NO_TITLE,"It is worth briefly considering some key concepts that are relevant to adaptation in ecosystems. Adaptation for biodiversity and ecosystems can encompass both managing change and building resilience. We use the definition of ‘resilience’ set out Chapter 1: ‘the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation’. This includes the concept of ‘resistance’, which is used in some ecological literature to distinguish systems which are resistant to change from those that recover quickly from change. We consider both interventions designed primarily to protect biodiversity and those intended to reduce the risks of climate change to people."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p5,NO_TITLE,"A variety of terms are used to describe using environmental management to reduce the impacts of climate change on people in ways that also benefit biodiversity in the scientific literature, particularly EbA and NbS (see also Section 1.4). EbA is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to climate change (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). EbA aims to maintain and increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and people in the face of the adverse effects of climate change (Vignola et al., 2009). NbS is a broader term which is not restricted to climate change, and is also often used to refer to climate change mitigation; it has been defined by the IUCN as ‘Actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits’ (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016). This widely accepted definition excludes actions which use the natural environment to solve human problems but do not provide benefits for biodiversity, and is closely linked to the concept of the Ecosystem Approach. NbS is not a universally accepted term, but it is being increasingly used in the scientific literature. It is a concept which recognises the importance of biodiversity in ecosystem service provision, and offers the opportunity to address climate change and loss of biodiversity together in an efficient integrated way (Chong, 2014; Seddon et al., 2020a; Ortiz et al., 2021). Given that the focus of this chapter is on adaptation, we primarily use the term EbA as it is more specific, but we do so understanding that it can be regarded as a subset of NbS. The wider concept of NbS for climate change adaptation and mitigation is covered in a cross-chapter box on the topic (see Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter)."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p6,NO_TITLE,"Whilst we distinguish between adaptation for biodiversity and EbA, it is important to recognise that the two are linked in that, if ecosystems themselves are not resilient to climate change, they will not be able to provide adaptation benefits for people. The case for resourcing biodiversity conservation and building the resilience of ecosystems is also strengthened when there are direct benefits for people in addition to the more general benefits of biodiversity."
wg2_ch02_2.6 _p7,NO_TITLE,"Ecosystems are specifically included in the adaptation goals set out in the Paris Agreement and are addressed in most national adaptation plans (Seddon et al., 2020b). There are also now a large number of adaptation programmes and plans for local governments and governmental and non-governmental conservation organisations. Adaptation for and by ecosystems needs to be understood and developed in the wider contexts of conservation, climate resilient development and sustainable development. There are significant potential synergies but also conflicts between different objectives which require an integrated approach (covered further in 2.6.7)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Natural ecosystems often have a high degree of resilience and can, to some extent, adjust to change. Species can adjust through evolutionary adaptation, distribution change, behavioural change, developmental plasticity and ecophysiological adjustment. There are, however, limits to autonomous adaptation, because of intrinsic limitations, the rate at which the climate is changing and the degraded state of many ecosystems."
wg2_ch02_2.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"None of the evolutionary changes either documented or theorised would enable a species to survive and reproduce in climate spaces that it does not already inhabit. It is very improbable that evolutionary responses would be sufficient to prevent species extinctions in the case of that species losing its climate space entirely on a regional or global scale (section 2.4.2.8) (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015). At the highest risk are the world’s most cold-adapted species (whose habitats are restricted to polar and high mountain-top areas). Examples include the polar bear (Regehr et al., 2016), ‘sky-island’ plants in the Tropics (Kidane et al., 2019), mountain-top amphibians in Spain (Enriquez-Urzelai et al., 2019), mountain-top lichens in the Appalachians (USA) (Allen and Lendemer, 2016) and silverswords in Hawaii (Krushelnycky et al., 2013). However, there is potential for using evolutionary changes to enhance the adaptive capacity of target species, as is being done on the Great Barrier Reef by translocating symbionts and corals that have survived recent intense heat-induced bleaching events into areas that have had large die-off (Rinkevich, 2019). Multiple studies have assessed when and how evolution might be able to help wild species adapt to climate change (Ratnam et al., 2011; Sgro et al., 2011)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,Some of the reasons cited in the literature as limits to autonomous adaptation are:
wg2_ch02_2.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"There are a variety of mechanisms which promote the resilience of ecosystems through persistence, recovery and reorganisation (Falk et al., 2019). Changes in the balance of different plant species within a community can maintain the persistence of the community itself, maintaining its value as a habitat for other species and providing ecosystem services. In some cases, there are negative feedback mechanisms between biological and physical processes; for example, in peatlands, lowered water tables resulting from drier conditions can lead to reduced permeability of peat, increasing rates of water loss (Page and Baird, 2016). There are limits to this resilience and the concept of tipping points beyond which ecosystems change state, and returning to the original state has been subject of much recent research (van Nes et al., 2016). There is clear evidence that the degradation of ecosystems has reduced their resilience and that restoration can help to reduce risks to biodiversity and ecosystem services, discussed below (see Section 2.6.2, 2.6.3). However, as the rate of climate change increases, the limits of this approach will start to be reached, and losses (including some with potentially catastrophic consequences) cannot be prevented; this is discussed further in Section 2.6.6."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"A variety of approaches have been identified as potential adaptation measures which people can take to reduce the risks of climate change to biodiversity. (Heller and Zavaleta, 2009 ), quoted in AR5, identified 113 categories of recommendation for adaptation from a survey of 112 papers and reports. Since then, the literature has expanded with thousands of relevant publications. Whilst there is increasing interest in adaptation for biodiversity conservation and a wide range of plans and strategies, there is less evidence of these plans being implemented. Since AR5, a number of studies, predominantly from Europe and North America, have investigated the extent to which adaptation has been integrated into conservation planning and is being implemented on a local and regional scale (Macgregor and van Dijk, 2014; Delach et al., 2019; Prober et al., 2019; Clifford et al., 2020; Barr et al., 2021; Duffield et al., 2021). A common pattern in these studies is that vulnerability has been assessed and potential adaptation actions identified, but implementation has been limited beyond actions to improve ecological conditions which may increase resilience on a local scale."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"To date, most scientific literature on adaptation to reduce the risks to biodiversity from climate change has been based on ecological theory rather than on observations or practical experience. A recent review (Prober et al., 2019) concluded that out of 473 papers on adaptation, only 16% presented new empirical evidence and very few assessed the effectiveness of actual adaptation actions. It is also the case that relatively little research is focused on local-scale management interventions rather than on larger-scale strategies (Ledee et al., 2021), although there are some exceptions (Duffield et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Although direct assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation actions are rare, since AR5, there have been an increasing number of empirical analyses of how different land use and management can influence the vulnerability of species and habitats. As climate change often interacts with other factors including ecosystem degradation and fragmentation (Oliver et al., 2015a), actions to address these other interacting factors is expected to build resilience to climate change. Table 2.6 summarises evidence that supports the main categories of proposed adaptation measures. We have taken an inclusive approach and included studies that address extreme weather events such as droughts, which may be exacerbated by climate change, as well as long-term changes in climate variables. We have not distinguished between studies in which climate change adaptation was an explicit focus and those in which lessons for adaptation can be learnt, that is, when studies were conducted for other reasons but inform the assessment of the impacts of actions identified as potential adaptation measures."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Table 2.6 | Evidence to support proposed climate change adaptation measures for biodiversity. The evidence highlights that adaptation for biodiversity conservation is a broad concept, encompassing a wide range of actions. It includes targeted interventions to change the microclimate for particular species (e.g., by creating shade) to changing national conservation objectives to take account of changing distributions of species and communities. It includes targeted actions addressing both climate change and the protection and restoration of ecosystems, with multiple additional benefits including reduced vulnerability to climate change. Most of the studies are not direct tests of the impacts of adaptation actions which, as noted above, is an important gap in the evidence. There is also a major limitation in that reported studies are predominantly from Europe, North America and Australasia, with little research in other regions."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Many climate adaptation actions for biodiversity operate on the landscape scale (von Holle et al., 2020). The total area of habitat, how fragmented it is, the size of habitat patches and the connectivity between them are inter-linked properties on this scale. A growing number of studies have investigated how these properties affect species ability to persist in situ and colonise new areas. Overall, larger areas of semi-natural habitat are associated with increased resilience to ongoing climate change and extreme events as well as the capacity to colonise new areas (Haslem et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2017; Papanikolaou et al., 2017). Larger habitat patches can support larger populations of a given species, which are more likely to maintain themselves and recover from periods of adverse conditions. Inhabiting a large patch size has been found to increase the resilience of some populations of species to extreme events such as droughts (Oliver et al., 2015b). They are also more likely to provide a range of different resources and microclimate conditions, which may increase the chances of the persistence of species under climate change. A larger area of habitat may also enable greater connectivity between patches and increase the chances of species colonising new areas as they track climate change (Oliver et al., 2015b)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Protecting and restoring natural processes is a general principle for maintaining and building resilience to climate change for biodiversity (Timpane-Padgham et al., 2017). One element of this is ensuring naturally functioning hydrology for wetlands and river systems (Table 2.6), which is particularly important in a context of changing rainfall patterns and increased evapotranspiration. An important development in approaches to conservation over recent decades has been the concept of re-wilding (Schulte To Bühne et al., 2021); this encompasses a number of elements of restoring natural processes, including the reintroduction of top predators, larger conservation areas, and less prescriptive outcomes than many previous conservation measures. There are elements of re-wilding which may well contribute to building resilience to climate change, but it will be increasingly important to factor climate change adaptation into the planning of re-wilding schemes (Carroll and Noss, 2021)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"The most consistently cited climate change adaptation measure for species is increasing connectivity to facilitate the colonisation of new areas. This reflects the fact that many species’ habitats are highly fragmented in areas with more intensive land management, which prevents them naturally changing their range to track changing climatic conditions. Advances and innovations in modelling techniques can support decision-making about connectivity (Littlefield et al., 2019). There is evidence from empirical and modelling studies that species can disperse more effectively in better-connected areas in terrestrial habitats (Keeley et al., 2018). The issues are different in more natural landscapes—species may still be threatened in intrinsically isolated habitats, such as mountain tops, but connectivity cannot be created here in the same way. Evidence suggests that increased connectivity will only benefit a subset of species, probably those which are intermediate-habitat specialists that are able to disperse (Pearce-Higgins and Green, 2014). Generalists do not require corridors or stepping stones, while many corridors or stepping stones will not be of sufficient quality to be used by most habitat specialists. There should also be a caveat to the general principle that increasing connectivity is a benefit for climate change adaptation. It can increase the spread of invasive, pest and disease-causing species into newly suitable regions. In some places, isolated refugia may better allow vulnerable species and biological communities to survive."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"There are many different approaches to increasing connectivity, ranging from increasing the overall area of suitable habitat to ‘corridors’ and ‘stepping stones’, with different strategies likely to be more effective for different species and circumstances (Keeley et al., 2018). Connectivity can also be important in increasing the resilience of populations to extreme climatic events (Newson et al., 2014; Oliver et al., 2015b). Within freshwater environments, the connectivity of watercourses is essential. Fluvial corridors are necessary to ensure the survival of migrating fish populations, even without climate change; with climate change, connectivity becomes crucial for relatively cold-adapted organisms to migrate upstream to colder areas. Connectivity is also important for the larvae of benthic invertebrates to be able to drift downstream and hence to disperse (Brooks et al., 2018); for adult benthic invertebrates, riparian and terrestrial habitat features can potentially affect dispersal. Connectivity within river and wetland systems for some species can also mediated by more mobile animal species such as fish and birds (Martín-Vélez et al., 2020). Which factors are the most important in either promoting their colonisation of new sites or persisting in situ will differ between species and locations. Some general principles have been recognised and can guide conservation policy and practice (Natural England and RSPB, 2020; Stralberg et al., 2020), but this will often require additional investigation and planning based on an individual understanding of the niches of specific species."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Managed translocation, that is, moving species from areas where the climate is becoming unsuitable to places where their persistence under climate change is more likely , has been discussed as an adaptation option for many years. So far, there have been very few examples of this and it is likely to be a last resort in most cases, as it usually requires a large investment of resources, outcomes are uncertain and there may be adverse impacts on the receiving sites. Nevertheless, there are cases where it may be a be a viable option (Stralberg et al., 2019). This is discussed in more detail as a case study in Section 2.6.5.1."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"The evidence that species can persist in microclimatic refugia  where suitable conditions for them are maintained locally (e.g., because of variations in topography) has increased in recent years. This has opened up the potential to include refugia in conservation plans and strategies to facilitate the local survival of species (Jones et al., 2016; Morelli et al., 2016; Morelli et al., 2020), for example, targeting management actions (Sweet et al., 2019) aimed at supporting populations of species. This is likely to become an important aspect of climate change adaptation for biodiversity conservation in future. It is also possible to manipulate microclimate, for example, by creating shelters for birds’ nests; see Case Study in 2.6.5.5 of African penguins; (Patino-Martinez et al., 2012). One specific approach of this sort is the planting or retention of trees and wooded corridors to shade watercourses (Thomas et al., 2016). Riparian shading can also possibly help to reduce phytoplankton and benthic diatom growth in smaller streams and rivers (Halliday et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Refugia often refer to locally cool places in a landscape, such as shaded slopes or high elevations, but they can also include places where the supply of water may continue during dry periods (Morelli et al., 2016). Monitoring can reveal which streams, wetlands, springs and other aquatic resources retain suitable discharges, water quality, wetland area and ecological integrity, especially during dry years (Cartwright et al., 2020). Measures to conserve drought refugia may include protecting springs and other groundwater-fed systems from groundwater extraction, contamination, salinisation, surface-water diversion, channelisation of streams, trampling by livestock, recreation activities and invasive species and the effects of disturbances in the surrounding landscape (Cartwright et al., 2020; Krawchuk et al., 2020). Restoration of degraded aquatic ecosystems can include removing flow-diversion infrastructure, excluding livestock, reducing other human impacts, geomorphic restructuring, removing invasive species and planting native riparian vegetation."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p13,NO_TITLE,"In fire-prone areas, fire suppression and management are a key element of protecting refugia (Section 2.6.5.8 below). In ecosystems in which a natural fire regime has been suppressed, restoration practices such as prescribed fires, thinning trees and allowing some wildfire where it benefits the ecosystem can be introduced to reduce increasing risks from severe wildfires (Meigs et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p14,NO_TITLE,"Protected areas—areas of land set aside for species and habitat protection with legal protection from development or exploitation—have been a cornerstone of nature conservation for many years. Their effectiveness under a changing climate has been the subject of debate and investigation. There is now a large body of evidence demonstrating that colonisations by range-shifting species are more likely to occur at protected sites than at non-protected sites for a wide range of taxa (e.g., Thomas et al., 2012; Gillingham et al., 2015) including across continents (Pavón-Jordán et al., 2020). This is probably because, by protecting large areas of natural and semi-natural habitats, they provide suitable places for colonising species (Hiley et al., 2013) which may not be available in the surrounding landscape. Although the evidence for protected areas being associated with reduced extinctions is weaker, the finding by Gillingham et al. (Gillingham et al., 2015) that protected sites were associated with reduced extinction rates at low latitudes and elevations is strongly suggestive that they can help species’ persistence in the face of climate change."
wg2_ch02_2.6.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"It is intrinsically difficult to assess the effectiveness of climate change adaptation measures, the benefit of which will be realised in the years and decades ahead (Morecroft et al., 2019). Nevertheless, taking into account the wide range of evidence reported above, including the theory, modelling and observations of the impacts of climate change in contrasting circumstances, it is possible to make an overarching assessment that appropriate adaptation measures can reduce the vulnerability of many aspects of biodiversity to climate change (robust evidence, high agreement ). It is also clear, however, that to be most effective and avoid unintended consequences, measures need to be carefully implemented by taking into account specific local circumstances  (robust evidence, high agreement)  and include the management of inevitable changes (robust evidence, high agreement ). It is also clear that while there are now many plans and strategies for adapting biodiversity conservation to climate change, many have yet to be implemented fully (medium evidence, high agreement )."

wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"EbA includes a range of different approaches. Examples include restoring coastal and river systems to reduce flood risk and improve water quality, and the creation of natural areas within urban areas to reduce temperatures through shading and evaporative cooling. EbA is closely linked with a variety of other concepts such as ecosystem services, natural capital and disaster risk reduction (DRR). EbA was becoming a well-recognised concept at the time of AR5 but implementation was still at an early stage in many cases. Since then, pilot studies have been assessed and EbA projects have been initiated around the world. The evidence base continues to grow (Table 2.7), and this has led to increasing confidence in approaches which have been shown to work leading to further expansion in some countries (Table 2.7). However, this is not uniform and there is relatively little synthesis across disciplines and regions (Seddon et al., 2020a). Chausson et al. (2020) used a systematic mapping methodology to characterise 386 published studies. They found that interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems ameliorated adverse climate change impacts in 66% of cases, with fewer trade-offs than for more artificial systems such as plantation forest. However, the evidence base has substantial gaps. Most of the evidence has been collected in the Global North, and there is a lack of robust, site-specific investigations into the effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and more holistic appraisals that account for broader social and ecological outcomes."
wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Restoring coasts, rivers and wetlands to reduce flood risk have probably seen the largest investment in EbA and it is becoming an increasingly accepted approach in some places (e.g., case studies in Sections 2.6.5.2, 2.6.5.7), although significant social, economic and technical barriers remain (Wells et al., 2020; Bark et al., 2021; Hagedoorn et al., 2021). Natural flood management (NFM) encompasses a wide range of techniques in river systems and at the coast and has been used in varied locations around the world. In tropical and subtropical areas, the restoration of mangroves to reduce the risk of coastal flooding is a widely advocated, evidence-based approach (e.g., (Høye et al., 2013; Sierra-Correa and Kintz, 2015; Powell et al., 2019)). In temperate regions, salt marsh is a similarly important habitat (Spalding et al., 2014). Both provide buffering against SLR and storm surges. Managed realignment of the coast, by creating new habitats, can lead to a loss of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, but it can protect them and the services they provide by reducing the risks of catastrophic failure from hard-engineered sea defences."

wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"In river systems (Iacob et al., 2014), management of both the catchments and the channel itself is important: restoring natural meanders in canalised watercourses and allowing the build-up of woody debris can slow flows rates; restoring upstream wetlands or creating them in urban and peri-urban situations can store water during flood events if they are in the right place in a catchment (Acreman and Holden, 2013; Ameli and Creed, 2019; Wu et al., 2020). There is less data on the potential for NFM in tropical compared to temperate catchments. However, (Ogden et al., 2013) showed that flooding was reduced from a secondary forested catchment area compared to those which were pasture or a mosaic of forest, pasture and subsistence agriculture. EbA approaches to reduce flooding can be applied within urban areas as well as in rural catchments, as in Durban, South Africa (Section 2.6.5.7), but effectiveness will depend on EbA being implemented at a sufficient scale and in the right locations (Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Costa et al., 2021). This may, in turn, provide protection to downstream urban communities."
wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Protecting and restoring natural river systems and natural vegetation cover within catchments as well as integrating agro-ecological techniques into agricultural systems can also help to maintain and manage water supplies for human use, under climate change, including during periods of drought, by storing water in catchments and improving water quality (Taffarello et al., 2018; Agol et al., 2021; Khaniya et al., 2021). Lara et al. (2021) showed that replacing a non-native Eucalyptus plantation in Chile with native forest caused base flow to increase by 28–87% during the restoration period compared to pre-treatment, and found that it remained during periods with low summer precipitation."
wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"EbA can operate on a range of different scales, from local to catchment to region. On the local scale, there is a variety of circumstances in which microclimates can be managed and local temperatures lowered by the presence of vegetation (Table 2.7), and these EbA techniques are now being used more widely. In both urban and agricultural situations, shade trees are a traditional technique which can be applied to contemporary climate change adaptation. As reported in Section 2.6.2 above, shading of watercourses can lower temperatures, which can allow species to survive locally; as well as supporting diversity, it can help to maintain important fisheries, including those of salmonid fish (O’Briain et al., 2020). Within cities, green spaces, including parks, local nature reserves and green roofs and walls can also provide cooling as a result of evapotranspiration (Bowler et al., 2010a; Aram et al., 2019; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020), although this may be reduced in drought conditions."

wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"EbA is usually a place-specific approach and a number of studies have documented how attempts to implement it without an understanding of local circumstances and the full engagement of local communities have been unsuccessful (Nalau et al., 2018).

Considering these sources, others described above and the case studies presented in Section 2.6.5, a number of requirements for effective implementation of EbA can be identified, including the following:"
wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"Whilst it is essential to develop place-specific EbA measures with the full engagement of local communities, it is worth noting that new opportunities may emerge that would not have been possible in the past. As the climate changes, novel ecosystems may emerge (with no present day analogue) which have the potential to provide different adaptation benefits, and societies may be more willing to adopt transformative approaches (Colloff et al., 2017; Lavorel et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p13,NO_TITLE,"Increasingly, it is essential to integrate adaptation and the protection of biodiversity with land-based initiatives to mitigate climate change; this is discussed in more detail in Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter.

wg2_ch02_2.6.3_p14,NO_TITLE,"Whilst policy interest is growing and there is an increasing deployment of EbA, there is still a long way to go in delivering its full potential (Huq and Stubbings, 2015) and significant institutional and cultural barriers remain (Huq et al., 2017; Nalau et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that EbA can offer a portfolio of effective measures to reduce the risks for people of climate change at the same time as benefitting biodiversity (robust evidence, high agreement ), providing that such measures are deployed with careful planning in a way that is appropriate for local ecological and societal contexts (robust evidence, high agreement ). This chapter has identified risks to species, communities, ecosystems and ecosystem services from climate change, all of which increase with each increment of Global Warming Level (2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4). There is therefore a risk to Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures in some circumstances and this risk increases progressively above 1.5°C of warming."
wg2_ch02_2.6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Low-probability events can have a very high impact (e.g., the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from wild animals to humans, causing the Covid-19 pandemic ). A robust disease risk reduction policy would include utilising One Biosecurity (Meyerson and Reaser, 2002; Hulme, 2020; MacLeod and Spence, 2020) or One Health (Monath et al., 2010; Deem et al., 2018; Destoumieux-Garzón et al., 2018; Zinsstag et al., 2018) approaches with actions to reduce disease risk across multiple sectors and from a variety of anthropogenic drivers, including climate change, even if there is high uncertainty in projected risk (see Cross-Chapter Boxes ILLNESS in this chapter, COVID in Chapter 7 and DEEP in Chapter 17). Kraemer et al. (2019) found that vector importation was a key risk factor and that the focus should be on preventing the introduction of invasive species. Furthermore, many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are also VBDs, and the UN SDG of good health and well-being explicitly calls for increased control and intervention with a focus on emergency preparedness and response (Stensgaard et al., 2019a)."

Forecasting models to warn of human disease outbreaks like malaria and dengue are also now available, with findings that multiple-model ensemble forecasts outperform individual models (Lowe et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018; Johansson et al., 2019; Tompkins et al., 2019; Muñoz et al., 2020; Colón-González et al., 2021; Petrova et al., 2021). Improving VBD and NTD public health responses will require multi-disciplinary teams capable of interpreting, analysing, and synthesising diverse components of complex ecosystem-based studies for effective intervention (Mills et al., 2010; Rubin et al., 2014; Valenzuela and Aksoy, 2018), broad epidemiological and entomological surveillance (Depaquit et al., 2010; Lindgren et al., 2012; Springer et al., 2016) as well as community-based disease control programmes that build local capacity (Andersson et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2020b)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5_p1,2.6.5.1 Case Study: Assisted Colonisation/Managed Relocation in Practice ,"Adaptation plans for biodiversity and EbA have been adopted in many places and on different scales, but it is difficult to get a systematic overview of adaptation in practice. We have therefore reviewed a series of contrasting case studies to illustrate some of the key issues. There is a pressing need for more thorough monitoring and evaluation of adaptation to assess effectiveness. Climate change adaptation is conceptually difficult to measure, but it is possible to test which techniques work in reducing vulnerability and to monitor their deployment (Morecroft et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5_p2,2.6.5.1 Case Study: Assisted Colonisation/Managed Relocation in Practice ,"Adaptation can take place on a range of scales, with specific projects nested within overarching national strategies. Small-scale projects can be adaptation-focused, but on the larger scale, adaptation is often integrated with wider objectives. Within an urban or peri-urban context, the benefits of natural and semi-natural areas for health and well-being help to justify support for EbA. Economic well-being is also an important factor in many cases whether, as in Durban, South Africa (Section 2.6.5.7), it provides new job opportunities or, as in the Andes (Section 2.6.5.4), it supports long-established agricultural practices. Action on the ground often depends on factors on a range of scales, for example, a local plan, a national strategy and international funding. In Durban, partnerships between local communities, local authorities and the academic community were essential, together with an international context. Nevertheless, there are examples of communities using traditional or local knowledge (LK) to adapt to changing circumstances, with little or no external input, (Section 2.6.5.4); Their scope for adaptation is, however, often limited by factors beyond their direct control."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5_p3,2.6.5.1 Case Study: Assisted Colonisation/Managed Relocation in Practice ,"Specific interventions to protect species from climate change, such as the case of African penguins in South Africa (Section 2.6.5.5) and threatened plant species in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (Section 2.6.5.8), are rare. However, in countries where nature reserves are actively managed or where ecosystem restoration projects are progressing, local practitioners may use their knowledge to adapt to weather conditions and their associated effects (e.g., fire and water shortages). This is good practice, but it may not be sufficient to address the likely future changes in climate (Duffield et al., 2021). Training and resources to support conservation practitioners are becoming available. Examples include the Climate Change Adaptation Manual in England, UK (Section 2.6.5.2), and The Alliance for Freshwater Life (https://allianceforfreshwaterlife.org) which provides expertise for the sustainable management of freshwater biodiversity (Darwall et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5_p4,2.6.5.1 Case Study: Assisted Colonisation/Managed Relocation in Practice ,"Adaptation is widely recognised as important for national conservation policies and is being considered in a variety of countries (Section 2.6.5.2, 2.6.5.3). Adaptation in this strategic context includes decisions about the selection and objectives for protected areas, for example, identifying places which can act as refugia. It can also mean recognising where protected areas remain important but will support a changing range of species and ecosystems. This is important for directing resources effectively and ensuring that the management of the sites remains appropriate. There are, however, often major uncertainties, and the extent to which there will be a need for more radical measures will depend on the success of reducing GHG emissions globally. A global rise of 1.5°C–2°C would require relatively incremental adjustments to conservation management in many parts of the world, but a 3°C–4°C rise would require radical, transformational changes to preserve many species and maintain ecosystem services (Morecroft et al., 2012)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5_p5,2.6.5.1 Case Study: Assisted Colonisation/Managed Relocation in Practice ,"Whilst adaptation strategies for conservation are relatively common, at least on an outline level, their implementation is slow in most places. This may partly reflect a lack of resources for conservation in many parts of the world; however, another barrier is that people often value protected sites in their present form. Actions which might jeopardise this are inevitably a last resort. Initiatives to engage wider communities in discussions are likely to be essential in gaining support for such changing approaches."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5_p6,2.6.5.1 Case Study: Assisted Colonisation/Managed Relocation in Practice ,"EbA and adaptation for biodiversity are intrinsically linked and the largest-scale interventions for adaptation in ecosystems have tended to bring together both elements. For example, adaptation to reduce the risk of flooding by habitat creation and using natural processes (Section 2.6.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3), such as re-naturalising straightened river systems or creating wetlands for water storage, offers the potential to meet multiple objectives and has increased the overall funding available for ecosystem restoration."

It requires careful consideration of scientific, ethical, economic and legal issues between the object of relocation and the receiving ecosystem (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2008; Richardson et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2012)."

Anich and Ward (2017) extended the geographic breeding range of a rare bird, Kirtland’s warbler, Setophaga kirtlandii, by 225 km by using song playbacks to attract migrating individuals. Wadgymar (2015) successfully transplanted an annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, to sites beyond its current poleward range limit, while Liu (2012) found that all but one of 20 orchid species survived when transplanted to higher elevations than their current range limits. After introducing two British butterfly species to sites ∼65 and ∼35 km beyond their poleward range margins, Willis (2009) observed that both of these populations grew, expanded their ranges and survived for at least the 8 year span of the study."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Butterflies have been favoured subjects for assisted migration in response to regional climate warming, since they are easy to move and their range dynamics have been extensively studied. The Chequered Skipper, Carterocephalus palaemon, became locally extinct in England in the 1970s, in an area not close to either the species’ poleward or equatorial range limits. Nonetheless, Maes (2019) considers climate a crucial parameter for reintroduction, using SDMs for both choosing the source population in Belgium and introduction site."

(2019) identified 56 successes and 33 failures among 107 translocations of insects undertaken explicitly for conservation purposes. They concluded that failure was most strongly associated with the low numbers of individuals being released. Another potential source of failure is local adaptation: there is good evidence that adaptive differences among potential source populations can be important. For example, the transplants of Chamaecrista fasciculata were more successful when sourced from the most poleward existing sites, while individuals from more equatorial habitats performed poorly even when artificially warmed (Wadgymar et al., 2015)."

These threats are exacerbated by land use and management, for example, fragmenting habitats, draining land and straightening rivers. There are also risks to people, which are exacerbated by environmental factors, including flooding and over-heating in urban areas. The National Adaptation Programme provides a broad policy framework for England and includes a chapter on the natural environment. There are also adaptation plans produced by public bodies such as Natural England and the UK Environment Agency, with a wide range of responsibilities including flood defence. The principles of adaptation to climate change are well established in the UK conservation community and resources are available. Natural England has published a Climate Change Adaptation Manual jointly with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (a major conservation NGO) (Natural England and RSPB, 2020) and a spatial mapping tool for vulnerability to climate change (Taylor et al., 2014)."

Over the last decade, a series of NFM projects have been established in local areas. The Environment Agency collated the evidence base for NFM (Burgess-Gamble et al., 2021) and was able to draw on 65 case studies (Ngai et al., 2017) covering the management of rivers and floodplains, woodlands, runoff, and coasts and estuaries."

Dadson et al. (2017) concluded that ‘the hazard associated with small floods in small catchments may be significantly reduced’ by NFM techniques.

Most protected areas in Thailand were established on an ad hoc basis to protect remaining forest cover and, as a result, they do not represent diverse habitats and their associated species (Chutipong et al., 2014; Tantipisanuh, 2016) so they may not be resilient to the interacting impacts of future land use and climate change (Klorvuttimontara et al., 2011; Trisurat, 2018)."

Climate-driven upwards migration of species, associated with warming and glacier retreat, has modified species distribution and richness and community composition along the Andes altitudinal gradient (Seimon et al., 2017; Carilla et al., 2018; Zimmer et al., 2018; Moret et al., 2019). Climate-driven glacier retreat alters hydrological regimes, directly impacting Andean pastoralists (López-i-Gelats et al., 2016; Postigo, 2020; Thompson et al., 2021) and the provision of water to lowland regions (Vuille et al., 2018; Hock et al., 2019; Orlove et al., 2019; Rasul and Molden, 2019). The drying of wetlands has modified alpine plant communities, which are relevant for storing carbon, regulating water and providing food for local livestock; this has led to negative impacts on herders’ livelihoods (Dangles et al., 2017; Polk et al., 2017; Postigo, 2020) and affecting the wild vicuña and the domesticated alpaca and llama. The wool from Vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) and alpaca (V. pacos) is an important source of income for indigenous communities and the llama (Lama glama) is their main source of meat. Vicuña are adjusting their feeding behaviour and spatial distribution as vegetation migrates upwards (Reider and Schmidt, 2020), causing them to roam outside protected areas and become vulnerable to illegal poaching."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Andean herders have responded to the drying of grasslands by increasing livestock mobility, accessing new grazing areas through kinship and leases, creating and expanding wetlands through building long irrigation canals (several kilometres in length), limiting the allocation of wetlands to new households and sometimes cultivating grasses (Postigo, 2013; López-i-Gelats et al., 2015; Postigo, 2020). These adaptive responses to regional climate change are enabled by deeply embedded indigenous institutions that have traditionally governed Andean pastoralists, but they have become severely compromised by national socioeconomic pressures (Valdivia et al., 2010; Postigo, 2019; Postigo, 2020). For instance, the quality of water and local pastoralists’ access to it and control of it have declined, due to new mining concessions granted in the headwaters of Andean watersheds (Bebbington and Bury, 2009) and the diversion of water to areas of lowland coastal desert for agricultural irrigation (Mark et al., 2017)."

In Peru, montane ice-field meltwater provides 80% of the water resources for the arid coast where half the population lives (Thompson et al., 2021). Increasing variability of precipitation has compromised rain-fed agriculture and power generation, particularly in the dry season, exacerbating pressures for new sources of water (Bradley et al., 2006; Bury et al., 2013; Buytaert et al., 2017).

Ninety-six percent of the population of this species has been lost since 1900, with a 77% decline in the last two decades (Sherley et al., 2018). By 2019, only 17,700 pairs remained (Sherley et al., 2020). The species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List (Birdlife International, 2018) and if this trajectory persists, the African penguin will become functionally extinct in the near future (Sherley et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.5.5 _p4,NO_TITLE,"Historically, hunting and the collection of eggs and guano were the main threats, but three aspects of climate change now predominate. Firstly, an eastward shift of several hundred kilometres in the distributions of their main prey species, anchovies and sardines, has reduced food availability (Roy et al., 2007; Crawford et al., 2011). While adult penguins typically forage up to 400 km from their colonies, they are restricted to a ~20-km radius from their colonies during breeding months (Ludynia et al., 2012; Pichegru et al., 2012). The resulting food shortage at this critical time is compounded by competition with commercial fisheries and environmental fluctuations (Crawford et al., 2011; Pichegru et al., 2012; Sherley et al., 2018). This has impacted adults’ survival and their ability to raise high-quality offspring (Crawford et al., 2006; Crawford et al., 2011; Sherley et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014)."

Nests were historically built in insulated guano burrows, but are now frequently sited on open ground (Kemper et al., 2007; Pichegru et al., 2012; Sherley et al., 2012). High temperatures frequently expose the birds to severe heat stress, causing adults to abandon their nests and resulting in the mortality of eggs and chicks (Frost et al., 1976; Shannon and Crawford, 1999; Pichegru et al., 2012). Intensifying storm surges and greater wave heights can cause nest flooding (Randall et al., 1986; de Villiers, 2002)."

A second approach is to establish breeding colonies closer to their prey. An ongoing translocation initiative aims to entice birds eastwards, to recolonise an extinct breeding colony and potentially establish a new one (Schwitzer et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014; Birdlife International, 2018). Penguin ‘look-alikes’ or decoys, constructed from rubber and concrete, have been placed at the site of the extinct colony, and, along with call play-backs, these give the illusion of an established penguin colony (Morris and Hagen, 2018).

Palaeo-biological data from packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens and fossilised dung of the extinct Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis) show that Joshua trees grew 13,000–22,000 years ago across a wider range, extending as far as 300 km south into what is now México (Holmgren et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2011). A major retraction of this range began ~11,700 years ago, coinciding with warming of approximately 4°C, caused by Milankovitch cycles, which marked the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene (Cole et al., 2011), suggesting a sensitivity of Joshua trees of 300 km of latitude per 4°C."

The city, situated in a global biodiversity hotspot (World Bank, 2016), has a rapidly growing population (approximately 3.5 million) and is highly fragmented (Roberts et al., 2013). High levels of development, particularly in peri-urban areas, have encroached into natural habitats (World Bank, 2016). Degradation of the natural resource base in this way has direct economic and financial costs, is threatening Durban’s long-term sustainability and is exacerbated by climate change (World Bank, 2016; eThekwini Municipality, 2020). The impacts of climate change are anticipated to increase unless appropriate mitigation and adaptation interventions are prioritised (eThekwini Municipality, 2020). High rates of poverty, unemployment and health problems have pushed Durban to explore a climate change adaptation work stream within its MCPP (Roberts et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2020b)."

Durban’s climate change adaptation work stream is composed of three separate components: municipal adaptation (adaptation activities linked to the key functions of local government), community-based adaptation (CbA, focused on improving the adaptive capacity of local communities), and a series of urban management interventions (addressing specific challenges such as the urban heat island, increased storm-water runoff, water conservation and SLR) (Roberts et al., 2013)."

Projects for the restoration of natural habitats are seen as an ideal tool, as they combine mitigation outcomes with an increased adaptation capacity, not only reducing the vulnerability of ecosystems and communities (Douwes et al., 2016) but creating economic opportunities. These include direct job creation (Diederichs and Roberts, 2016; Douwes and Buthelezi, 2016) with various spin-offs such as better education for schoolchildren (Douwes et al., 2015). Indirect benefits, including better water quality and reduced flooding, are generated as a result of improved ecosystem service delivery (Douwes and Buthelezi, 2016). In areas that are already developed, opportunities for green-roof infrastructure can yield reductions in roof storm-water runoff (by approx.. 60 ml/m 2/min during a rainfall event), slow the release of water over time and reduce temperatures on roof surfaces (Roberts et al., 2012)."

The exclusion of fire from stands of fire-sensitive trees such as the pencil pine, Athrotaxis cupressoides, is part of this management strategy, possible in the past due to the moisture differential and lower flammability of these areas. However, in recent years, the threat posed by extensive and repeated wildfires and increasing awareness that fire risk is likely to increase (Fox-Hughes et al., 2014; Love et al., 2017; Love et al., 2019) have meant that more direct management intervention has been implemented. There has been a realisation that a ‘hands off’ approach to managing the threat will not be sufficient to protect the palaeo-endemics. Not only is fire-fighting difficult in this remote wilderness area, but limited resources mean that fire managers must prioritise where fires will be fought when many fires are threatening towns and lives across the state simultaneously."

These approaches are thought to have been effective at halting the fire and protecting high-value vegetation in some situations. Impact reports are currently being finalised to quantify the extent of fire-sensitive vegetation communities that have been affected. However, there is concern that these interventions may have adverse effects on the values of the TWWHA if applied widely, so while research is ongoing, these will only be applied in strategic areas (e.g., fire retardant is not being applied to some areas)."

The drying of wetlands has modified alpine plant communities, which are relevant for storing carbon, regulating water and providing food for local livestock; this has led to negative impacts on herders’ livelihoods (Dangles et al., 2017; Polk et al., 2017; Postigo, 2020) and affecting the wild vicuña and the domesticated alpaca and llama. The wool from Vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) and alpaca (V. pacos) is an important source of income for indigenous communities and the llama (Lama glama) is their main source of meat.

These adaptive responses to regional climate change are enabled by deeply embedded indigenous institutions that have traditionally governed Andean pastoralists, but they have become severely compromised by national socioeconomic pressures (Valdivia et al., 2010; Postigo, 2019; Postigo, 2020). For instance, the quality of water and local pastoralists’ access to it and control of it have declined, due to new mining concessions granted in the headwaters of Andean watersheds (Bebbington and Bury, 2009) and the diversion of water to areas of lowland coastal desert for agricultural irrigation (Mark et al., 2017)."

An ongoing translocation initiative aims to entice birds eastwards, to recolonise an extinct breeding colony and potentially establish a new one (Schwitzer et al., 2013; Sherley et al., 2014; Birdlife International, 2018). Penguin ‘look-alikes’ or decoys, constructed from rubber and concrete, have been placed at the site of the extinct colony, and, along with call play-backs, these give the illusion of an established penguin colony (Morris and Hagen, 2018).

Palaeo-biological data from packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens and fossilised dung of the extinct Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis) show that Joshua trees grew 13,000–22,000 years ago across a wider range, extending as far as 300 km south into what is now México (Holmgren et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2011). A major retraction of this range began ~11,700 years ago, coinciding with warming of approximately 4°C, caused by Milankovitch cycles, which marked the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene (Cole et al., 2011), suggesting a sensitivity of Joshua trees of 300 km of latitude per 4°C."

The city, situated in a global biodiversity hotspot (World Bank, 2016), has a rapidly growing population (approximately 3.5 million) and is highly fragmented (Roberts et al., 2013). High levels of development, particularly in peri-urban areas, have encroached into natural habitats (World Bank, 2016). Degradation of the natural resource base in this way has direct economic and financial costs, is threatening Durban’s long-term sustainability and is exacerbated by climate change (World Bank, 2016; eThekwini Municipality, 2020). The impacts of climate change are anticipated to increase unless appropriate mitigation and adaptation interventions are prioritised (eThekwini Municipality, 2020). High rates of poverty, unemployment and health problems have pushed Durban to explore a climate change adaptation work stream within its MCPP (Roberts et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2020b)."

Projects for the restoration of natural habitats are seen as an ideal tool, as they combine mitigation outcomes with an increased adaptation capacity, not only reducing the vulnerability of ecosystems and communities (Douwes et al., 2016) but creating economic opportunities. These include direct job creation (Diederichs and Roberts, 2016; Douwes and Buthelezi, 2016) with various spin-offs such as better education for schoolchildren (Douwes et al., 2015). Indirect benefits, including better water quality and reduced flooding, are generated as a result of improved ecosystem service delivery (Douwes and Buthelezi, 2016). In areas that are already developed, opportunities for green-roof infrastructure can yield reductions in roof storm-water runoff (by approx.. 60 ml/m 2/min during a rainfall event), slow the release of water over time and reduce temperatures on roof surfaces (Roberts et al., 2012)."

The exclusion of fire from stands of fire-sensitive trees such as the pencil pine, Athrotaxis cupressoides, is part of this management strategy, possible in the past due to the moisture differential and lower flammability of these areas. However, in recent years, the threat posed by extensive and repeated wildfires and increasing awareness that fire risk is likely to increase (Fox-Hughes et al., 2014; Love et al., 2017; Love et al., 2019) have meant that more direct management intervention has been implemented. There has been a realisation that a ‘hands off’ approach to managing the threat will not be sufficient to protect the palaeo-endemics. Not only is fire-fighting difficult in this remote wilderness area, but limited resources mean that fire managers must prioritise where fires will be fought when many fires are threatening towns and lives across the state simultaneously."

These approaches are thought to have been effective at halting the fire and protecting high-value vegetation in some situations. Impact reports are currently being finalised to quantify the extent of fire-sensitive vegetation communities that have been affected. However, there is concern that these interventions may have adverse effects on the values of the TWWHA if applied widely, so while research is ongoing, these will only be applied in strategic areas (e.g., fire retardant is not being applied to some areas)."

Replanting native trees has had relatively little success (Lampela et al., 2017) because such trees have low tolerance to prolonged inundation and no fire adaptation strategies (Page et al., 2009; Roucoux et al., 2013; Dohong et al., 2018; Cole et al., 2019; Luom, 2020; Giesen, 2021)."

Planning to manage the consequences of inevitable changes and prioritise investments in conservation actions where they have the best chance of succeeding (e.g., Section 2.6.5.6) will be an increasingly necessary component of adaptation (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Table 2.6)."

It will also be less successful for larger species and more mobile ones. The microclimate of a tree is much more closely coupled with wider atmospheric conditions than that of a small plant or animal in the boundary layer, and mobile species like birds and large mammals range over large areas rather than being confined to discrete locations where conditions can be manipulated."

All of these interventionist approaches are constrained by requiring significant financial resources and expertise. They also require a high level of understanding of individual species autecology, which can take years to acquire, even when resources are available.

This tree became invasive and has already replaced >50% of the savanna habitat in the Baluran National Park, with complete replacement expected in the near future. This shift from savanna to acacia forest is causing large declines in native species, including the charismatic wild banteng, Bos javanicus, and the wild dog (dhole, Cuon alpinus) (Caesariantika et al., 2011; Padmanaba et al., 2017; Zahra et al., 2020).

An overview of the importance of specific ecosystem services for CRD is presented in Box 18.7 in Chapter 18. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the extent to which human life, well-being and economies are dependent on healthy ecosystems and also the range of threats that these are faced with (high confidence) (IPBES, 2019; Dasgupta, 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021). An analysis of 64 studies found a strong positive synergy among eight critical regulating services of healthy ecosystems, including climate regulation, water provisioning, pest and disease control and adjacent-crop pollination (Lee and Lautenbach, 2016). The health of ecosystems is, in turn, reliant upon the maintenance of natural levels of species’ richness and functional diversity (high confidence) (Lavorel et al., 2020) (see Section 2.5.4). A meta-analysis of 74 studies documented that the mechanism for increased ecosystem stability is increased asynchrony among species, which itself is a product of greater species diversity (Xu et al., 2021b). Responding to these threats requires the protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, together with sustainable management of other areas."

Hannah et al. (2020) estimated that limiting warming to 2°C and protecting 30% of high-biodiversity regions (in Africa, Asia and Latin America) reduced the risk of species’ extinctions by half (medium confidence). The placement of protected areas is as important as the total area (Pimm et al., 2018), and the quality of the protection (strictness and enforcement) is as important as the official land designation (Shah et al., 2021). Pimm et al. (2018) found that many small protected areas are successful because they are in areas of very high biodiversity containing species with small range sizes, while many large regions identified as wild are often of low biodiversity value even though they may have a high mitigation value (e.g., the high Arctic tundra). A global meta-analysis of 89 restoration projects found that biodiversity increased by 44% and ecosystem services by 25% after restoration but values remained lower than in intact reference systems (Rey Benayas et al., 2009)."
wg2_ch02_2.6.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is also increasing evidence, reported in this chapter, that the loss and degradation of natural and semi-natural habitats exacerbates the impacts of climate change and climatic extreme events on biodiversity and ecosystem services (high confidence) (e.g., in (Ogden et al., 2013; Eigenbrod et al., 2015; Struebig et al., 2015; Stevens et al., 2016; Oliver et al., 2017; McAlpine et al., 2018; Taffarello et al., 2018; Lehikoinen et al., 2019; Birk et al., 2020; Chapman et al., 2020; Agol et al., 2021; Khaniya et al., 2021; Lara et al., 2021; Lehikoinen et al., 2021).

Restoration of peatlands is not only an efficient climate solution in terms of emissions of GHGs (Nugent et al., 2019), it may also increase ecosystem resilience (Glenk et al., 2021). Global restoration efforts are ongoing to target degraded temperate peatlands in the Americas and Europe (Chimner et al., 2017) in recognition of their importance for climate change mitigation (Paustian et al., 2016; Bossio et al., 2020; Humpenöder et al., 2020; Drever et al., 2021; Tanneberger et al., 2021). It has been estimated that the global GHG-saving potential of peatland restoration is similar to the most optimistic sequestration potential from all agricultural soils (Leifeld and Menichetti, 2018). However, the pressure on peatlands from human activity remains high in many parts of the world (Humpenöder et al., 2020; Tanneberger et al., 2021). Currently, the rapid destruction of tropical peatlands overshadows any current restoration efforts in temperate peatlands or any potential carbon gain from natural high-latitude peatlands (Roucoux et al., 2017; Wijedasa et al., 2017; Leifeld et al., 2019) (Sections 2.4.3.8, 2.4.4.4.2, 2.4.4.4.4, 2.5.2.8, 2.5.3.4)."

A number of the case studies above, such as in Durban and at Bhojtal Lake, illustrate this (section 2.6.5). A key element of CRD is ensuring that actions taken to mitigate climate change do not compromise adaptation, biodiversity and human needs. This depends on choosing appropriate actions for different locations (Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). A particularly notable case of this is the creation of woodland described in Box 2.2: re-afforestation of previously forested areas can provide multiple benefits (Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020) including those for climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity. However, planting trees where they would not naturally grow can create multiple problems including the loss of native biodiversity and the disruption of hydrology (Box 2.2). It is also the case that protection of existing natural forest ecosystems is the highest priority for reducing GHG emissions (Moomaw et al., 2019) and restoration may not always be practical (see Section 2.6.5.10). (Sections 2.4.3.6, 2.4.3.7, 2.4.4.3, 2.4.4.4, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.2.7, 2.5.3.3, Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter)"
wg2_ch02_2.6.7_p7,NO_TITLE,"In some cases, actions supported by international donors and presented as addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation in the natural environment can have damaging consequences for people and nature as well as failing to deliver adaptation and mitigation. One example of this was presented by Work et al. (2019), who reviewed three climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in Cambodia: an irrigation project, a protected-area forest management project and a reforestation project. In each case, they found evidence of the rights of local communities being violated, maladaptation and the destruction of biodiverse habitats. They concluded that the potential for maladaptation and adverse social and environmental impacts had been ignored by international donors and the national authorities, and that there was a need for much stricter accountability mechanisms. Moyo et al. (2021), using case studies from South Africa, documented greater success of ecosystem restoration projects when they embraced broader SDGs, particularly enhancement of people’s livelihoods. Better assessment of the impacts of adaptation and mitigation measures on people and ecosystems, before they are implemented, will be increasingly necessary to avoid unintended and damaging consequences as their deployment is scaled up (Larsen, 2014; Enríquez-de-Salamanca et al., 2017; Pour et al., 2017). This applies to ostensibly nature-based approaches as well as more engineering-based ones."

Meta-analyses of 162 studies involving 51,738 people documented that individuals with high levels of contact with nature throughout their lives felt significantly happier, healthier and more satisfied with their lives, and engaged in more pro-nature behaviours than those with little or no contact with nature (high confidence) (Capaldi et al., 2014; Mackay and Schmitt, 2019; Pritchard et al., 2020; Whitburn et al., 2020). Meta-analyses of manipulative human trials across 65 studies documented a significant increase in positive feelings and attitudes and a decline in negative feelings after experimental treatments involving nature (medium confidence) (Bowler et al., 2010b; McMahan and Estes, 2015; Soga et al., 2017). In the context of CRD improving the extent to which humans see themselves as part of the natural world— known as human-nature connectedness (HNC)— increasing access to natural areas, particularly within urban areas, can provide additional health, cultural and recreation benefits of NbS as well as increasing public engagement and support (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Wilbanks, 2003; Nelson et al., 2007; Bowler et al., 2010b; Capaldi et al., 2014; McMahan and Estes, 2015; Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Soga et al., 2017; Mackay and Schmitt, 2019; Work et al., 2019; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Pritchard et al., 2020; Whitburn et al., 2020)."

Climate change is bringing an increasing number of threats to people, including flooding, droughts, wildfire, heat waves and rising sea levels. These threats can, however, be reduced or aggravated, depending on how land, sea and freshwater are managed or protected.

wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p1,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC (2018a) defined feasibility as ‘the degree to which climate goals and response options are considered possible and/or desirable’ (IPCC, 2018b) and set out an approach to assessing the feasibility of pathways to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Singh et al. (2020) developed this approach for adaptation, recognising six different dimensions of feasibility: economic, technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological and geophysical (Table 2.9). Feasibility is considered more fully in other chapters of this report, including Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18. Adaptation for biodiversity conservation and EbA encompasses a large range of approaches and techniques (Sections 2.6.2, 2.6.3) and will vary in different contexts globally, as illustrated by the range of case studies (Section 2.6.5). It is important to take into account specific regional and local circumstances as well as the type of adaptation action envisaged before making a feasibility assessment. It is also important to note that what is a feasible adaptation response at one point in time may change with the level of warming experienced—some techniques will be become less effective at higher levels of warming. With global temperature rises of <2°C, in many cases, it will be realistic to build resilience and maintain species and ecosystems in situ, but, at higher levels of warming, this will become increasingly difficult; managing inevitable change, including the consequences of loss and damage, will be important (Prober et al., 2019). Similarly, to be effective at higher levels of warming may require the adaptation of the EbA approaches themselves (Calliari et al., 2019; Martín et al., 2021; Ossola and Lin, 2021). We have therefore not attempted a global-scale assessment of the feasibility of adaptation options, but rather present some key cross-cutting considerations in assessing feasibility for adaptation of and through ecosystems."
wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Many of the necessary techniques for climate change adaptation for biodiversity and EbA have been demonstrated and shown to provide a wide range of additional benefits. This does, however, depend on deploying the right techniques in the right place (Box 2.2) as well as engaging local communities (see Section 2.6.6). There is also a challenge where there is high demand for land for other purposes, especially for agriculture and urban development. Table 2.8 summarises the main feasibility considerations, drawing on previous sections. An assessment of constraints on EbA by Nalau et al. (2018) addressed similar issues."

wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p5,NO_TITLE,"A key element of economic feasibility is the cost of adaptation options. Costs of adaptation vary greatly depending on the actions taken, the location, the methods used, the need for ongoing maintenance and whether land purchase is necessary. At its simplest, adaptation may be a matter of taking account of actual or potential climate change impacts in the course of conservation planning and have little or no additional cost. For example, if a species of conservation concern colonises or starts to use a new area as a result of climate change, like migrant waterfowl shifting the locations where they overwinter (Pavón-Jordán et al., 2020), protection or habitat management may be redirected there. At the other extreme, large-scale restoration can incur significant costs, for example, between 1993 and 2015, the EU-LIFE nature programme invested 167.6 million Euro in 80 projects, which aim to restore over 913 km 2 of peatland habitats in Western European countries (Andersen et al., 2017). This is equivalent to <2% of the remaining peatland area, much of which has been affected to at least some extent by human pressures, and restoring the total affected area will cost considerably more."
wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p6,NO_TITLE,"De Groot et al. (2013) analysed 94 restoration projects globally and found costs varied by several orders of magnitude, but in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems mostly in the range of USD 100–10,000 per hectare. They did, however, estimate that the majority of these projects provided net benefits and should be considered as high-yield investments. Some methods can be much cheaper than others, even in the same type of ecosystems in the same country; the estimated cost of restoring forest cover in Brazil varied between a mean of USD 49 using natural regeneration compared to a mean of USD 2041 per hectare using planting (Brancalion et al., 2019). When assessing costs, it is also important to take into account the benefits delivered by different options, both in economic terms and regarding other wider benefits."
wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p7,NO_TITLE,"The ‘technological’ dimension of feasibility in the context of ecosystems can be regarded as the range of techniques available and the capacity to implement them. As described in Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 above, a wide range of techniques have been developed and are starting to be implemented. There is good evidence to support adaptation for biodiversity and EbA in general terms and, in many cases, adaptation draws on techniques for habitat creation and restoration which have been developed to meet other objectives. However, feasibility needs to be assessed alongside the likely effectiveness: a feasible but ineffective scheme is of no value and the evaluation of success for specific interventions remains poorly developed (Morecroft et al., 2019). It is therefore often important to proceed with the use of pilot studies, good monitoring and the evaluation of outcomes to build confidence before greater deployment of approaches. A linked technical area is the availability of specialist skills and knowledge to implement adaptation; this can vary considerably according to the type of adaptation measure."
wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p8,NO_TITLE,"Institutional dimensions are dealt with more fully in other chapters, but in the specific context of the natural environment it is notable that EbA is relevant to a wide range of organisations and policy objectives, in addition to environmental departments, NGOs and agencies which traditionally deliver conservation. Upscaling implementation is likely to be dependent on this wider range of interests. There can, however, be problems, in that appropriate geographies for decision-making about ecosystems (e.g., a catchment) may not directly map onto governance arrangements."
wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p9,NO_TITLE,"Socio-cultural factors are important for adaptation of the natural environment. Reviewing the constraints of EbA, Nalau et al.

In this respect, adaptation by and for ecosystems should perform well, and this may be a reason to prefer EbA to other approaches when there is an alternative. It should, however, be noted that sometimes apparently environmentally positive approaches such as forest creation can be done in ways which are damaging (Section 2.6.7 and Box 2.2) and the impacts need to be critically assessed for local circumstances."
wg2_ch02_2.6.8 _p11,NO_TITLE,"Geophysical dimensions are important for ecosystems as they have typically shaped which ecosystems can occur where, and feasibility will depend on implementing adaptation options in places where they are appropriate.

wg2_ch02_box-2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"To hold global temperature rise to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C as required by the Paris Agreement requires major changes in land use and management. There are many opportunities for NbS, which can provide climate change mitigation and adaptation in ways that protect and restore biodiversity and provide a wide range of benefits to people (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). There are also new technologies and approaches to develop the bioeconomy in ways which will provide many benefits (Cross-Working Group Box BIOECONOMY in Chapter 5). Nevertheless, renewable energy is a large and essential element of climate change mitigation and there are adverse impacts on biodiversity associated with some types of renewable energy, including wind and solar technologies (Rehbein et al., 2020). However, one of the most serious conflicts emerging is that between land-based approaches to mitigation and the protection of biodiversity, particularly as a result of afforestation strategies and potentially large areas devoted to bioenergy, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It is important to recognise the impacts of climate change mitigation at the same time as assessing the direct impacts of climate change, and ensure that adaptation and mitigation are joined up."
wg2_ch02_box-2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"BECCS is an integral part of all widely accepted pathways to keeping global temperature rise to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018b). This requires large areas of land, which can be in conflict with the need to produce food and protect biodiversity (Smith et al., 2018). One study examined the combined impacts of climate change and LULCC for bioenergy, and found that severe impacts on species were likely if bioenergy was a major component of strategies for climate change mitigation (Hof et al., 2018). A study on the potential impacts of bioenergy production and climate change on European birds found that one scenario for land conversion for bioenergy to meet a 2°C target would have less impact on species range loss than a global temperature increase of 4°C, but noted that if bioenergy were the only mitigation option it would 'very likely result in the negative effects of bioenergy outweighing the positive effects' (Meller et al., 2015). To avoid the worst impacts of BECCS, it will need to be carefully targeted according to context and local conditions, and other mitigation strategies prioritised so that its use can be minimised (IPCC, 2019a; Ohashi et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch02_box-2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Reforestation of previously forested areas can bring multiple benefits, but planting trees in places where they do not naturally grow can have serious environmental impacts, including potentially exacerbating the effects of climate change. Savannas are amongst the ecosystems at risk from afforestation programmes. Savannas are grass-dominated, high-diversity ecosystems with endemic species adapted to high-light environments, herbivory and fire (Staver et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2016). Interactions between climate change, elevated CO2 and the disruption of natural disturbance regimes have led to the widespread encroachment of woody plants (Stevens et al., 2016), causing a fundamental shift in ecosystem structure and function with loss of grass and reduced fire frequency (Archibald et al., 2009) and stream flow (Honda and Durigan, 2016) (Sections 2.4.3.5, 2.5.2.5, Box 2.1, 2.5.4, TAble 2.5, Figure 2.11). Afforestation exacerbates this degradation (Bremer and Farley, 2010; Veldman et al., 2015; Abreu et al., 2017). Global-scale analyses aimed at identifying degraded forest areas suitable for reforestation (Veldman et al., 2019) cannot reliably separate naturally grassy ecosystems with sparse tree cover from degraded forests, so local information is essential to ensure tree planting is targeted where it can benefit most and avoid harm. Figure Box 2.2.1 indicates where these issues are most likely to arise."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Like all living plants, trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. In trees, this carbon uptake is relatively long-term, since much of it is stored in the trees’ woody stems and roots. Therefore, tree planting can be a valuable contribution to reducing climate change. Besides capturing carbon, planting trees can reduce some negative impacts of climate change by providing shade and cooling. It can also help prevent erosion and reduce flood risk by slowing water flow and improving ground water storage. Restoring forest in degraded areas supports biodiversity and can provide benefits to people, ranging from timber to food and recreation."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"There are some areas where replacing lost trees is useful. These include forest that has been recently cut down and where reforestation is usually practical. However, it is very important to correctly identify areas of forest that are degraded or have definitely been deforested. Reforesting places, especially where existing native forest patches occur, brings benefits both in sucking up carbon from the atmosphere and helping us to adapt to climate change. Plantations of a non-native species, although offering some economic benefits, do not usually provide the same range of positive impacts, generally have lower biodiversity, reduced carbon uptake and storage, and are less resilient to climate change."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"Reforestation options include the natural regeneration of the forest, assisted restoration, enrichment planting, native-tree plantations, commercial plantations and directed tree planting in agro-forestry systems and urban areas. Reforestation with native species usually contributes to a wide range of sustainability goals, including biodiversity recovery, improved water filtration and groundwater recharge. It can reduce the risks of soil erosion and floods. In cities, planting trees can support climate change adaptation by reducing the heat of the area, and promote a wide range of social benefits such as providing shade and benefitting outdoor recreation. Urban trees can also lower energy costs by reducing the demand for conventional sources of cooling like air-conditioning, especially during peak-demand periods. It is therefore important to recognise that there are a wide range of different planting and forest management strategies. The choice will depend on the objectives and the location."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"Not everywhere is suitable for tree planting. It is particularly problematic in native non-forested ecosystems. These natural ecosystems are not deforested and degraded but are instead naturally occurring non-forested ecosystems. These areas vary from open grasslands to densely wooded savannas and shrublands. Here, restoring the natural ecosystems instead of afforesting them will better contribute to increasing carbon storage and increasing the area’s resilience to climate change and other environmental changes. It is important to remember that, just because a tree can grow somewhere, it does not mean that it should. These systems are very important in their own right, storing carbon in soils, supporting rich biodiversity and providing people with important ecosystem services such as grasslands for animal grazing. Planting trees in these areas destroys the ecosystem and threatens the biodiversity which is adapted to these environments. They can also impact on ecosystem services such as forage for livestock, on which many people rely."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"Many of these open areas also occur in low-rainfall areas. Planting trees there uses a lot of water and can cause reductions in stream flow and groundwater. Many of these locations also burn regularly, and planting trees threatens the establishing trees but can also increase the intensity of the fires from that of a grass-fuelled fire to that of a wood-fuelled fire. Swapping grassy ecosystems for forests may contribute to warming, as forests absorb more incoming radiation (warmth) than grasslands. Aside from the negative impacts to adaptation, it is also questionable just how much carbon can be sequestered in these landscapes as planting trees in grassy ecosystems can reduce carbon gains. Furthermore, a high below-ground carbon store prevents carbon loss to fire in these fire-prone environments."
wg2_ch02_FAQ 2.6_p7,NO_TITLE,"Another example is peatlands. Peat stores an incredible amount of carbon; maintaining and restoring peatlands is therefore important to reduce atmospheric carbon. However, the restoration actions depend on what type of peatland it is and where it is located. Many temperate and boreal peatlands are naturally treeless. Here, planting trees is often only possible following drainage, but draining and planting (especially of non-native species) destroys native biodiversity and releases GHGs. Many peatlands, especially in the Tropics, are naturally forested, and restoring them requires re-wetting and restoring the natural tree cover (see Figure FAQ2.2.1) which will increase carbon storage."

We can consider  what the ecological, social and economic goals are of tree planting. It is then important to  verify the local context and decide  what restoration action will be most effective.

For example, while it is clear that diseases have altered considerably in both wild animals and humans in some areas (high confidence in detection), there are many regions that are under-studied, and few regions that provide robust assessments of the role of climate change, particularly with respect to human infectious diseases. While wildfire has been robustly linked to climate change in some regions, there are still a lack of attribution studies in some regions that have experienced large burns recently, and only one fire impact—the increase of the area burned by wildfire in western North America in the period 1984–2017 (Section 2.4.4.2.1) —has been formally attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Global changes in soil and freshwater ecosystem carbon over time remain uncertainties in global carbon stocks and changes (Section 2.4.4.4); due to the physical inability to conduct repeat-monitoring and the lack of remote sensing to scale up point measurements, no global methods can yet produce repeating spatial estimates of soil carbon stock changes."

Interactions can be particularly complex for invasive species, pests, pathogens and human infectious diseases. Modelling of risks at the species level requires comprehensive databases of the physiological, life-history, and reproduction of individual species, and modeling the impact of changes in species’ compositions requires a mechanistic understanding of functional traits relevant to ecosystem integrity, functioning and resilience to climate change. Taxa that particularly lack this basis for model projections include fungi and bacteria. For numerous plant and animal species, research into genotypic and phenotypic diversity as a source of ecosystem resilience would inform projections of risk."

Major uncertainties remain in our understanding of soil functions. ESMs predict that soil respiration will increase with rising temperatures (Friedlingstein et al., 2014). However, there is evidence of acclimation post-increase (Carey et al., 2016) as the opposite response of decrease in respiration with warming (Li et al., 2013; Reynolds et al., 2015). Long-term, large-scale field observations combined with a better conceptual understanding of the factors governing soil process responses to climate change are needed.

As detailed in Section 2.6.2, there is a strong body of literature on conceptual approaches to climate change adaptation for biodiversity but very little empirical testing of which approaches actually work best.
