It can be broadly divided into six sub-regions based on geographic position and coastal peripheries (IPCC, 2014b). These are, in alphabetical order, Central Asia (5 countries), East Asia (7 countries/regions), North Asia (2 countries), South Asia (8 countries), Southeast Asia (12 countries) and West Asia (17 countries). The population of Asia was reported to be over 4.46 billion in 2016, which is about 60% of the world’s population with an estimated density of 100 people per square kilometre (UNDESA, 2017). The highest life expectancy at birth is 84 years (Japan) and the lowest is 52 years (Afghanistan) (CIA, 2017). The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranged from US$587 (Afghanistan) to US$81,585 (Macao, SAR, PRC) (IMF, 2018)."

wg2_ch10_10.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Drawing upon a greater number of studies made possible by greater use of advanced research tools, such as remote sensing as well as meticulous modelling of impacts, the Fifth Assessment Report could significantly expand its coverage of pertinent issues (IPCC, 2014c). For example, the discussion on the Himalayas was expanded to cover observed and projected impacts of climate change on tourism (WGII AR5 Section 10.6.2); livelihood assets such as water and food (WGII AR5 Sections 9.3.3.1, 13.3.1.1, 18.5.3, 19.6.3); poverty (WGII AR5 Section 13.3.2.3); culture (WGII AR5 Section 12.3.2); flood risks (WGII AR5 Sections 18.3.1.1, 24.2.1); health risks (WGII AR5 Section 24.4.6.2); and ecosystems (WGII AR5 Section 24.4.2.2; IPCC, 2014b, 2014c)."

wg2_ch10_10.3.1_p1,10.3.1.1 Observed Climate Change ,"Climate characteristics in Asia are diverse covering all climate zones from tropical to polar, including mountain climate. Monsoonal winds and associated precipitation are dominant in South, Southeast and East Asia. Annual mean surface air temperature averaged over the sub-region ranges from coldest in North Asia (–3°C) to warmest in Southeast Asia (25°C) based on JRA-55 (Kobayashi et al., 2015) climatology for 1981–2010. Most of North Asia and higher altitude is underlain by permafrost. West Asia is the driest and Southeast Asia is the wettest, with the annual precipitation averaged over the sub-region ranging about ten times from 220 mm in West Asia to 2570 mm in Southeast Asia based on GPCC (Schamm et al., 2014) climatology for 1981–2010. Indonesia in Southeast Asia has the longest coastline in the world, causing this area (maritime continent) to be the wettest region (Yamanaka et al., 2018). The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region is a biodiversity hotspot (Wester et al., 2019) and also has significant impacts on the Asian climate because of its orographic and thermodynamic effects (Wu et al., 2012)."
wg2_ch10_10.3.1_p2,10.3.1.1 Observed Climate Change ,"Extreme precipitation events and related flooding occur frequently in monsoon Asia (i.e., Southeast, South and East Asia) (Mori et al., 2021b). Tropical cyclones also affect East and South Asia with torrential rain, strong winds and storm surge. Floods and other weather-related hazards are causing thousands of casualties and millions of people are affected each year (CRED/UNISDR, 2019). On the other hand, droughts have long-lasting effects on agriculture and livestock threatening water security in West Asia, Central Asia and northern China (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Adaptation to such extreme events has been limited in Asia."

Elevation-dependent warming (i.e., the warming rate is different across elevation bands is observed in HMA) (medium confidence) (Hock et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019). While there is an overall trend of decreasing glacier mass in HMA, there are some regional differences and even areas with a positive mass balance due to increased precipitation (Wester et al., 2019). Rising temperatures have resulted in an increasing trend of growing-season length. The number of hot days and warm nights continues to increase in all of Asia (high confidence), while cold days and nights are decreasing except in the southern part of Siberia (Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Large increases in temperature extremes are observed in West and Central Asia (high confidence). Temperature increase is causing strong, more frequent and longer heatwaves in South and East Asia. The 2013 East China heatwaves case is such an example (Xia et al., 2016). In 2016 and 2018, extreme warmth was observed in Asia for which an event-attribution study revealed that this would not have been possible without anthropogenic global warming (medium confidence) (Imada et al., 2018; Imada et al., 2019)."

Numbers of strong TCs (maximum winds of 124.93 km h –1 or higher) also show no discernible trend since 1977 when complete wind-speed data near TC centre become available (JMA, 2018). According to Cinco et al. (2016), for TCs in the Philippines there are no significant trends in the annual number of TCs during 1951–2013. Their analysis showed that the Philippines have been affected by fewer TCs above 124.93 km h –1, but affected more by extreme TCs (above 158.11 km h –1). There has been a significant northwestward shift in TC tracks since the 1980s, and a detectable poleward shift since the 1940s in the average latitude where TCs reach their peak intensity in the western North Pacific (medium confidence) (Lee et al., 2020a)."

Their report also summarised that there is increased agreement between coupled model simulations of anthropogenic climate change and observations of changes in ocean heat content (high confidence). Observed SLR around Asia over 1900–2018 is similar to the global mean sea level change of 1.7 mm yr –1, but for the period 1993–2018, the SLR rate increased to 3.65 mm yr –1 in the Indo-Pacific region and 3.53 m yr –1 in the Northwest Pacific, compared with the global value of 3.25 mm yr –1 (Ranasinghe et al., 2021).

Ocean interior (about 150–800 m) pH also shows a decreasing trend with higher rates in the northern than the southern subtropics, which may be due to greater loading of atmospheric CO2 in the former (JMA, 2018)."

Projected surface air temperature changes in the Tibetan Plateau, Central Asia and West Asia are also significant (high confidence) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021). The highest levels of warming for extremely hot days are expected to occur in West and Central Asia with increased dryness of land (high confidence) (SR1.5). Over mountainous regions, elevation-dependent warming will continue (medium confidence) (Hock et al., 2019).

Thawing permafrost presents a problem in northern areas of Asia, particularly Siberia (Parazoo et al., 2018). Temperature rise will be strongest in winter in most regions, while it will be the strongest on summer in the northern part of West Asia and some parts of South Asia where a desert climate prevails (high confidence) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021).

There will be a large increase in flood frequency in these monsoon regions (Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Without further mitigation efforts, this will lead to continued loss of lives and infrastructure. SR1.5 assessed higher risk from heavy precipitation events at 2°C compared with 1.5°C of global warming in East Asia. A large ensemble-modelling study shows that future warming is expected to further increase winter precipitation, and extreme weather events, such as rain-on-snow, will result in an increase in extreme runoff in Japan (low confidence) (Ohba and Kawase, 2020). Furthermore, the earlier snowmelt will affect energy supply by hydropower."
wg2_ch10_10.3.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Monsoon land precipitation likely  will increase in East, Southeast and South Asia mainly due to increasing moisture convergence by elevated temperature (high confidence); however, there is low confidence in the magnitude and detailed spatial patterns of precipitation changes at the sub-regional scale in East Asia (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021). Increasing land–sea thermal contrast and resultant lower tropospheric circulation changes, together with increasing moisture, are projected to intensify the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation (medium confidence). Anthropogenic aerosols greatly modify sub-regional precipitation changes, and their spatio-temporal changes are uncertain (Douville et al., 2021).

In their projection in the case following the RCP8.5 scenario, the regional sea level rises along Honshu Island in Japan during 2081–2100 relative to 1981–2000 are 6–25 cm higher than the global mean SLR due to the dynamic response of the ocean circulation. For the impact assessment of coastal hazards, the total SLR included extreme events due to storm surge and high ocean waves, which are influenced by the changes in TCs (Seneviratne et al., 2021). Mori and Takemi (2016) summarised the characteristics of TCs in the western Pacific in the past and in the future, and the extreme value of significant wave height increased in several regions.

The concentration of population growth in less developed regions means that an increasing number of people live in countries with the least ability to adapt to climate change (Auffhammer and Kahn, 2018). Bangladesh with 163 million people, an example, is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate risks and natural hazards, and faces severe floods, cyclones, droughts, heatwaves and storm surges on a regular basis (Dastagir, 2015; Hossain et al., 2018; Roy and Haider, 2019)."

For instance, in South Asia, extreme climatic conditions are threatening food security; thus, agro-based economies, such as those of India and Pakistan, are the most vulnerable to climate change in this regard (Mendelsohn, 2014; Ahmad, 2015; Kirby et al., 2016; Ali et al., 2017)."

Studies highlight the fact that disasters do not affect people equally; mostly findings show that insufficient disaster education, inadequate protection measures and powerful cultural issues, both pre- and post-disaster, increase women’s vulnerability during and after disasters (Isik et al., 2015; Reyes and Lu, 2016; Hamidazada et al., 2019). In particular, cultural issues play a role after disasters by affecting women’s security, access to disaster aid and health care (Raju, 2019).

The relationship between economic outcomes and cross-sectional climate variation is confounded by regional heterogeneity, including historical effects of settlement and colonisation (Dell et al., 2014; Newell et al., 2018). Climate change vulnerability may also depend on sufficient employment opportunities in the risk-prone areas, land-holding size, gender, education level, and family and community size, as observed in Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam (Baul and McDonald, 2015; Lebel L., 2015; Phuong et al., 2018a)."

Most of these cities are located in the low-fertility countries of Asia, where overall population sizes are stagnant or declining, as observed in a few cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea (e.g., Nagasaki and Busan), which experienced a population decline between 2000 and 2018 (United Nations, 2019). By 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants, most of them in developing regions. However, some of the fastest-growing urban agglomerations are cities with fewer than 1 million inhabitants, many of them located in Asia and Africa (United Nations, 2019). Challenges with water supply, in many cases, have existed for decades (Dasgupta, 2015). Climate change increases these challenges (Hoque et al., 2016).

In contrast, India and ASEAN rely more on coal since coal may meet their soaring energy demand. Accordingly, more than 80% of the global coal will be consumed in Asia by 2050.

This tendency is especially remarkable for ASEAN, which will become a net importer in the early 2020s. The self-sufficiency rate of coal will be maintained at a level of 80%, while that of oil and natural gas will decline significantly. The additional oil imports of the emerging Asian economies will be from North America, the Middle East and North Africa. The main players in Asia for the liquefied natural gas imports will extend from Japan and Republic of Korea to China and India.

Similarly, energy systems are influenced by the way the agriculture sector, mainly in Al Mashrek, relies increasingly on energy-intensive methods (e.g., more fertilisers, different irrigation and harvesting patterns) (Farajalla, 2013)."

Such demands in summer seasons will by far exceed any energy savings from the decrease in heating demand due to warmer winters. Higher demand for cooling due to hotter temperatures has become a major challenge in the energy sector in all countries. Furthermore, decreased water levels due to lower precipitation reduces hydroelectric output. This is particularly the case for countries such as Syria and Iraq with large hydroelectric capacity (Hamid and Raouf, 2009).

Extreme weather events could generate grave damage to power plants, most being located only a few metres above sea level, as well as power-transmission towers and lines. In Lebanon, a small country where there are no Indigenous energy resources, the disruption of shipping of fuel supplies due to extreme weather events is a major risk. Other extreme weather events, such as floods and sandstorms, expose energy and industrial systems in the coastal areas due to a rise in sea level. Countries of the Arabian Peninsula are projected to experience significant inland flooding as sea levels rise (Hamid and Raouf, 2009).

Countries such as Lebanon and Jordan have already made progress in mainstreaming CCA into electricity infrastructure. In the UAE, buildings account for more than 80% of the total electricity consumption. There are currently a set of measures and regulations on building conditions and specifications that are being applied to increase energy efficiency in buildings, but the rehabilitation and upgrading of old buildings still require further efforts (Environment, 2015). In Kuwait, one adaptation measure to dust storms is through the reduction of the proportion of open-desert land from 75 to 51%, the increase in protected areas from 8 to 18% and greenbelt projects in desert areas (Kuwait, 2015). Addressing climate-change impact on energy systems in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Palestine needs to simultaneously consider other interlinked challenges of population growth, rapid urbanisation, refugee influx, conflict and geopolitical location.

Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia see significant disaster-associated displacements: for example, heavy rain-induced flooding in Khatlon (Tajikistan) triggered 5400 new displacements; landslides in the Jalal-Abad (Kyrgyzstan) saw 4700 new displacements; and floods in Altai, Tuva and Khakassia (Russia) displaced 1500 people. Iran reported the highest sub-regional figures with >520,000 new disaster-related displacements in 2019 (IDMC, 2019). In Southeast and East Asia, cyclones, floods and typhoons triggered internal displacement of 9.6 million people in 2019, almost 30% of total global displacements (IDMC, 2019). With most migrants in the region being temporary migrant workers, loss of jobs and wages among them have been particularly severe due to adverse economic climate triggered by COVID-19 (ESCWA, 2020).

In South Asia, migration hotspots include the Gangetic Plain and the Delhi–Lahore corridor, and coastal cities such as Chennai, Chittagong, Dhaka and Mumbai, which will be simultaneously exposed to climate-change impacts, major migration destinations and amplified rural–urban migration (Ober, 2019). Importantly, there is low agreement  on projected numbers (see Boas et al., 2019) with uncertainties around how local policies and individual behaviours will shape migration choices.

Financial remittances help vulnerable households spread risk through better incomes, expanded networks and improved assets such as housing, education and communication technology (Jha et al., 2018; Szabo et al., 2018; Ober, 2019; Maharjan et al., 2020). Benefits from international remittances across the Asia Pacific region were approximately 276 billion USD in 2017 (UN, 2018), and in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Nepal remittances were ~25% of the national GDP in 2015. However, migration requires a minimum level of resources, and liquidity constraints impede internal migration by the poorest households often rendering them immobile (Ayeb-Karlsson et al., 2020; Maharjan et al., 2020). Furthermore, migration does not necessarily mean that people move out of risk; in fact, often they might be subjected to new risks. Notably, migrants in South and Southeast Asia have been severely affected by the compounding crises of disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is emerging evidence that inclusion of universal safety-net provisions that embed adaptation planning can reduce vulnerabilities of migrants (Sengupta and Jha, 2020; Cundill et al., 2021; Sultana, 2021)."

Across Asia, international and internal migration are changing social norms and household structures, with significant implications for local adaptive capacity (Singh, 2019; Evertsen and van der Geest, 2020; Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020; Rao et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.2_p1,10.4.2.1 Observed Impacts ,"Sub-regional diversity of ecosystems is high in Asia (Section 10.2.2). Climate-impact drivers of Asian terrestrial ecosystems (ATS) change are global warming, precipitation and Asian monsoon alteration, permafrost thawing and extreme events like dust storms. Observed and projected changes in ATS are affected by several interacting factors. Non-climatic human-related drivers are change of land use, change of human use of natural resources, including species and ecosystems overexploitation as well as other non-sustainable use, socioeconomic changes and direct impacts of rising greenhouse gases (GHGs). Ecosystem vulnerability has resulted from complex interactions of CIDs and non-climate drivers. Species interaction and natural variability of organisms, species and ecosystems is currently poorly understood, and much more work still needs to be done to unravel these multiple stressors (i.e., Berner et al., 2013; Brazhnik and Shugart, 2015)."

In Central Siberia, the changes in climate and disturbance regimes are shifting the southern taiga ecotone northward (Brazhnik et al., 2017). In Taimyr, no significant changes in the forest boundary have been observed during the past three decades (Pospelova et al., 2017). For the Japanese archipelago, it is suggested that the change in tree community composition along the temperature gradient is a response to past and/or current climate changes (Suzuki et al., 2015)."

Since AR5, in North Asia new evidence has appeared of tree expansion into mountain tundra and steppe, of intensive reproduction and increase in tree stands productivity in the past 30–100 years at the upper treeline in the Ural Mountains (Shiyatov and Mazepa, 2015; Zolotareva and Zolotarev, 2017; Moiseev et al., 2018; Sannikov et al., 2018; Fomin et al., 2020; Gaisin et al., 2020), in the Russian Altai Mountains (Kharuk et al., 2017a; Cazzolla Gatti et al., 2019) and in the Putorana Mountains (Kirdyanov et al., 2012; Pospelova et al., 2017; Grigor’ev et al., 2019). Lower treelines in the southernmost Larix sibirica forests in the Saur Mountains, eastern Kazakhstan, have suffered from increased drought stress in recent decades causing forest regeneration and tree growth decrease, and tree mortality increase (Dulamsuren et al., 2013). In Jeju Island, Republic of Korea, recent warming has enhanced Quercus mongolica growth at its higher distribution and has led to Abies koreana (ABKO) growth reduction at all elevations, except the highest locality. Thus, the combination of warming, increasing competition and frequent tropical cyclone disturbances could lead to population decline or even extinction of ABKO at Jeju Island (Altman et al., 2020). In the Himalaya, the treeline over recent decades either moves upwards (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Suwal et al., 2016; Sigdel et al., 2018; Tiwari and Jha, 2018) or does not show upslope advance (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Gaire et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018c), or moves downwards (Bhatta et al., 2018). In the Tibetan Plateau, the treeline either shifted upwards or showed no significant upwards shift (Wang et al., 2019c). This can be explained by site-specific complex interaction of positive effect of warming on tree growth, and negative effects of drought stress, change in snow precipitation, inter- and intraspecific interactions of trees and shrubs, land-use change (especially grazing) and other factors (Liang et al., 2014; Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Tiwari et al., 2017; Sigdel et al., 2018; Tiwari and Jha, 2018; Sigdel et al., 2020). It is largely unknown how broader-scale climate inputs, such as pre-monsoon droughts, interact with local-scale factors to govern treeline response patterns (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Müller et al., 2016; Bhatta et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019b)."

The climatic range of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) in 1991–2010 expanded east- and northward in Siberia and the Russian Far East compared with the 1951–1970 range (Popova, 2014). The climatic range of Ixodes ricinus, a vector of dangerous human diseases, expanded into Central Asia and south of the Russian Far East (Semenov et al., 2020). A butterfly (Melanargia russiae) in the Middle Urals moved northward (Zakharova et al., 2017). Thrush birds in West Siberia penetrated northward up to the limits of the sparse woodlands (Ryzhanovskiy, 2019a). The increase in the length of frost-free period observed in the Ilmen Nature Reserve, Middle Urals, during recent decades is supposed to be interlinked with changes in the amplitude and frequency of population waves of bank vole (Kiseleva, 2020). In Katunskiy Biosphere Reserve, Russian Altai, in the period 2005–2015, alpine plant species have shifted towards higher altitudes by 5.3 m on average (Artemov, 2018). Wild reindeer herds in Taimyr, north of Central Siberia, migrated northward to the Arctic Sea coast in hot summers between 1999–2003 and 2009–2016 because of an earlier massive emergence of bloodsucking insects (Pospelova et al., 2017). In Yakutia, the ranges of red deer, elk and the northern pika are expanding, and the winter survival of the mouse-like rodents has increased (Safronov, 2016). In the Chukchi Sea, in recent decades the average duration polar bears spent onshore increased by 30 d (Rode et al., 2015b) in line with global warming and the rapid decline of their sea ice habitat (Derocher et al., 2013; Jenssen et al., 2015; Rode et al., 2015a)."

The present distribution of Asian black birch (Betula davuricaPall.) in East and North Asia was formed as a result of northward expansion during post-Last Glacial Maximum global warming (Shitara et al., 2018). Both upper and lower limits of avifauna of two New Guinean mountains, Mt. Karimui and Karkar Island, have been shifting upslope since 1965 (Freeman and Freeman, 2014). In Republic of Korea, for the past 60 years, the northern boundary line of 63 southern butterfly species has moved further north (Bae et al., 2020). The change in the butterflies’ occurrence in this period has been influenced mostly by large-scale reforestation, not by climate change (Kwon et al., 2021). Warming-driven geographic range shift was recorded in 87% of 124 endemic plant species studied in the Sikkim Himalaya in the periods 1849–1850 and 2007–2010 (Telwala et al., 2013).

Climate change has shown significant impacts on subalpine plant species at low altitudes and latitudes in Republic of Korea and may impose a big threat to these plant species (Adhikari et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019c).

Climate warming has enhanced the competitive ability of the native species (Sparganium angustifolium) against the invasive species (Egeria densa) in China under a mesocosm experiment in a greenhouse (Yu et al., 2018e). It has also increased the non-target effect on a native plant (Alternanthera sessilis) by a biological control beetle (Agasicles hygrophila) in China due to range expansion of the beetle and change of phenology of the plant (Lu et al., 2015). Climate warming has expanded the distribution of invasive bamboos (Phyllostachys edulis and P. bambusoides) northward and upslope in Japan (Takano et al., 2017), while soil dry-down rates have been a key driver of invasion of dwarf bamboo (Sasa kurilensis) in central Hokkaido above and below the treeline (Winkler et al., 2016)."

In the fir forest ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau, winter warming affects the ammonia-oxidising bacteria and archaea, thus altering the nitrogen cycle (Huang et al., 2016). Ecosystem carbon pool in the spruce forests of the northeast Tibetan Plateau was reduced by about 25% by deforestation due to recent decades of climate warming as well as wood pasture and logging (Wagner et al., 2015). In Mongolia’s forest steppe, recent decades of drought- and land-use-induced deforestation has reduced the ecosystem carbon stock density by about 40% (Dulamsuren et al., 2016). In Inner Mongolia, the predicted decreases in precipitation and warming for most of the temperate grassland region could lead to a pH change, which would contribute to a soil C-N-P decoupling that could reduce plant growth and production in arid ecosystems (Jiao et al., 2016)."

wg2_ch10_10.4.2.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change, human activity and lightning determine increases in wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia (high detection with medium-to-low attribution to climate change). In North Asia, the extent of fire-affected areas in boreal forest can be millions of hectares in a single extreme fire year (Duane et al., 2021) and nearly doubled between 1970 and 1990 (Brazhnik et al., 2017). During recent decades, the number, area and frequency of forest fires increased in Putorana Plateau (north of Central Siberia), in larch-dominated forests of Central Siberia and in Siberian forests as a whole. This increase is in line with an increase in the average annual air temperature, air temperature anomalies, droughts and the length of fire season (Ponomarev et al., 2016; Kharuk and Ponomarev, 2017; Pospelova et al., 2017). The number of forest fires and damaged areas in Gangwon Province and the Yeongdong area in the 2000s increased by factors of 1.7 and 5.6, respectively, compared with the 1990s (Bae et al., 2020). Climate change is not the sole cause of the increase in forest fire severity (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2018d). Ignition is often facilitated by lightning (Canadell et al., 2021), and over 80% of fires in Siberia are likely  anthropogenic in origin (e.g., (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Gas field development and Indigenous tundra burning practices that may get out of control contribute to fire frequency in the forest–tundra of West Siberia (Adaev, 2018; Moskovchenko et al., 2020). Climate change in combination with socioeconomic changes has resulted in an increase in fire severity and area burned in South Siberia, and illegal logging increases fire danger in forest–steppe Scots pine stands (Ivanova et al., 2010; Schaphoff et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.2.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"In East and North Asia, satellite measurements and ground-based observations in recent decades demonstrate either an increase in the length of plant growth season over sub-regions or in some territories in line with climate warming, or do not show any significant trend in other territories (high confidence). In recent decades in China, there has been an increasing trend in annual mean grassland net primary production (NPP), average leaf area index and lengthening of the local growing season (Piao et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017b; Xia et al., 2019). Nevertheless, phenology patterns vary across different studies, species and parts of China. In most regions of Northeast China, start date and length of land surface phenology from 2000 to 2015 had advanced by approximately 1 d yr −1, except in the needle-leaf and cropland areas (Zhang et al., 2017d). For Inner Mongolia, it has been shown that neither the start of growing season (SOS) nor the end of growing season (EOS) presented detectable progressive patterns at the regional level in 1998–2012, except for the steppe–desert (6% of the total area) (Sha et al., 2016). In the Tianshan Mountains in China, the NPP of only 2 out of 12 types of vegetation increased in spring, and the NPP of only one type increased in autumn from 2000–2003 to 2012–2016 (Hao et al., 2019). In Republic of Korea, from 1970 to 2013, the SOS has advanced by 2.7 d per decade, and the EOS has been delayed by 1.4 d per decade (Jung et al., 2015). During the past decade, leaf unfolding has accelerated at a rate of 1.37 d yr −1, and the timing of leaf fall has been delayed at a rate of 0.34 d yr −1 (Kim et al., 2019d). Cherry blossoms are predicted to flower 6.3 and 11.2 d earlier after 2090 according to scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Bae et al., 2020). On the Tibetan Plateau, it was found that the SOS has advanced and the EOS has been delayed over the past 30–40 years (Yang et al., 2017). Using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets and ground-based Budburst data (Wang et al., 2017c) found no consistent evidence that the SOS has been advancing or delaying over the Tibetan Plateau during the past two to three decades. The discrepancies among different studies in the trends of spring phenology over the Tibetan Plateau could be largely attributed to the use of different phenology retrieval methods. An uncertainty exists with the relationship between land-surface phenology and climate change estimated by satellite-derived NDVI because these indices are usually composite products of a number of days (e.g., 16 d) that could fail to capture more details. Besides, due to lack of in situ observations, the SOS and EOS at large areas cannot be easy defined (Zhang et al., 2017d)."

In Mongolia and Kazakhstan, the temperature increase over the previous decade promoted radial stem increment of the Siberian larch. However, the simultaneous influence of increased temperature, decreased precipitation and increased anthropogenic pressure resulted in widespread declines in forest productivity and reduced forest regeneration, and increased tree mortality (Dulamsuren et al., 2013; Lkhagvadorj et al., 2013a; Lkhagvadorj et al., 2013b; Dulamsuren et al., 2014; Khansaritoreh et al., 2017). In Eastern Taimyr, growing season, the number of flowering shoots, annual increment, success of seed ripening and vegetation biomass have increased considerably in recent decades (Pospelova et al., 2017). In Vishera Nature Reserve, northern Ural Mountains, annual temperature has increased in recent decades in parallel with a summer temperature drop and an increase in summer frost numbers. As a result, trends in vegetation change are mostly unreliable (Prokosheva, 2017)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.2.1.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"In Asia, the date of arrival of migrant birds to nesting areas and the date of departure from winter areas are changing consistently with climate change (medium confidence). Time of arrival of the grey crow to the Lower Ob river region, northwest Siberia, shifted to earlier dates in the period 1970–2017, which is consistent with an increase in the daily average temperatures on the day of arrival (Ryzhanovskiy, 2019b). In Ilmen Nature Reserve, Urals, an earlier arrival of the majority of nesting bird species has not been observed in recent decades. This is explained by the fact that other factors, such as the weather of each spring month of particular years, population density in the previous nesting period, the seed yield of the main feeding plants and migration of wintering species from adjacent areas, determinate the long-term dynamics of bird arrival (Zakharov, 2016; Zakharov, 2018). In Yokohama, Japan, observations since 1986 have revealed that the arrival of six winter bird species came later and the departure earlier than in the past, due to warmer temperatures (Kobori et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2018). Some papers corroborate that earlier start and later end of phenological events in Asia are associated with global warming; however, other papers do not confirm such a connection. Comparison and synthesis of results is impeded by usage of different metrics, measurement methods and models (e.g., Hao et al., 2019).

Northward shift and area change of bioclimatic zones in Siberia (Anisimov et al., 2017; Torzhkov et al., 2019) and northeast Asia (Choi et al., 2019) are projected. Projected changes in vegetation in China at the end of the 21st century reveal that the area covered by cold–dry potential vegetation decreases as the area covered by warm–humid potential vegetation increases (Zhao et al., 2017a). Forest expansion into mountain tundra of the northern Urals is expected (Sannikov et al., 2018). In Republic of Korea, projected under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in the 2070s, suitable area loss of six subalpine tree species, namely, Korean fir, Khingan fir, Sargent juniper, Yeddo spruce, Korean yew and Korean arborvitae, range from 17.7 ± 20.1% to 65.2 ± 34.7%, respectively (Lee et al., 2021b). Korean fir forests would be replaced by temperate forests at lower elevations, while they would continuously persist at the highest elevations on Mt. Halla, Jeju Island and Republic of Korea (Lim et al., 2018). Himalayan birch at its upper distribution boundary either is projected to move upwards (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Bobrowski et al., 2018) or considered to downslope as a response to global-change-type droughts (Liang et al., 2014). Upwards shift in elevation of bioclimatic zones, decreases in area of the highest elevation zones and large expansion of the lower tropical and sub-tropical zones can be expected by the year 2050 throughout the transboundary Kailash Sacred Landscape of China, India and Nepal, and likely  within the Himalayan region more generally (Zomer et al., 2014)."

(2013) also project a positive northward shift of vegetation boundaries for the greater part of West Siberia in line with warming; however, no shift for the north of West Siberia and negative shift for the southern Urals and northwest Kazakhstan are projected for 2046–2065. The replacement of forest–steppe with steppe at the lower treeline in South Siberia is projected (Brazhnik and Shugart, 2015), and retreat of larch forests from the southernmost strongholds of boreal forest in eastern Kazakhstan is expected as part of a global process of forest dieback in semiarid regions (Dulamsuren et al., 2013). In North Asia, tree growth is intertwined with permafrost, snowpack, insect outbreaks, wildfires, seed dispersal and climate (e.g., Klinge et al., 2018). It is challenging to isolate the affects of individual factors, particularly since they can interact on one another in unanticipated ways because the underlying mechanisms are not well understood (Berner et al., 2013; Brazhnik and Shugart, 2015). The accuracy of treeline-shift projections is limited because projections are based on vegetation models which do not consider all the factors (Tishkov et al., 2020). The regional vegetation model structure and parameterisation can affect model performance, and the corresponding projections can differ significantly (Shuman et al., 2015)."

In East Asia, Cunninghamia lanceolate, a fast-growing and widely distributed coniferous timber species in China, is projected to increase distribution, to decrease the establishment probability and to reduce total NPP by the 2050s (Liu et al., 2014c). In the monsoon regions of Asia, by the end of the 21st century, NPP is projected to increase by 9–45% (Ito et al., 2016).

It is expected that under projected warming, fig species in China will expand to higher latitudes and altitudes (Chen et al., 2018c). In Japan, under the A1B scenario, 89% of the area currently covered by the Fagus crenata-dominant forest type will be replaced by Quercus spp.-dominant forest types (Matsui et al., 2018). Current trends of climate change will reduce distribution of tall (2–2.5 m high) herb communities in Japan, and will increase suitably for them in the Russian Far East (Korznikov et al., 2019). A range expansion of Lobaria pindarensis, an endemic epiphytic lichen in the HKH region, is projected to move to the northeast and to higher altitudes in response to climate change, although the species’ low dispersal abilities and the local availability of trees as a substratum will considerably limit latitudinal and altitudinal shifts (Devkota et al., 2019)."

All four RCP scenarios showed north-ward expansion of vulnerable regions to pine wilt disease in China, Republic of Korea, the Russian Far East and Japan under climate conditions in 2070 (Hirata et al., 2017), and during 2026–2050 in Japan (Matsuhashi et al., 2020). It is noteworthy that disease expansion depends not only on climatic factors but also on the dispersal capacity of insect vectors, the transportation of infected logs to non-infected regions and the susceptibility of host trees (e.g., Gruffudd et al., 2016). The suitable habitat area of the snow leopard Panthera uncia is projected to increase by 20% under the IPCC Scenario A1B by 2080: for the seven northernmost snow leopard range states (Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia) the suitable habitat area will increase, while habitat loss is expected on the southern slope of the Himalaya and the southeast Tibetan Plateau (Farrington and Li, 2016). Climate change projected under four RCP scenarios will not affect the distribution patterns of Turkestan Rock Agama Paralaudakia lehmanni (Nikolsky 1896; Sancholi, 2018). In Iran, among 37 studied species of plants and animals, the ranges of 30 species are expected to shrink and ranges of 7 species are expected to increase between 2030 and 2099 under climate-change stress (Yousefi et al., 2019)."

wg2_ch10_10.4.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Under regional projections for North Asia, warmer climate will increase forest fire severity by the late 21st century (medium confidence). For the southern taiga in Tuva Republic, Central Siberia, in a warmer climate, both the annual area burned and fire intensity will increase by 2100. For the central taiga in the Irkutsk region, the annual area burned as well as crown fire-to-ground fire ratiowill increase by the late 21st century compared with the historical (1960–1990) estimate. This moves forest composition towards greater contribution of hardwoods (e.g., Betula spp., Populus spp.) (Brazhnik et al., 2017). This shifting was also proved by observations in northern Mongolia, where boreal forest fires likely  promote the relative dominance of B. platyphylla and threaten the existence of the evergreen conifers, Picea obovata and Pinus sibirica (Otoda et al., 2013). For Tuva Republic, warming ambient temperatures increase the potential evapotranspiration demands on vegetation, but if no concurrent increase in precipitation occurs, vegetation becomes stressed and either dies from temperature-based drought stress or more easily succumbs to insects, fire, pathogens or wind throw (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Although Torzhkov et al. (2019) also projected fire risk (FR) increase in Tuva Republic, they expect FR decrease in the Irkutsk region and Yakutia under RCP8.5, and FR decrease in major parts of Central and East Siberia under RCP4.5 for 2090–2099. This discrepancy is due to differences in models, climate projections, fire severity metrics and other assumptions.

wg2_ch10_10.4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Both natural and managed ecosystems, ecosystem services and livelihoods in Asia will potentially be substantially impacted by changing climate (Wu et al., 2018d). There will be increased risk for biodiversity, particularly many endemic and threatened species of fauna and flora already under environmental pressure from land-use change and other regional and global processes (Zomer et al., 2014; Rashid et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2019). Biomes shift not only serves as a signal of climate change but also provides important information for resources management and ecotone ecosystem conservation. A widespread upwards encroachment of subalpine forests would displace regionally unique alpine tundra habitats and possibly cause the loss of alpine species (Schickhoff et al., 2015). In North Asia, emissions from fires reduce forests’ ability to regulate climate. A warmer and longer growing season will increase vulnerability to fires, although fires can be attributed both to climate warming and to other human and natural influences. Recent field-based observations revealed that the forests in South Siberia are losing their ability to regenerate after fire and other landscape disturbances under a warming climate (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Data support the hypothesis of a climate-driven increase in fire frequency in boreal forests with the possible turning of boreal forests from a carbon sink to a carbon source (Ponomarev et al., 2016; Schaphoff et al., 2016; Brazhnik et al., 2017; Ponomarev et al., 2018); however, warming resulting from forest fire is partly offset by cooling in response to increased surface albedo of burned areas in a snow-on period (Chen and Loboda, 2018; Chen et al., 2018a; Jia et al., 2019; Lasslop et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Modelling of the interactions between climate-induced vegetation shifts, wildfire and human activities can provide keys to how people in Asia may be able to adapt to climate change (Kicklighter et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2020). Conservation and sustainable development would benefit from being tailored and modified considering the changing climatic conditions and shifting biomes, mountain belts and species ranges (Pörtner et al., 2021). Expanding the nature reserves would help species conservation; to facilitate species movements across climatic gradients, an increase in landscape connectivity can be elaborated by setting up habitat corridors between nature reserves and along elevational and other climatic gradients (Brito-Morales et al., 2018; D’Aloia et al., 2019; United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, 2019). Assisted migration of species should be considered for isolated habitats as mountain summits or where movements are constrained by poor dispersal ability. Introducing seeds of the species to new regions will help to protect them from the extinction risk caused by climate change (Mazangi et al., 2016). In Asian boreal forests, a strategy and integrated programmes should be developed for adaptation of the forests to global climate change, including sustainable forest management, firefighting infrastructure and forest fuel management, afforestation, as well as institutional, social and other measures in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 ‘Life on Land’ (Isaev and Korovin, 2013; Kattsov and Semenov, 2014; Bae et al., 2020). Improvements in forest habitat quality can reduce the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Choi et al., 2021). Adaptation options for freshwater ecosystems in Asia include increasing connectivity in river networks, expanding protected areas, restoring hydrological processes of wetlands and rivers, creating shade to lower temperatures for vulnerable species, assisted translocation and migration of species (Hassan et al., 2020; Chapter 2). Reduction of non-climate anthropogenic impacts can enhance the adaptive capacity of ecosystems (Tchebakova et al., 2016)."

In Central Siberia, the changes in climate and disturbance regimes are shifting the southern taiga ecotone northward (Brazhnik et al., 2017). In Taimyr, no significant changes in the forest boundary have been observed during the past three decades (Pospelova et al., 2017).

Since AR5, in North Asia new evidence has appeared of tree expansion into mountain tundra and steppe, of intensive reproduction and increase in tree stands productivity in the past 30–100 years at the upper treeline in the Ural Mountains (Shiyatov and Mazepa, 2015; Zolotareva and Zolotarev, 2017; Moiseev et al., 2018; Sannikov et al., 2018; Fomin et al., 2020; Gaisin et al., 2020), in the Russian Altai Mountains (Kharuk et al., 2017a; Cazzolla Gatti et al., 2019) and in the Putorana Mountains (Kirdyanov et al., 2012; Pospelova et al., 2017; Grigor’ev et al., 2019). Lower treelines in the southernmost Larix sibirica forests in the Saur Mountains, eastern Kazakhstan, have suffered from increased drought stress in recent decades causing forest regeneration and tree growth decrease, and tree mortality increase (Dulamsuren et al., 2013). In Jeju Island, Republic of Korea, recent warming has enhanced Quercus mongolica growth at its higher distribution and has led to Abies koreana (ABKO) growth reduction at all elevations, except the highest locality. Thus, the combination of warming, increasing competition and frequent tropical cyclone disturbances could lead to population decline or even extinction of ABKO at Jeju Island (Altman et al., 2020). In the Himalaya, the treeline over recent decades either moves upwards (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Suwal et al., 2016; Sigdel et al., 2018; Tiwari and Jha, 2018) or does not show upslope advance (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Gaire et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018c), or moves downwards (Bhatta et al., 2018). In the Tibetan Plateau, the treeline either shifted upwards or showed no significant upwards shift (Wang et al., 2019c). This can be explained by site-specific complex interaction of positive effect of warming on tree growth, and negative effects of drought stress, change in snow precipitation, inter- and intraspecific interactions of trees and shrubs, land-use change (especially grazing) and other factors (Liang et al., 2014; Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Tiwari et al., 2017; Sigdel et al., 2018; Tiwari and Jha, 2018; Sigdel et al., 2020). It is largely unknown how broader-scale climate inputs, such as pre-monsoon droughts, interact with local-scale factors to govern treeline response patterns (Schickhoff et al., 2015; Müller et al., 2016; Bhatta et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019b)."

The climatic range of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) in 1991–2010 expanded east- and northward in Siberia and the Russian Far East compared with the 1951–1970 range (Popova, 2014). The climatic range of Ixodes ricinus, a vector of dangerous human diseases, expanded into Central Asia and south of the Russian Far East (Semenov et al., 2020). A butterfly (Melanargia russiae) in the Middle Urals moved northward (Zakharova et al., 2017). Thrush birds in West Siberia penetrated northward up to the limits of the sparse woodlands (Ryzhanovskiy, 2019a). The increase in the length of frost-free period observed in the Ilmen Nature Reserve, Middle Urals, during recent decades is supposed to be interlinked with changes in the amplitude and frequency of population waves of bank vole (Kiseleva, 2020). In Katunskiy Biosphere Reserve, Russian Altai, in the period 2005–2015, alpine plant species have shifted towards higher altitudes by 5.3 m on average (Artemov, 2018). Wild reindeer herds in Taimyr, north of Central Siberia, migrated northward to the Arctic Sea coast in hot summers between 1999–2003 and 2009–2016 because of an earlier massive emergence of bloodsucking insects (Pospelova et al., 2017). In Yakutia, the ranges of red deer, elk and the northern pika are expanding, and the winter survival of the mouse-like rodents has increased (Safronov, 2016). In the Chukchi Sea, in recent decades the average duration polar bears spent onshore increased by 30 d (Rode et al., 2015b) in line with global warming and the rapid decline of their sea ice habitat (Derocher et al., 2013; Jenssen et al., 2015; Rode et al., 2015a)."

The present distribution of Asian black birch (Betula davuricaPall.) in East and North Asia was formed as a result of northward expansion during post-Last Glacial Maximum global warming (Shitara et al., 2018). Both upper and lower limits of avifauna of two New Guinean mountains, Mt. Karimui and Karkar Island, have been shifting upslope since 1965 (Freeman and Freeman, 2014). In Republic of Korea, for the past 60 years, the northern boundary line of 63 southern butterfly species has moved further north (Bae et al., 2020). The change in the butterflies’ occurrence in this period has been influenced mostly by large-scale reforestation, not by climate change (Kwon et al., 2021).

In North Asia, the extent of fire-affected areas in boreal forest can be millions of hectares in a single extreme fire year (Duane et al., 2021) and nearly doubled between 1970 and 1990 (Brazhnik et al., 2017). During recent decades, the number, area and frequency of forest fires increased in Putorana Plateau (north of Central Siberia), in larch-dominated forests of Central Siberia and in Siberian forests as a whole. This increase is in line with an increase in the average annual air temperature, air temperature anomalies, droughts and the length of fire season (Ponomarev et al., 2016; Kharuk and Ponomarev, 2017; Pospelova et al., 2017). The number of forest fires and damaged areas in Gangwon Province and the Yeongdong area in the 2000s increased by factors of 1.7 and 5.6, respectively, compared with the 1990s (Bae et al., 2020). Climate change is not the sole cause of the increase in forest fire severity (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2018d). Ignition is often facilitated by lightning (Canadell et al., 2021), and over 80% of fires in Siberia are likely  anthropogenic in origin (e.g., (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Gas field development and Indigenous tundra burning practices that may get out of control contribute to fire frequency in the forest–tundra of West Siberia (Adaev, 2018; Moskovchenko et al., 2020).

Nevertheless, phenology patterns vary across different studies, species and parts of China. In most regions of Northeast China, start date and length of land surface phenology from 2000 to 2015 had advanced by approximately 1 d yr −1, except in the needle-leaf and cropland areas (Zhang et al., 2017d). For Inner Mongolia, it has been shown that neither the start of growing season (SOS) nor the end of growing season (EOS) presented detectable progressive patterns at the regional level in 1998–2012, except for the steppe–desert (6% of the total area) (Sha et al., 2016). In the Tianshan Mountains in China, the NPP of only 2 out of 12 types of vegetation increased in spring, and the NPP of only one type increased in autumn from 2000–2003 to 2012–2016 (Hao et al., 2019). In Republic of Korea, from 1970 to 2013, the SOS has advanced by 2.7 d per decade, and the EOS has been delayed by 1.4 d per decade (Jung et al., 2015). During the past decade, leaf unfolding has accelerated at a rate of 1.37 d yr −1, and the timing of leaf fall has been delayed at a rate of 0.34 d yr −1 (Kim et al., 2019d). Cherry blossoms are predicted to flower 6.3 and 11.2 d earlier after 2090 according to scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Bae et al., 2020). On the Tibetan Plateau, it was found that the SOS has advanced and the EOS has been delayed over the past 30–40 years (Yang et al., 2017). Using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets and ground-based Budburst data (Wang et al., 2017c) found no consistent evidence that the SOS has been advancing or delaying over the Tibetan Plateau during the past two to three decades. The discrepancies among different studies in the trends of spring phenology over the Tibetan Plateau could be largely attributed to the use of different phenology retrieval methods. An uncertainty exists with the relationship between land-surface phenology and climate change estimated by satellite-derived NDVI because these indices are usually composite products of a number of days (e.g., 16 d) that could fail to capture more details. Besides, due to lack of in situ observations, the SOS and EOS at large areas cannot be easy defined (Zhang et al., 2017d)."

In Ilmen Nature Reserve, Urals, an earlier arrival of the majority of nesting bird species has not been observed in recent decades. This is explained by the fact that other factors, such as the weather of each spring month of particular years, population density in the previous nesting period, the seed yield of the main feeding plants and migration of wintering species from adjacent areas, determinate the long-term dynamics of bird arrival (Zakharov, 2016; Zakharov, 2018). In Yokohama, Japan, observations since 1986 have revealed that the arrival of six winter bird species came later and the departure earlier than in the past, due to warmer temperatures (Kobori et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2018). Some papers corroborate that earlier start and later end of phenological events in Asia are associated with global warming; however, other papers do not confirm such a connection. Comparison and synthesis of results is impeded by usage of different metrics, measurement methods and models (e.g., Hao et al., 2019).

In South Siberia, Brazhnik and Shugart (2015) projected a shift from the boreal forest to the steppe biome. Rumiantsev et al. (2013) also project a positive northward shift of vegetation boundaries for the greater part of West Siberia in line with warming; however, no shift for the north of West Siberia and negative shift for the southern Urals and northwest Kazakhstan are projected for 2046–2065. The replacement of forest–steppe with steppe at the lower treeline in South Siberia is projected (Brazhnik and Shugart, 2015), and retreat of larch forests from the southernmost strongholds of boreal forest in eastern Kazakhstan is expected as part of a global process of forest dieback in semiarid regions (Dulamsuren et al., 2013). In North Asia, tree growth is intertwined with permafrost, snowpack, insect outbreaks, wildfires, seed dispersal and climate (e.g., Klinge et al., 2018). It is challenging to isolate the affects of individual factors, particularly since they can interact on one another in unanticipated ways because the underlying mechanisms are not well understood (Berner et al., 2013; Brazhnik and Shugart, 2015). The accuracy of treeline-shift projections is limited because projections are based on vegetation models which do not consider all the factors (Tishkov et al., 2020). The regional vegetation model structure and parameterisation can affect model performance, and the corresponding projections can differ significantly (Shuman et al., 2015)."

In East Asia, Cunninghamia lanceolate, a fast-growing and widely distributed coniferous timber species in China, is projected to increase distribution, to decrease the establishment probability and to reduce total NPP by the 2050s (Liu et al., 2014c). In the monsoon regions of Asia, by the end of the 21st century, NPP is projected to increase by 9–45% (Ito et al., 2016). Under climate change on the Korean Peninsula (KP), the potential habitat for Abies nephrolepis is the northern part of KP, and A. koreana will disappear from Jeju Island and shrink significantly in the KP (Yun et al., 2018), while evergreen forests will expand to the northern part of KP (Koo et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2018). It is expected that under projected warming, fig species in China will expand to higher latitudes and altitudes (Chen et al., 2018c). In Japan, under the A1B scenario, 89% of the area currently covered by the Fagus crenata-dominant forest type will be replaced by Quercus spp.-dominant forest types (Matsui et al., 2018). Current trends of climate change will reduce distribution of tall (2–2.5 m high) herb communities in Japan, and will increase suitably for them in the Russian Far East (Korznikov et al., 2019). A range expansion of Lobaria pindarensis, an endemic epiphytic lichen in the HKH region, is projected to move to the northeast and to higher altitudes in response to climate change, although the species’ low dispersal abilities and the local availability of trees as a substratum will considerably limit latitudinal and altitudinal shifts (Devkota et al., 2019)."

All four RCP scenarios showed north-ward expansion of vulnerable regions to pine wilt disease in China, Republic of Korea, the Russian Far East and Japan under climate conditions in 2070 (Hirata et al., 2017), and during 2026–2050 in Japan (Matsuhashi et al., 2020). It is noteworthy that disease expansion depends not only on climatic factors but also on the dispersal capacity of insect vectors, the transportation of infected logs to non-infected regions and the susceptibility of host trees (e.g., Gruffudd et al., 2016). The suitable habitat area of the snow leopard Panthera uncia is projected to increase by 20% under the IPCC Scenario A1B by 2080: for the seven northernmost snow leopard range states (Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia) the suitable habitat area will increase, while habitat loss is expected on the southern slope of the Himalaya and the southeast Tibetan Plateau (Farrington and Li, 2016). Climate change projected under four RCP scenarios will not affect the distribution patterns of Turkestan Rock Agama Paralaudakia lehmanni (Nikolsky 1896; Sancholi, 2018).

wg2_ch10_10.4.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Under regional projections for North Asia, warmer climate will increase forest fire severity by the late 21st century (medium confidence). For the southern taiga in Tuva Republic, Central Siberia, in a warmer climate, both the annual area burned and fire intensity will increase by 2100. For the central taiga in the Irkutsk region, the annual area burned as well as crown fire-to-ground fire ratiowill increase by the late 21st century compared with the historical (1960–1990) estimate. This moves forest composition towards greater contribution of hardwoods (e.g., Betula spp., Populus spp.) (Brazhnik et al., 2017). This shifting was also proved by observations in northern Mongolia, where boreal forest fires likely  promote the relative dominance of B. platyphylla and threaten the existence of the evergreen conifers, Picea obovata and Pinus sibirica (Otoda et al., 2013). For Tuva Republic, warming ambient temperatures increase the potential evapotranspiration demands on vegetation, but if no concurrent increase in precipitation occurs, vegetation becomes stressed and either dies from temperature-based drought stress or more easily succumbs to insects, fire, pathogens or wind throw (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Although Torzhkov et al. (2019) also projected fire risk (FR) increase in Tuva Republic, they expect FR decrease in the Irkutsk region and Yakutia under RCP8.5, and FR decrease in major parts of Central and East Siberia under RCP4.5 for 2090–2099. This discrepancy is due to differences in models, climate projections, fire severity metrics and other assumptions.

wg2_ch10_10.4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Both natural and managed ecosystems, ecosystem services and livelihoods in Asia will potentially be substantially impacted by changing climate (Wu et al., 2018d). There will be increased risk for biodiversity, particularly many endemic and threatened species of fauna and flora already under environmental pressure from land-use change and other regional and global processes (Zomer et al., 2014; Rashid et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2019). Biomes shift not only serves as a signal of climate change but also provides important information for resources management and ecotone ecosystem conservation. A widespread upwards encroachment of subalpine forests would displace regionally unique alpine tundra habitats and possibly cause the loss of alpine species (Schickhoff et al., 2015). In North Asia, emissions from fires reduce forests’ ability to regulate climate. A warmer and longer growing season will increase vulnerability to fires, although fires can be attributed both to climate warming and to other human and natural influences. Recent field-based observations revealed that the forests in South Siberia are losing their ability to regenerate after fire and other landscape disturbances under a warming climate (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Data support the hypothesis of a climate-driven increase in fire frequency in boreal forests with the possible turning of boreal forests from a carbon sink to a carbon source (Ponomarev et al., 2016; Schaphoff et al., 2016; Brazhnik et al., 2017; Ponomarev et al., 2018); however, warming resulting from forest fire is partly offset by cooling in response to increased surface albedo of burned areas in a snow-on period (Chen and Loboda, 2018; Chen et al., 2018a; Jia et al., 2019; Lasslop et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Modelling of the interactions between climate-induced vegetation shifts, wildfire and human activities can provide keys to how people in Asia may be able to adapt to climate change (Kicklighter et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2020). Conservation and sustainable development would benefit from being tailored and modified considering the changing climatic conditions and shifting biomes, mountain belts and species ranges (Pörtner et al., 2021). Expanding the nature reserves would help species conservation; to facilitate species movements across climatic gradients, an increase in landscape connectivity can be elaborated by setting up habitat corridors between nature reserves and along elevational and other climatic gradients (Brito-Morales et al., 2018; D’Aloia et al., 2019; United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, 2019). Assisted migration of species should be considered for isolated habitats as mountain summits or where movements are constrained by poor dispersal ability. Introducing seeds of the species to new regions will help to protect them from the extinction risk caused by climate change (Mazangi et al., 2016). In Asian boreal forests, a strategy and integrated programmes should be developed for adaptation of the forests to global climate change, including sustainable forest management, firefighting infrastructure and forest fuel management, afforestation, as well as institutional, social and other measures in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 ‘Life on Land’ (Isaev and Korovin, 2013; Kattsov and Semenov, 2014; Bae et al., 2020). Improvements in forest habitat quality can reduce the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Choi et al., 2021). Adaptation options for freshwater ecosystems in Asia include increasing connectivity in river networks, expanding protected areas, restoring hydrological processes of wetlands and rivers, creating shade to lower temperatures for vulnerable species, assisted translocation and migration of species (Hassan et al., 2020; Chapter 2). Reduction of non-climate anthropogenic impacts can enhance the adaptive capacity of ecosystems (Tchebakova et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch10_box-10.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The West Asia region, especially the Tigris–Euphrates alluvial plain, has been recognised as one of the most important dust-source areas in the world (Cao et al., 2015). The inhabitants of each of these settlements have experienced a decline in dust storms in recent decades, since the late 1980s at Nouakchott, since 2004 at Zabol and since the late 1970s at Minqin. Iran is mostly arid or semiarid, with deserts making up at least 25 million hectares of the country (NASA, 2018). Iran is experiencing unprecedented climate-related problems such as drying of lakes and rivers, dust storms, record-breaking temperatures, droughts and floods (Vaghefi et al., 2019). There are three key factors responsible for the generation of sand and dust storms: strong wind, lack of vegetation and absence of rainfall (EcoMENA, 2020). It seems that all of this is closely related to the heating surface and the occurrence of local dry instabilities (Ghasem et al., 2012). According to EcoMENA (2020), sand and dust storms cause significant negative impacts on society, the economy and the environment at the local, regional and global levels. The seasonality of the numbers of dusty days (NDD) in Iran shows the highest frequency in summer followed by spring and autumn (Modarres and Sadeghi, 2018). In the past decade, West Asia has witnessed more frequent and intensified dust storms affecting Iran and other Persian Gulf countries (Nabavi et al., 2016). In terms of long-term frequency of dust events, observational analyses show an overall rising trend of the frequency of Iran’s dust events in recent years (Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2016). Results show that there has been a direct relationship between dust event, drought and years of intensive drought (Dastorani and Jafari, 2019). Compared with the period 1980–2004, in the period 2025–2049, Iran is likely  to experience more extended periods of extreme maximum temperatures in the southern part of the country, more extended periods of dry (for ≥120 d: precipitation <2 mm, Tmax≥30°C) as well as wet (for ≤3 d: total precipitation ≥110 mm) conditions and a higher frequency of floods (Vaghefi et al., 2019). The slope of precipitation in West Asia shows that during the period 2016–2045 in January, February, July and August, precipitation would increase and decrease in other months of the year (Ahmadi et al., 2018). Temperatures in Central Asia have risen significantly within recent decades, whereas mean precipitation remains almost unchanged (Haag et al., 2019); however, climatic trends can vary greatly between different sub-regions, across altitudinal levels and within seasons (Haag et al., 2019)."

Scientists believe that increasing GHGs (the Earth’s temperature controllers) is the cause of this global warming, and by using satellite measurements, these scientists have forecasted on average 1–2 mm for SLR (Jafari et al., 2016). The level of thermal stress (based on a degree heating month index, DHMI) at these locations during the 2015–2016 El Niño was unprecedented and stronger than previous ones (Lough et al., 2018). In the Persian Gulf, the reef-bottom temperatures in 2017 were among the hottest on record, with mean daily maxima averaging 35.9 ± 0.10°C across sites, with hourly temperatures reaching as high as 37.7°C (Riegl et al., 2018). About 94.3% of corals were bleached, and about 66% perished, in 2017 (Burt et al., 2019). In 2018 coral cover averaged just 7.5% across the southern basin of the Persian Gulf. This mass mortality did not cause dramatic shifts in community composition as earlier bleaching events had removed the most sensitive taxa. An exception was the already rare Acropora spp. which were locally extirpated in summer 2017 (Burt et al., 2019).

Rare thermally tolerant algae and host species-specific algae may play important roles in coral bleaching (van der Zande et al., 2020). Along the Indian coast, in the coral reefs of Palk Bay (Bay of Bengal), varied bleaching and recovery patterns among coral genera was observed during the 2016 bleaching episode (Thinesh et al., 2019).

In the Philippines, during the 2010 bleaching event, the size structure of the mushroom coral was found to be affected (Feliciano et al., 2018). In Indonesia, it was found that branching coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals (Hennige et al., 2010).

Coral culture and transplantation within the Gulf are feasible for helping maintain coral species populations and preserving genomes and adaptive capacities of Gulf corals that are endangered by future thermal-stress events (Coles and Riegl, 2013). Greater focus on understanding the flexibility and adaptability of people associated with coral reefs, especially in a time of rapid global change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019), and a well-designed research programme for developing a more targeted policy agenda (Lam et al., 2019), is also recommended.

They reduce flooding to 613,500 people yr –1, 23% of whom live below the poverty line and avert damages up to 1 billion USD yr –1 in residential and industrial property. Mangroves have also become a very popular source of livelihood in Asia through tourism (Dehghani et al., 2010; Kuenzer and Tuan, 2013; Spalding and Parret, 2019; Dasgupta et al., 2020) and they also support fisheries (Hutchison et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.3_p16,10.4.3.1 Key Drivers to Vulnerability ,"Mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows (collectively called coastal blue carbon ecosystems) have sequestered carbon dioxide from the atmosphere continuously over thousands of years, building stocks of carbon in biomass and organic rich soils. Carbon dynamics in mangrove-converted aquaculture in Indonesia indicate that the mean ecosystem carbon stocks in shrimp ponds are less than half of the relatively intact mangroves (Arifanti et al., 2019). Conversion of mangroves into shrimp ponds in the Mahakam Delta have resulted in a carbon loss equivalent to 226 years of soil carbon accumulation in natural mangroves. In the Philippines, abandoned fishpond reversion to former mangrove has been found to be favourable for enhancing climate change mitigation and adaptation (Duncan et al., 2016). Integrated mangrove-shrimp farming, with deforested areas not exceeding 50% of the total farm area, has been suggested to support both carbon sequestration as well as livelihood (Ahmed et al., 2018)."

In Asia, the total extent of these three ecosystems is 33,224 km 2, forming 27.6% of the global total with the highest spread of mangrove at 32,767 km 2, which forms 28.6% of the global mangrove coverage. The area of seagrass meadows spread in Asia has been estimated as 236 km 2 and salt marsh 220 km 2,which forms 10.8 and 6.03% of the respective ecosystems globally (Himes-Cornell et al., 2018). Found at the land–sea interface, seagrasses provide varied services apart from acting as ecosystem engineers providing shelter and habitat for several marine fauna which are fished in several Asian countries (Jeyabaskaran et al., 2018; Nordlund et al., 2018; Unsworth et al., 2019b) thereby providing livelihood to millions across the continent (UNEP, 2020)."

In Vietnam, the loss of seagrass has been estimated as above 50% and in some regions complete loss has been observed (Van Luong et al., 2012). The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are fast deteriorating, and the need for increased local autonomy for the management of marine resources and restoration has been highlighted (Unsworth et al., 2018). Development of science-based policies for conservation, including participatory methods (Fortes, 2018; Ramesh et al., 2019; Unsworth et al., 2019a) and large-scale planting (van Katwijk et al., 2016), has been recommended to preserve the ecosystem services of these habitats."

The oyster Crassostrea gigas becomes more vulnerable to disease when exposed to acidification conditions and pathogen challenge indicating incapability for supporting long-term viability of the population (Cao et al., 2018). More tolerance and benefits to rising pCO2 was observed in clam species like Paphia undulate which has been attributed to adaptation to its acidified sediment habitat (Guo et al., 2016). Warming boosted the energy budget of marine calcifiers like the gastropod Austrocochlea concamerata, by faster shell growth and greater shell strength, making them more mechanically resilient while acidification negatively affected shell building thereby impacting the physiological adaptability (Leung et al., 2020). It is expected that there will be transgenerational acclimation to changes in ocean acidification in marine invertebrates (Lee et al., 2020b)."

Outbreak of intense blooms of species like Ulva rigida (Gao et al., 2017) and Ulva prolifera (Zhang et al., 2019 f) have increased due to varied factors including climate change. These blooms have created huge economic losses in the Yellow Sea affecting local mariculture, tourism and the functioning of the coastal and marine ecosystems (Zhang et al., 2019 f). Increased temperature was found to enhance the dark respiration and light compensation point of Ulva conglobate, which thrives in the mid-intertidal to upper subtidal zones, while the altered pH showed a limited effect (Li et al., 2020). Elevated temperature significantly enhanced growth, photosynthetic performances and carbon-use efficiency of Sargassum horneri in both elevated and ambient CO2 levels suggesting that the present greenhouse effect would benefit the golden tide blooming macroalgae Sargassum horneri, which might enhance both the frequency and scale of golden tide (Wu et al., 2019b)."

Analysis of data on the occurrence of varied natural hazards from 1900 to 2019 has shown that tropical cyclones, riverine floods and droughts have increased significantly, and the impacts of these events on coastal communities are also severe and destructive.

Global analyses of such events have indicated that they may have an impact on the fishery directly by creating unfavourable ecological conditions and destruction of critical habitats indirectly by affecting the eggs and larvae as well as subsequent fishery recruitment (McKinnon et al., 2003; Bailey and Secor, 2016). In the South China Sea in July 2000, during a 3-day cyclone period, an estimated thirtyfold increase in surface chlorophyll-a concentration was observed (Lin et al., 2003). The estimated carbon fixation resulting from this event alone is 0.8 Mt, or 2–4% of the SCS’s annual new production (Lin et al., 2003).

Modelling results indicate that even under RCP scenarios, the functional traits of coral reefs can be affected (van der Zande et al., 2020) and coral communities will mainly consist of small numbers of temperature-tolerant and fast-growing species (Kubicek et al., 2019). Increases in temperature (+3°C) and pCO2 (+400 matm) projected for this century can reduce the sperm availability for fertilisation, which along with adult population decline either due to climate change or anthropogenic impacts (Hughes et al., 2017) can affect coral reproductive success thereby reducing the recovery of populations and their adaptation potential (Albright and Mason, 2013; Hughes et al., 2018; Jamodiong et al., 2018). In the southern Persian Gulf, increased disturbance frequency and severity has caused progressive reduction in coral size, cover and population fecundity (Riegl et al., 2018), and this can lead to functional extinction. Connectivity required to avoid extinctions has increased exponentially with disturbance frequency and correlation of disturbances across the metapopulation. In the Philippines experiments have also proved that scleractinian corals, such as A. tenuis, A. millepora and F. colemani, which spawn their gametes directly into the water column, may experience limitations from sperm dilution and delays in initial sperm–egg encounters that can impact successful fertilisation (de la Cruz and Harrison, 2020)."

Analysis of data on the occurrence of varied natural hazards from 1900 to 2019 has shown that tropical cyclones, riverine floods and droughts have increased significantly, and the impacts of these events on coastal communities are also severe and destructive. The UN’s average score for SDG Goal 14 (Life Under Water) for Asia was estimated as 46 among the scores of 40 nations, and the Ocean Health Biodiversity index was comparatively high (average 87.9); however, the indices show that more region-specific action plans are required to achieve the UN 2030 goal for Life Under Water."

During tropical cyclones ecological variations, like lowering of SST, an increase in chlorophyll-a and a decrease in oxygen (Chacko, 2019; Girishkumar et al., 2019) have been observed. Global analyses of such events have indicated that they may have an impact on the fishery directly by creating unfavourable ecological conditions and destruction of critical habitats indirectly by affecting the eggs and larvae as well as subsequent fishery recruitment (McKinnon et al., 2003; Bailey and Secor, 2016). In the South China Sea in July 2000, during a 3-day cyclone period, an estimated thirtyfold increase in surface chlorophyll-a concentration was observed (Lin et al., 2003). The estimated carbon fixation resulting from this event alone is 0.8 Mt, or 2–4% of the SCS’s annual new production (Lin et al., 2003). Since an average of 14 cyclones pass over this region annually, the contribution of cyclones to the annual new production has been estimated to be as high as 20–30% (Lin et al., 2003)."

Assuming the pollution levels remain at the 2014 levels, different scenarios including RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 were worked out for the Bohai Sea, and the results indicated amplification of the impacts on the ecosystem. Pollutants like petroleum hydrocarbons, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus were the major pollution stressors (Lu et al., 2018).

Modelling results indicate that even under RCP scenarios, the functional traits of coral reefs can be affected (van der Zande et al., 2020) and coral communities will mainly consist of small numbers of temperature-tolerant and fast-growing species (Kubicek et al., 2019). Increases in temperature (+3°C) and pCO2 (+400 matm) projected for this century can reduce the sperm availability for fertilisation, which along with adult population decline either due to climate change or anthropogenic impacts (Hughes et al., 2017) can affect coral reproductive success thereby reducing the recovery of populations and their adaptation potential (Albright and Mason, 2013; Hughes et al., 2018; Jamodiong et al., 2018). In the southern Persian Gulf, increased disturbance frequency and severity has caused progressive reduction in coral size, cover and population fecundity (Riegl et al., 2018), and this can lead to functional extinction. Connectivity required to avoid extinctions has increased exponentially with disturbance frequency and correlation of disturbances across the metapopulation. In the Philippines experiments have also proved that scleractinian corals, such as A. tenuis, A. millepora and F. colemani, which spawn their gametes directly into the water column, may experience limitations from sperm dilution and delays in initial sperm–egg encounters that can impact successful fertilisation (de la Cruz and Harrison, 2020)."

Better mangrove management through mapping is suggested (Castillo et al., 2018; Gandhi and Jones, 2019). Statistical tools developed for modelling biomass and timber volume (Phan et al., 2019), and allometric models to estimate above-ground biomass and carbon stocks (Vinh et al., 2019), will be useful in estimating stocks in mangroves. Future mangrove loss may be offset by increasing national and international conservation initiatives that incorporate mangroves, such as the SDGs, Blue Carbon, and Payments for Ecosystem Services (Friess et al., 2019). Since seagrass meadows and marine macroalgae are important habitats capable of combating impacts of climate change, the need for a global networking system with participation of stakeholders has been suggested (Duffy et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.4_p1,10.4.4.1 Key Drivers ,"In Asia, freshwater resources, an important component of ecosystem services, are widely used for agriculture, domestic, irrigation, navigation, energy and industry. Freshwater availability is changing at the global scale because of unsustainable use of surface water and groundwater, pollution and other environmental changes. These changes in space and time, directly or indirectly, affect water-use sectors and services (Wheater and Gober, 2015; Rodell et al., 2018). About 82% of the global population served by freshwater provisions from upstream areas are exposed to high threat (Green et al., 2015). Given that some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in Asia, and the geographies of development are highly uneven, both CIDs and non-climate drivers, such as socioeconomic changes, have contributed to water stress conditions in both water supply and demand in diverse sub-regions of Asia. In the case of Asia, therefore, the entanglement between the non-climate drivers and CIDs makes it difficult to attribute environmental changes—both present and projected—neatly and exclusively to CIDs."

(2020) have ranked all mountain-dependent water towers according to their water-supplying role and the downstream dependence of ecosystems, societies and economies. The resulting Global Water Tower index indicates that the upper Indus basin is both the most important and the most vulnerable water tower unit (WTU) in the world. A WTU is defined as ‘the intersection between major river basins and a topographic mountain classification based on elevation and surface roughness’. Whereas all important transboundary WTUs in Asia remain highly vulnerable, it is the Indus WTU (inhabited by approximately 235 million people in the basin in 2016 (which is projected to increase by 50% by the middle of 21st century) where the average annual temperature is projected to increase by 1.9°C between 2000 and 2050, with wide-ranging consequences and trans-sectoral spillovers. The Indus WTU faces a deep risk produced by a combination of factors including water stress, ineffective governance, hydropolitical tensions, population growth and density, urbanisation and social transformations, with a significant bearing on SDG 6 on water, SDG 2 on food and SDG 7 on energy."
wg2_ch10_10.4.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Across Asia and its various sub-regions, the key drivers behind an increasingly inadequate supply of freshwater resources, affecting the livelihood security of millions, are varied, complex and intersect with multiple social, cultural, economic and environmental stressors (Luo et al., 2017; Tucker et al., 2015; Kongsager et al., 2016). Water stress has been defined as the situation ‘when the demand for water exceeds its supply, during a certain period of time, or when poor quality restricts its use’(Felberg et al., 1999; see also Figure 4.32 in Lee et al., 2021a)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Freshwater resources in Asia, which include both surface water and groundwater, are considerably strained, and changing climate is likely  to act as a major stress multiplier (Dasgupta et al., 2015 ; Fant et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018c; Mack, 2018). In Southern and Eastern Asia (SEA) nearly 200 million people are at risk of serious water-stressed conditions. Effective mitigation might reduce the additional population under threat by 30% (60 million people), but still there is a 50% chance that 100 million people across SEA might face a 50% increase in water stress and a 10% chance that water stress will almost double in the absence of wide-ranging, multi-scalar adaptive measures (Gao et al., 2018c). With Millennium Development Goal 7c, which aimed to halve the population that had no sustainable access to water and basic sanitation before 2015, not having been fully realised, and Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation not having been effectively operationalised, the water stress is likely  to increase by the end of 2030 (Weststrate et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"In Asia and elsewhere the interplay between the challenge of sustainability and climate change poses major policy challenges (von Stechow et al., 2016). The pursuit of SDG 6—protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems, universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all, improvement in water quality by reducing pollution, elimination of dumping and significant reduction in release of hazardous chemicals and materials, and treatment of waste water through recycling and safe reuse globally—could be directly or indirectly challenged and undermined by climate change (Parkinson et al., 2019). Dissolved organic materials from sewage can enhance CO2 emissions, especially in rapidly urbanising river systems which receive untreated waste water and/or sewage across developing countries (Kim et al., 2019b). Conversely, policy interventions aimed at significant augmentation in water-use efficiency across all sectors, ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and a significant reduction in the number of victims of water scarcity, especially the poor and marginalised, could mitigate vulnerabilities caused by climate change. More interdisciplinary research is needed on highly precarious future pathways and the intersection between CIDs and non-climate drivers in order to anticipate and mitigate diverging and uncertain outcomes."

Water stress is likely  to be more pronounced in Pakistan, and northern parts of India and China. By mid-21st Century, the international transboundary river basins of Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges could face severe water scarcity challenges due to climatic variability and changes acting as stress multipliers (high confidence). Within a country as well, the water scarcity could be exacerbated, such as in India and China, due to various drivers like population increase and climate change.

The HKH region stores about half of the ice mass in HMA, provisioning freshwater to almost 869 million people in the Indus, Tarim, Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins. While the warming climate increases the melt-water runoff enhancing water supply, it is indeed at the cost of glacier-mass reduction that would eventually reduce melt water and impact the people’s livelihood downstream in the future (Nie et al., 2021). The melt runoff from the region plays an important role in downstream agriculture such as in the case of Indus where two-thirds of total irrigation withdrawal is from melt runoff in the pre-monsoon season (Biemans et al., 2019).

A study on water availability in mainland South Asia has pointed in the direction of decreasing precipitation trends in recent years, which have also contributed to the increasing incidence and severity of droughts (Liu et al., 2018b). There are reports of increase in occurrence and severity of different forms of droughts in the Koshi River basin (Central Himalaya) (Wu et al., 2019a; Hamal et al., 2020; Dahal et al., 2021; Nepal et al., 2021).

The changes in snowmelt water can explain 19% of the variations in rivers of arid regions like Xinjiang, China (Bai et al., 2018) (medium confidence), and the 10.6% of the runoff of the upper Brahmaputra River was contributed by snow during 2003–2014 (Chen et al., 2017c) (medium confidence). A recent study (Chen et al., 2018 f) has shown that with the average temperature after 1998 being 1.0°C higher than that during 1960–1998 in the Tienshan Mountains, the process of glacier shrinkage and decreases in snow cover are causing earlier peak runoff and aggravated extreme hydrological events, affecting regional water availability and adding to the future water crisis in Central Asia. The magnitude and frequency of flooding have increased across the Himalayan region, such as in the Tarim basin in China (Zhang et al., 2016c) and the higher Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra, in the past six decades (Elalem and Pal, 2015). The latter also reported the highest number of flood disasters and greater spatial coverage in recent decades as compared with previous decades. In the Middle Yellow River basin, which has become much warmer and drier, climate variability accounts for 75.8% of streamflow decrease during 1980–2000, whereas during 2001–2016, change in land use and cover was the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5% of the decline (Bao et al., 2019).

In the Lancang-Mekong River basin, climate variability would have contributed 45% more flood occurrences in the middle of the basin, while reservoir operation reduced it by 36% during 2008–2016 as compared with 1985–2007 (Yun et al., 2020)."

While rising temperatures can reduce streamflow via evapotranspiration, it can enhance groundwater discharge to rivers due to permafrost thawing. In permafrost-developed basins, the thawing permafrost will continue to result in increased streamflow. However, with further permafrost degradation in the future, the positive effect of permafrost thaw on streamflow would probably be offset by the negative effect of the increase in basin evapotranspiration. This could result in a situation where runoff reaches threshold level and then declines. This is clearly marked in the Ob River basin, which is characterised by the highest precipitation, whereas in the case of the Yenisei and Lena rivers, further research is needed."

Nepal has experienced 24 GLOF events which have caused considerable loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure (Icimod, 2011).

In the eastern tributary of the Ganges system, the alluvial fan of the Koshi River basin has shifted by more than 113 km to the west in the past two centuries (Chakraborty et al., 2010), which may be due to heavy sediment load from the Himalayan rivers in which about 50 million tons of sediment is deposited annually in the alluvial plains (Sinha et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2010)."

A recent study (Liu et al., 2019a) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 500-m spatial resolution global water product data, and applying the least squares method to analyse changes in the area of 14 lakes in Central Asia from 2001 to 2016, has shown that the area-shrinkage changes for all plains lakes in the study region could be attributed to climate change and human activities."

A regional quantitative assessment (Lutz et al., 2019) of the impacts of 1.5°C versus 2°C global warming for a major global climate-change hotspot–the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins (IGB) in South Asia–shows adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural production, hydropower production and human health. A global temperature increase of 1.5°C with respect to pre-industrial levels would imply a ≈ 2.1°C temperature increase for IGB, whereas under a 2.0°C global temperature increase scenario, these river basins would warm by ≈ 2.7°C. Future warming is expected to further increase rain-on-snow events that can cause snowmelt flood during winter (Ohba and Kawase, 2020), affecting hydropower and resulting in river flooding, avalanches and landslides."

Local- and regional-scale projections suggest that peak water will generally be reached around the middle of the century, followed by steadily declining glacier runoff thereafter (Hock et al., 2019). A global-scale projection suggests that a decline in glacier runoff by 2100 (RCP8.5) may reduce basin runoff by about 10% for at least 1 month of the melt season (Huss and Hock, 2018). Significantly, research on climate change and its impact across Asia remains inconclusive and requires an assessment at the sub-regional scale (IPCC, 2014a; Wester et al., 2019)."

Likewise, Khanal et al. (2021) suggest contrasting responses to climate change for HMA rivers in which, on the seasonal scale, the earlier onset of melting causes a shift in magnitude and peak of water availability, whereas on the annual scale, total water availability increases for the headwaters. The future flow would increase in Nepal’s Central Himalaya region (Nepal, 2016; Ragettli et al., 2016; Bajracharya et al., 2018). These changes in water availability in space and time will have serious consequences in downstream water availability for various sectoral uses and ecosystem functioning in Asia (Nepal et al., 2014; Green et al., 2015; Arfanuzzaman, 2018; Wijngaard et al., 2018; Rasul and Molden, 2019); however, future water availability is largely uncertain due to significant variation in climate-change projections among different global climate models (Nepal and Shrestha, 2015; Lutz et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019a)."

The projected changes in annual precipitation indicate a clear trend to increase in the Zhabay and decrease in the Murghab catchments, and for other catchments, they were smaller. Both the projected trends for river discharge and precipitation show an increase in the northern and decrease in the southern parts of the study region, whereas seasonal changes include a shift in the peak of river discharge up to one month, a shortening of the snow accumulation period and a reduction in discharge during the summer months."

The future hydrological extremes of the upper Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins suggest an increase in the magnitude of extremes towards the end of the 21st century by applying RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, mainly due to an increase in precipitation extremes (Wijngaard et al., 2017). In the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna, including the downstream component, the runoff is projected to increase by 16, 33 and 40%, respectively, under the climate-change scenarios by the end of the century during which the changes in runoff are larger in the wet seasons than the dry seasons (Masood et al., 2015). In the Mekong River basin also, extremely high-flow events are likely  to increase in both magnitude and frequency, which can exacerbate flood risk in the basin (Hoang et al., 2016); however, uncertainty is high regarding future hydrological response due to large variation in precipitation projections, modelling approaches and bias-correction methods (Nepal and Shrestha, 2015; Lutz et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019a)."

In the case of the Yellow River basin in China, underlining the interface between future water scarcity and hydroclimatic and anthropogenic drivers, a recent study expects moderate-to-severe water scarcity over six Yellow River sub-catchments under the RCP4.5 scenario, and anticipates that human influences on water scarcity will be worse than that of climate change, with water availability in the downstream being impacted by concurrent changes in land use and high temperature (Omer et al., 2020). Nearly 8% of internationally shared or transboundary aquifers (TBAs), ensuring livelihood security for millions of people through sustaining drinking water supply and food production, are currently overstressed due to human overexploitation (Wada and Heinrich, 2013).

It is noteworthy that India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and China together account for more than 50% of the world’s groundwater withdrawals (Scott et al., 2019). A study conducted in the Shahpur and Maner districts of Bihar, India, in which drinking water sourced from the groundwater of 388 households was tested, showed that 70–90% of the sampled household’s drinking water contained either arsenic or iron, or both (Thakur and Gupta, 2019). Given the nexus between CIDs and non-climate drivers, an effective adaptation to the impacts of climate change would also demand sustainable development and management of shared aquifer resources, which in turn require reliable TBA inventories and improved knowledge production and knowledge sharing on the shared groundwater systems (Lee et al., 2018a)."

Further validated by recent research in terms of their usefulness, these adaptation options include building and improving capital-intensive physical water infrastructure such as irrigation channels, flood-control dams and water storage (Nüsser and Schmidt, 2017). Drawing upon customary institutions and combining Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific knowledge, innovative structures, including artificial glaciers, ice stupas and snow barrier bands, have been built by local communities in Ladakh, Zanskar and Himachal Pradesh in India (Hock et al., 2019; Nüsser et al., 2019). Communities in Solukhumbu, Nepal, in response to depleting water flow in snow-fed rivers, have chosen adaptation through changing practices by collecting water from distant sources for domestic consumption (McDowell et al., 2013). Taking the IPCC concept of climate risk as a basis for adaptation planning, a pilot study of flood risk in Himachal Pradesh, India (Allen et al., 2018), integrating assessment of hazard, vulnerability and exposure in the complementary domains of CCA and DRR, has identified stakeholder consultation, knowledge exchange and institutional capacity building as key steps in adaptation planning. Aquifer storage and recovery has been proposed as an ‘alternative climate-proof freshwater source’ for deltaic regions in Asia, particularly those with a history of saline groundwater aquifers (Hoque et al., 2016).

A recent study (Chen et al., 2018 f) has shown that with the average temperature after 1998 being 1.0°C higher than that during 1960–1998 in the Tienshan Mountains, the process of glacier shrinkage and decreases in snow cover are causing earlier peak runoff and aggravated extreme hydrological events, affecting regional water availability and adding to the future water crisis in Central Asia.

The latter also reported the highest number of flood disasters and greater spatial coverage in recent decades as compared with previous decades. In the Middle Yellow River basin, which has become much warmer and drier, climate variability accounts for 75.8% of streamflow decrease during 1980–2000, whereas during 2001–2016, change in land use and cover was the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5% of the decline (Bao et al., 2019).

While rising temperatures can reduce streamflow via evapotranspiration, it can enhance groundwater discharge to rivers due to permafrost thawing. In permafrost-developed basins, the thawing permafrost will continue to result in increased streamflow. However, with further permafrost degradation in the future, the positive effect of permafrost thaw on streamflow would probably be offset by the negative effect of the increase in basin evapotranspiration. This could result in a situation where runoff reaches threshold level and then declines. This is clearly marked in the Ob River basin, which is characterised by the highest precipitation, whereas in the case of the Yenisei and Lena rivers, further research is needed."

Himalayan rivers are frequently hit by catastrophic floods caused by the failure of glacial lakes (Cook et al., 2018; Ahluwalia et al., 2016). In Kedarnath, India (western Himalaya), a flash flood was triggered by glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) released from the Chorabari glacial lake in June 2013 which caused extensive flooding, erosion of riverbanks and damage to downstream villages and towns, as well as the loss of several thousand lives (Rafiq et al., 2019; Das et al., 2015). Nepal has experienced 24 GLOF events which have caused considerable loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure (Icimod, 2011). There is high confidence that current glacier shrinkages have caused more glacial lakes to form in most mountainous regions, including HMA, but there is limited evidence that the frequency of GLOF has changed (Hock et al., 2019). Veh et al. (2018) reported no clear trend of increasing GLOF events in the Himalayan region, although the southern Himalaya was identified as a hotspot region compared with the western Himalaya.

Heavy rains and flooding also increase nutrients, heavy metals and pesticides, as well as turbidity and faecal pathogens in water supplies–especially when sewage treatment plants are overwhelmed by runoff (Mora et al., 2018).

A study of vulnerability assessment of urban waters in highly populated cities in India and Sri Lanka, through analysing the concurrence of Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs), enteric viruses, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, metals, faecal contamination and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), also underlines the need for a resilience strategy and action plan (Rafiq et al., 2019)."

Some of the main reasons for drying springs include anthropogenic impacts (deforestation, exploitative land use), infrastructure (road construction), socioeconomic changes (increasing demand and modernisation of facilities) and climatic changes (changes in rainfall regime and higher temperature) (Stott and Huq, 2014; Tiwari and Joshi, 2014; Sharma et al., 2016)."

For instance, the major floods on the Indus in July 2010 altered the river’s course in Pakistan, moving it closer to the Indian district of Kutch (Grainger and Conway, 2014). In the eastern tributary of the Ganges system, the alluvial fan of the Koshi River basin has shifted by more than 113 km to the west in the past two centuries (Chakraborty et al., 2010), which may be due to heavy sediment load from the Himalayan rivers in which about 50 million tons of sediment is deposited annually in the alluvial plains (Sinha et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2010)."

Due to substantial regional variability, the quantum of future changes in lake water storage remains uncertain. A recent study (Liu et al., 2019a) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 500-m spatial resolution global water product data, and applying the least squares method to analyse changes in the area of 14 lakes in Central Asia from 2001 to 2016, has shown that the area-shrinkage changes for all plains lakes in the study region could be attributed to climate change and human activities."

Local- and regional-scale projections suggest that peak water will generally be reached around the middle of the century, followed by steadily declining glacier runoff thereafter (Hock et al., 2019). A global-scale projection suggests that a decline in glacier runoff by 2100 (RCP8.5) may reduce basin runoff by about 10% for at least 1 month of the melt season (Huss and Hock, 2018).

Likewise, Khanal et al.

The future flow would increase in Nepal’s Central Himalaya region (Nepal, 2016; Ragettli et al., 2016; Bajracharya et al., 2018). These changes in water availability in space and time will have serious consequences in downstream water availability for various sectoral uses and ecosystem functioning in Asia (Nepal et al., 2014; Green et al., 2015; Arfanuzzaman, 2018; Wijngaard et al., 2018; Rasul and Molden, 2019); however, future water availability is largely uncertain due to significant variation in climate-change projections among different global climate models (Nepal and Shrestha, 2015; Lutz et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019a)."

In the Mekong River basin also, extremely high-flow events are likely  to increase in both magnitude and frequency, which can exacerbate flood risk in the basin (Hoang et al., 2016); however, uncertainty is high regarding future hydrological response due to large variation in precipitation projections, modelling approaches and bias-correction methods (Nepal and Shrestha, 2015; Lutz et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019a)."

Drawing upon customary institutions and combining Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific knowledge, innovative structures, including artificial glaciers, ice stupas and snow barrier bands, have been built by local communities in Ladakh, Zanskar and Himachal Pradesh in India (Hock et al., 2019; Nüsser et al., 2019). Communities in Solukhumbu, Nepal, in response to depleting water flow in snow-fed rivers, have chosen adaptation through changing practices by collecting water from distant sources for domestic consumption (McDowell et al., 2013). Taking the IPCC concept of climate risk as a basis for adaptation planning, a pilot study of flood risk in Himachal Pradesh, India (Allen et al., 2018), integrating assessment of hazard, vulnerability and exposure in the complementary domains of CCA and DRR, has identified stakeholder consultation, knowledge exchange and institutional capacity building as key steps in adaptation planning. Aquifer storage and recovery has been proposed as an ‘alternative climate-proof freshwater source’ for deltaic regions in Asia, particularly those with a history of saline groundwater aquifers (Hoque et al., 2016).

The spatial variations of glacier and other climate variables have added to uncertainty related to the dynamic of the water cycle. The headwater regions, such as Pamir area, would be significantly affected by the climate parameters, such as the stronger rainfall intensity, more frequent rainfall and higher temperature (Luo et al., 2019). The water resources in the Pamir Plateau will range from −0.48 to 5.6% (Gulakhmadov et al., 2020), and the crop phenological period in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will be about 1–2 weeks earlier. The threat of agricultural water stress is increasing as well. The oasis in downstream areas will face more complex water resource fluctuations, water crisis and desertification. In particular, rain-fed agriculture in northern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and western Turkmenistan is particularly dependent on water resources. Under the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, considering CO2 fertilisation effects and land-use projections, the increase in CO2 atmospheric concentration and accumulated temperature can contribute to a 23% increase in cotton yield in Central Asia (Tian and Zhang, 2019), but extreme climate, such as drought, heatwaves and rainstorms, will have a 10% negative impact on agricultural production and the ecological environment (Zhang and Ren, 2017).

Since the release of IPCC AR5, more studies have reinforced the earlier findings on the spatio-temporal diversity of climate-change impacts on food production in Asia depending on the geographic location, agroecology and crops grown (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Ahmad et al., 2019), recognising that there are winners and losers associated with the changing climate across scales (Dasgupta et al., 2013a; Yong-Jian et al., 2013; Bobojonov and Aw-Hassan, 2014; Hijioka et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014a; Prabnakorn et al., 2018; Trisurat et al., 2018; Matsumoto, 2019). Despite the observed increase in total food production in terms of crops and food yields from 1990 to 2014 in Asia (FAO, 2015), there is high confidence that overall, at the regional level, the projected total negative impacts will far outweigh the expected benefits, with India emerging as the most vulnerable nation in terms of crop production (Figure 10.6). Recent evidence also indicates that climate-related risks to agriculture and food security in Asia will progressively escalate as global warming reaches 1.5°C and higher above pre-industrial levels (IPCC, 2018b) with differentiated impacts across the Asian continent."

In general, major impacts to agricultural production, such as those observed by the farmers in the Philippines and Indonesia, include among others delays in crop harvesting, declining crop yields and quality of produce, increasing incidence of pests and diseases, stunted growth, livestock mortality and low farm income (Stevenson et al., 2013). In South Asia, the series of monsoon floods from 2005 to 2015 contributed to a high level of loss in agricultural production with peaks in 2008 and 2015 (FAO, 2018a). Similarly, in Pakistan, farmers are experiencing a decline in crop yields and increasing incidence of crop diseases as a result of climate extremes, particularly floods, droughts and heatwaves (Fahad and Wang, 2018; Ahmad et al., 2019)."

In a study in the Mun River basin, northeast Thailand, yield losses of rice due to past climate trends covering the period 1984–2013 was determined to be in the range of < 50 kg ha –1 per decade or 3% of actual average yields with a high possibility of more serious yield losses in the future (Prabnakorn et al., 2018). Likewise, in China, an economic loss of 595–858 million USD for the corn and soybean sectors was computed from 2000 to 2009 (Chen et al., 2016b). On the other hand, the intensive wheat–maize system in China seems to have benefited from climate change with the northward expansion of the northern limits of maize and multi-cropping systems brought about by the rising temperatures (Li and Li, 2014)."

The 2004 El Niño caused the Philippines an 18% production loss during the dry season and a 32% production loss during the wet season (Cruz et al., 2017). In the 2015 El Niño event, the Indian oil sardine fishery declined by more than 50% of previous years (Kripa et al., 2018) severely impacting coastal livelihoods and economies (Shyam et al., 2017). The 2015–2016 El Niño also inflicted adverse impacts on agricultural productivity and food security, especially affecting the rural poor in middle- and lower-income countries in Southeast and South Asia (UNDP ESCAP OCHA RIMES APCC, 2017)."

This sector provides employment to an estimated 50.46 million people where fishing and aquaculture are important socioeconomic activities and fish products are a substantial source of animal protein (Bogard et al., 2015; Azad, 2017; FAO, 2018c). The economic contribution could be as high as 44% of the coastal communities’ GDP as in the case of Sri Lanka (Sarathchandra et al., 2018). Five Asian countries (i.e., China, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Japan) are in the top ten of global fish producers, representing a cumulative share of 36% in 2018 (FAO, 2020). As a top producer with 15% global share, China also remains a top exporter of fish and fish products with 14% global market share."
wg2_ch10_10.4.5.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is high agreement  in the literature that Asian fisheries and aquaculture, including the local communities depending on them for livelihoods, are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Asia has been impacted by SLR (Panpeng and Ahmad, 2017), a decrease in precipitation in some parts (Salik et al., 2015) and an increase in temperature (Vivekanandan et al., 2016), all of which have drastic effects on fisheries and aquaculture (FAO, 2018c). Its coastal fishing communities is exposed to disasters, which are predicted to increase (Esham et al., 2018). Fisheries in most of South Asia and Southeast Asia involve small-scale fishers who are more vulnerable to climate-change impacts compared with commercial fishers (Sönke Kreft et al., 2016; Blasiak et al., 2017), although there is a general decreasing trend in the number of small units (Fernandez-Llamazares et al., 2015; ILO, 2015). A regional study of South Asia forecast large decreases in potential catch of two key commercial fish species (hilsa shad and Bombay duck) in the Bay of Bengal (Fernandes et al., 2016), which forms a major fishery and food source for coastal communities. About 69% of the commercially important species of the Indian marine fisheries were found to be impacted by climate change and other anthropogenic factors (Dineshbabu et al., 2020). Likewise, water salinisation brought about by SLR is expected to impact the availability of freshwater fish in southwest coastal Bangladesh with adverse implications to poor communities (Dasgupta et al., 2017a). Analysis of fishery has indicated that there will be a continued decrease in catch impacting the seafood sector in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (Nong, 2019). Climate change is predicted to decrease total productive fisheries potential in South and Southeast Asia, driven by a temperature increase of approximately 2°C by 2050 (Barange et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.5.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Like fisheries, Asian aquaculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Shrimp farmers and fry catchers of Bangladesh are frequently affected by extreme climatic disruptions like cyclones and storm surges that severely damage the entire coastal aquaculture (Islam et al., 2016a; Kais and Islam, 2018). The majority of shrimp farmers also observed that weather has changed abruptly during the past 5 years and that high temperature is most detrimental because it lowers growth rate, increases susceptibility to diseases, including deformation, and affects production (Islam et al., 2016a). Low production in shrimp farming is also attributed to variation and intensity of rainfall perceived by the majority of farmers as part of climate-change impacts (Ahmed and Diana, 2015; Islam et al., 2016a; Henriksson et al., 2019). In Vietnam, small-scale shrimp farmers are likewise vulnerable to climate change, although those who practise an extensive type of farming with low inputs are more vulnerable compared with those who practise a more intensive type with more capital investment (Quach et al., 2015; Quach et al., 2017). Seaweed farming in Asia is very popular, and the significance of seaweed aquaculture beds in capturing carbon is recognised, but most of the farmed seaweeds are susceptible to climate change (Chung et al., 2017a; Duarte et al., 2017)."

Predicting MHWs is considered a prerequisite for increasing the preparedness of farmers (Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018). In Southeast Asian countries more than 30% of aquaculture areas are predicted to become unsuitable for production by 2050–2070 and aquaculture production is predicted to decrease 10–20% by 2050–2070 due to climate change (Froehlich et al., 2018)."

New research findings affirm that climate-change impacts, and will continue to significantly affect, crop production in diverse ways in particular areas all over Asia (Figure 10.6). An increasing number of sub-regional and regional studies using various modelling tools provide significant  evidence on the overall projected impacts of climate change on crop production at the sub-regional and regional scales with clear indications of winners and losers among and within nations (see, for instance, Mendelsohn, 2014; Cai et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016b; Schleussner et al., 2016)."

A large-scale evaluation by Ishigooka et al. (2017) shows that the increased risk in rice production brought about by temperature increase may be avoided by selecting an optimum transplanting date considering both yield and quality. More studies of this nature have to be conducted for other crops in different locations to better understand and adapt to the negative impacts of the changing climate on the quality of crops (Ahmed and Stepp, 2016)."

As global warming compounds beyond 1.5°C, however, the likelihood of adverse impacts on agricultural and food security in many parts of developing Asia increases (Mendelsohn, 2014; IPCC, 2018b). There is a growing trend towards more integrated studies and modelling that combines biophysical and socioeconomic variables (including management practices) in the context of changing climate to reduce uncertainty associated with future impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector (see, for instance, Mason-D’Croz et al., 2016; Smeets Kristkova et al., 2016; Gaydon et al., 2017)."

This scarcity of information persists to the current assessment with very scant information on the projected impacts and adaptation aspects of livestock production (Escarcha et al., 2018a). The use of scenarios and models to determine alternative futures with participatory engagement processes has been recommended for informed policy and decision making with potential application in the livestock sector (Mason-D’Croz et al., 2016). Of the limited assessment available, a study on the smallholders’ risk perceptions of climate change impacts on water-buffalo production systems in Nueva Ecija, the Philippines, identified feed availability and animal health as the production aspects most severely affected by multiple weather extremes (Escarcha et al., 2018b). In the Mongolian Altai Mountains, early snowmelt and an extended growing season have resulted in reduced herder mobility and prolonged pasture use, which has in turn initiated grassland degradation (Lkhagvadorj et al., 2013a). Furthermore, reduced herder mobility has increased the pressure on forests resulting in increased logging for fuel and construction wood and reduced regeneration due to browsing damage by increasing goat populations (Khishigjargal et al., 2013; Dulamsuren et al., 2014)."

In South Asia, a study in Nepal showed that farmers are inclined to change practices in cropland use to reduce climate-change risk (Chalise and Naranpanawa, 2016). In India, climate change is also predicted to lead to boundary changes in areas suitable for growing certain crops (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2016). A study in Bangladesh revealed a shift in crop choices among farmers, implying changes in the future rice-cropping pattern. Specifically, a temperature increase will compel farmers to choose irrigation-based Boro, Aus and other crops in favour of the rain-fed Aman rice crop (Moniruzzaman, 2015)."

In a national study that groups Bangladesh into 16 sub-regions with similar farming areas, simulations of a 62 cm rise in mean sea level project damages to production because of area loss in excess of 31% in sub-region 15 and nearly 40% in sub-region 16 (Ruane et al., 2013). Also in Bangladesh, a study on predicting the design of water requirements for winter paddy rice under climate change conditions shows that agricultural water resource management will help minimise drought risk and implement future agricultural water resource policies (Islam et al., 2018) that may have important implications for crop areas and production."

Agricultural management practice in China may also change to optimise soil organic carbon sequestration (Zhang et al., 2016a). A study on projected irrigation requirements under climate change using a soil-moisture model for 29 upland crops in the Republic of Korea showed that water scarcity is a major limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production (Hong et al., 2016). In terms of drought, despite increasing future precipitation in most scenarios, crop-specific agricultural drought is expected to be a significant risk due to rainfall variability (Lim et al., 2019a). On the other hand, a projected rise in water availability in the Korean Peninsula using multiple regional climate models and evapotranspiration methods indicates that it will likely  increase agricultural productivity for both rice and corn, but would decrease significantly in rain-fed conditions (Lim et al., 2017b). Thus, irrigation and soil-water management will be a major factor in determining future farming systems and crop areas in the country."

In Japan, the projected decline in rice yield in some areas suggests that the current rice-producing regions would be divided into suitable and unsuitable areas as temperatures increases (Ishigooka et al., 2017), with important implications regarding the possible shift in cropping area. Similarly, it has been shown that there will be change in the geographic distribution of the occurrence of poor skin colour of table-grape berries (Sugiura et al., 2019) and suitable areas for cultivation of subtropical citrus (Sugiura et al., 2014) in Japan by the middle of the 21st century."

Increasing evidence from sub-regions and individual countries suggests that climate-related hazards, such as increasing temperature, changing rainfall, SLR, drought, flooding and the more frequent and intense occurrences of El Niño–Southern Oscillation events, all impact agricultural production with significant effects on food security. All these hazards interact with non-climatic factors, such as competing demand for scarce water resources, rural–urban migration, food prices and increasing food demand in the long term, and poor governance, among other things, that may worsen food insecurity in the region (Montesclaros and Teng, 2021)."

Also vulnerable are flood-prone areas like the Vietnam Mekong River Delta where 39% of the total rice area is exposed to sustained flood risks (Wassmann et al., 2019a). Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation levels will persist to be important vulnerability drivers that will shape agricultural productivity particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central Asia as well as in selected areas of the region. With the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events, such as strong typhoons in the Philippines, the agriculture sector in the typhoon-prone areas of Southeast and East Asia, as well as the Indus Delta, will be more vulnerable to crop destruction (Mallari and Ezra, 2016).

Moreover, a recent vulnerability assessment of Korean aquaculture based on predicted changes in seawater temperature and salinity according to RCP8.5 indicated that vulnerability was highest for seaweed, such as laver and sea mustard, while fish, shrimp and abalone are relatively less vulnerable as they are less sensitive to high water temperature and their farming environments are controllable to a large extent (Kim et al., 2019a).

In a recent systematic and comprehensive review of farmers’ adaptation practices in Asia, Shaffril et al.

Site-specific adaptations, such as those in Pakistan, include farmers’ utilisation of several adaptation techniques which include changing crop type and variety, and improving seed quality; fertiliser application and use of pesticides, and planting of shade trees; and water storage and farm diversification (Fahad and Wang, 2018), as well as the implementation of comprehensive climate information services for farming communities (World Meteorological Organization, 2017)."

Fishers’ strong sense of belonging to their place of residence and the sense of responsibility to protect the vulnerable fish stock has been advantageously used for developing cooperatives and starting community-based fisheries management (FAO, 2012; ILO, 2015; Shaffril et al., 2017), and these initiatives have yielded positive results."

Strategies like polyculture, integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) and recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have been suggested to increase aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability and climate change adaptability (Ahmed et al., 2019c; Tran et al., 2020).

In a study in the Mun River basin, northeast Thailand, yield losses of rice due to past climate trends covering the period 1984–2013 was determined to be in the range of < 50 kg ha –1 per decade or 3% of actual average yields with a high possibility of more serious yield losses in the future (Prabnakorn et al., 2018). Likewise, in China, an economic loss of 595–858 million USD for the corn and soybean sectors was computed from 2000 to 2009 (Chen et al., 2016b). On the other hand, the intensive wheat–maize system in China seems to have benefited from climate change with the northward expansion of the northern limits of maize and multi-cropping systems brought about by the rising temperatures (Li and Li, 2014)."

The 2004 El Niño caused the Philippines an 18% production loss during the dry season and a 32% production loss during the wet season (Cruz et al., 2017). In the 2015 El Niño event, the Indian oil sardine fishery declined by more than 50% of previous years (Kripa et al., 2018) severely impacting coastal livelihoods and economies (Shyam et al., 2017). The 2015–2016 El Niño also inflicted adverse impacts on agricultural productivity and food security, especially affecting the rural poor in middle- and lower-income countries in Southeast and South Asia (UNDP ESCAP OCHA RIMES APCC, 2017)."

The economic contribution could be as high as 44% of the coastal communities’ GDP as in the case of Sri Lanka (Sarathchandra et al., 2018). Five Asian countries (i.e., China, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Japan) are in the top ten of global fish producers, representing a cumulative share of 36% in 2018 (FAO, 2020).

wg2_ch10_10.4.5.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is high agreement  in the literature that Asian fisheries and aquaculture, including the local communities depending on them for livelihoods, are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Asia has been impacted by SLR (Panpeng and Ahmad, 2017), a decrease in precipitation in some parts (Salik et al., 2015) and an increase in temperature (Vivekanandan et al., 2016), all of which have drastic effects on fisheries and aquaculture (FAO, 2018c). Its coastal fishing communities is exposed to disasters, which are predicted to increase (Esham et al., 2018). Fisheries in most of South Asia and Southeast Asia involve small-scale fishers who are more vulnerable to climate-change impacts compared with commercial fishers (Sönke Kreft et al., 2016; Blasiak et al., 2017), although there is a general decreasing trend in the number of small units (Fernandez-Llamazares et al., 2015; ILO, 2015). A regional study of South Asia forecast large decreases in potential catch of two key commercial fish species (hilsa shad and Bombay duck) in the Bay of Bengal (Fernandes et al., 2016), which forms a major fishery and food source for coastal communities. About 69% of the commercially important species of the Indian marine fisheries were found to be impacted by climate change and other anthropogenic factors (Dineshbabu et al., 2020). Likewise, water salinisation brought about by SLR is expected to impact the availability of freshwater fish in southwest coastal Bangladesh with adverse implications to poor communities (Dasgupta et al., 2017a). Analysis of fishery has indicated that there will be a continued decrease in catch impacting the seafood sector in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (Nong, 2019). Climate change is predicted to decrease total productive fisheries potential in South and Southeast Asia, driven by a temperature increase of approximately 2°C by 2050 (Barange et al., 2014)."

Shrimp farmers and fry catchers of Bangladesh are frequently affected by extreme climatic disruptions like cyclones and storm surges that severely damage the entire coastal aquaculture (Islam et al., 2016a; Kais and Islam, 2018). The majority of shrimp farmers also observed that weather has changed abruptly during the past 5 years and that high temperature is most detrimental because it lowers growth rate, increases susceptibility to diseases, including deformation, and affects production (Islam et al., 2016a). Low production in shrimp farming is also attributed to variation and intensity of rainfall perceived by the majority of farmers as part of climate-change impacts (Ahmed and Diana, 2015; Islam et al., 2016a; Henriksson et al., 2019). In Vietnam, small-scale shrimp farmers are likewise vulnerable to climate change, although those who practise an extensive type of farming with low inputs are more vulnerable compared with those who practise a more intensive type with more capital investment (Quach et al., 2015; Quach et al., 2017). Seaweed farming in Asia is very popular, and the significance of seaweed aquaculture beds in capturing carbon is recognised, but most of the farmed seaweeds are susceptible to climate change (Chung et al., 2017a; Duarte et al., 2017)."

Predicting MHWs is considered a prerequisite for increasing the preparedness of farmers (Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018). In Southeast Asian countries more than 30% of aquaculture areas are predicted to become unsuitable for production by 2050–2070 and aquaculture production is predicted to decrease 10–20% by 2050–2070 due to climate change (Froehlich et al., 2018)."

New research findings affirm that climate-change impacts, and will continue to significantly affect, crop production in diverse ways in particular areas all over Asia (Figure 10.6). An increasing number of sub-regional and regional studies using various modelling tools provide significant  evidence on the overall projected impacts of climate change on crop production at the sub-regional and regional scales with clear indications of winners and losers among and within nations (see, for instance, Mendelsohn, 2014; Cai et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016b; Schleussner et al., 2016)."

A large-scale evaluation by Ishigooka et al. (2017) shows that the increased risk in rice production brought about by temperature increase may be avoided by selecting an optimum transplanting date considering both yield and quality. More studies of this nature have to be conducted for other crops in different locations to better understand and adapt to the negative impacts of the changing climate on the quality of crops (Ahmed and Stepp, 2016)."

As global warming compounds beyond 1.5°C, however, the likelihood of adverse impacts on agricultural and food security in many parts of developing Asia increases (Mendelsohn, 2014; IPCC, 2018b). There is a growing trend towards more integrated studies and modelling that combines biophysical and socioeconomic variables (including management practices) in the context of changing climate to reduce uncertainty associated with future impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector (see, for instance, Mason-D’Croz et al., 2016; Smeets Kristkova et al., 2016; Gaydon et al., 2017)."

The use of scenarios and models to determine alternative futures with participatory engagement processes has been recommended for informed policy and decision making with potential application in the livestock sector (Mason-D’Croz et al., 2016). Of the limited assessment available, a study on the smallholders’ risk perceptions of climate change impacts on water-buffalo production systems in Nueva Ecija, the Philippines, identified feed availability and animal health as the production aspects most severely affected by multiple weather extremes (Escarcha et al., 2018b). In the Mongolian Altai Mountains, early snowmelt and an extended growing season have resulted in reduced herder mobility and prolonged pasture use, which has in turn initiated grassland degradation (Lkhagvadorj et al., 2013a). Furthermore, reduced herder mobility has increased the pressure on forests resulting in increased logging for fuel and construction wood and reduced regeneration due to browsing damage by increasing goat populations (Khishigjargal et al., 2013; Dulamsuren et al., 2014)."

In India, climate change is also predicted to lead to boundary changes in areas suitable for growing certain crops (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2016). A study in Bangladesh revealed a shift in crop choices among farmers, implying changes in the future rice-cropping pattern. Specifically, a temperature increase will compel farmers to choose irrigation-based Boro, Aus and other crops in favour of the rain-fed Aman rice crop (Moniruzzaman, 2015)."

Also in Bangladesh, a study on predicting the design of water requirements for winter paddy rice under climate change conditions shows that agricultural water resource management will help minimise drought risk and implement future agricultural water resource policies (Islam et al., 2018) that may have important implications for crop areas and production."

A study on projected irrigation requirements under climate change using a soil-moisture model for 29 upland crops in the Republic of Korea showed that water scarcity is a major limiting factor for sustainable agricultural production (Hong et al., 2016). In terms of drought, despite increasing future precipitation in most scenarios, crop-specific agricultural drought is expected to be a significant risk due to rainfall variability (Lim et al., 2019a). On the other hand, a projected rise in water availability in the Korean Peninsula using multiple regional climate models and evapotranspiration methods indicates that it will likely  increase agricultural productivity for both rice and corn, but would decrease significantly in rain-fed conditions (Lim et al., 2017b).

In Japan, the projected decline in rice yield in some areas suggests that the current rice-producing regions would be divided into suitable and unsuitable areas as temperatures increases (Ishigooka et al., 2017), with important implications regarding the possible shift in cropping area. Similarly, it has been shown that there will be change in the geographic distribution of the occurrence of poor skin colour of table-grape berries (Sugiura et al., 2019) and suitable areas for cultivation of subtropical citrus (Sugiura et al., 2014) in Japan by the middle of the 21st century."

Increasing evidence from sub-regions and individual countries suggests that climate-related hazards, such as increasing temperature, changing rainfall, SLR, drought, flooding and the more frequent and intense occurrences of El Niño–Southern Oscillation events, all impact agricultural production with significant effects on food security. All these hazards interact with non-climatic factors, such as competing demand for scarce water resources, rural–urban migration, food prices and increasing food demand in the long term, and poor governance, among other things, that may worsen food insecurity in the region (Montesclaros and Teng, 2021)."

Also vulnerable are flood-prone areas like the Vietnam Mekong River Delta where 39% of the total rice area is exposed to sustained flood risks (Wassmann et al., 2019a). Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation levels will persist to be important vulnerability drivers that will shape agricultural productivity particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central Asia as well as in selected areas of the region. With the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events, such as strong typhoons in the Philippines, the agriculture sector in the typhoon-prone areas of Southeast and East Asia, as well as the Indus Delta, will be more vulnerable to crop destruction (Mallari and Ezra, 2016).

Moreover, a recent vulnerability assessment of Korean aquaculture based on predicted changes in seawater temperature and salinity according to RCP8.5 indicated that vulnerability was highest for seaweed, such as laver and sea mustard, while fish, shrimp and abalone are relatively less vulnerable as they are less sensitive to high water temperature and their farming environments are controllable to a large extent (Kim et al., 2019a).

In a recent systematic and comprehensive review of farmers’ adaptation practices in Asia, Shaffril et al.

Site-specific adaptations, such as those in Pakistan, include farmers’ utilisation of several adaptation techniques which include changing crop type and variety, and improving seed quality; fertiliser application and use of pesticides, and planting of shade trees; and water storage and farm diversification (Fahad and Wang, 2018), as well as the implementation of comprehensive climate information services for farming communities (World Meteorological Organization, 2017)."

Fishers’ strong sense of belonging to their place of residence and the sense of responsibility to protect the vulnerable fish stock has been advantageously used for developing cooperatives and starting community-based fisheries management (FAO, 2012; ILO, 2015; Shaffril et al., 2017), and these initiatives have yielded positive results."

Strategies like polyculture, integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) and recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have been suggested to increase aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability and climate change adaptability (Ahmed et al., 2019c; Tran et al., 2020).

Cities in areas highly exposed and vulnerable to multiple hazards were also the ones that grew rapidly in population between 1950 and 2014, implying greater infrastructural investments in climate-sensitive areas. Among 27 cities highly exposed to multiple disasters, 13 cities had a population of 1 million or more in 2014. Among them were three megacities, Tokyo (Japan), Osaka (Japan) and Manila (the Philippines), with more than 10 million inhabitants exposed to three or more hazards. Seven other cities with 1 million inhabitants or more in Asia were at high risk of three or more types of disaster. Manila is highly vulnerable to economic losses and disaster-related mortality from all six types of disasters. Moscow (Russia) is the only megacity not exposed to the risk of any of the six types of physical hazards analysed (cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcano eruptions).

By the end of the century, under higher projections (RCP8.5), the daily maximum wet-bulb temperature is expected to exceed the survivability threshold across most of South Asia (Im et al., 2017). City-specific studies articulate what these regional projections will mean for urban populations. For example, at 1.5°C warming, without adaptation, annual heat-related mortality in 27 major cities across China is projected to increase from 32.1 per million inhabitants annually in 1986–2005 to 48.8–67.1 per million. This number increases to 59.2–81.3 per million for 2°C warming (Wang et al., 2019a).

There is medium evidence (high agreement ) that urban water insecurity is experienced differentially based on income, risk exposure, and assets, and that urban drought and water scarcity is causing material and non-material losses and damage (Singh et al., 2021a). Importantly, in several Asian cities, flood and drought risk is expected to occur concurrently, especially in South Asia which is projected to see the largest increase in urban land exposed to both floods and droughts (25–32% increase in flood and drought risk between 2000 and 2030)."

Twelve of the top 20 countries exposed to SLR and associated flood events are in Asia, and of these, China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure (Neumann et al., 2015; Edmonds et al., 2020). Critically, regardless of the emissions scenario, 70% of the global population exposed to SLR and land subsidence are in eight Asian countries: China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Japan (Kulp and Strauss, 2019). This is particularly worrisome since in highly populated low-lying coastal cities across Asia, it is estimated that land subsidence could be as influential as climate-induced SLR over the 21st century (Cao et al., 2021; Nicholls et al., 2021). In East Asia and the Asia–Pacific in general (expected to see 0.2–0.5 m SLR), without adaptation, 1 million people (range of 0.3–2.2 million) are projected to be affected by submergence under RCP8.5 by 2095. Limiting warming will reduce this risk, and under RCP4.5, these numbers of people at risk will be reached by 2140. However, continuing on RCP8.5 increases risk exposure to 7 million (estimated range of 2–24 million people) (Haasnoot, 2021). Notably, assuming present-day population and adaptation (in the form of existing protection standards), East and South Asia already have a large number of people at risk of a 1-in-100-years flooding event (63 million) because of relatively lower flood protection (except in China and Malaysia)."

Such migration will have direct development implications: for example, destination locations could see additional demands on jobs (594,000), housing (197,000) and food (783 × 109 calories) by mid-century as a result of those displaced by SLR (Davis et al., 2018)."

Guangzhou, China, is estimated to be the most economically vulnerable city in the world to SLR by 2050, with estimated losses of 254 million USD yr –1 under 0.2 m SLR (Jevrejeva et al., 2016). With a 2°C warming, Guangzhou is expected to see SLR of 0.34 m; under 5°C warming, this number would rise to 1.93 m. A more recent estimate calculates expected damage in Guangzhou due to SLR under RCP8.5 to reach 331 billion USD by 2050 and 420 billion USD under the high-end scenario with figures doubling by 2070. By 2100, expected damage could reach 1.4 trillion USD under RCP8.5 and 1.8 trillion USD under the high-end scenario. Similarly, in Mumbai (India) SLR damages amount to US$ 112–162 billion by 2050 and could increase by a factor of 2.8–2.9 by 2070 (Abadie et al., 2020). In coastal cities such as Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, projected land subsidence rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction, are comparable to, or exceed, expected rates of SLR, resulting in an additional 0.2 m SLR by 2025 (Jevrejeva et al., 2016). In Shanghai, current annual damage by coastal inundation is estimated at 0.03% of local GDP; under RCP4.5, this increases to 0.8% by 2100 (uncertainty range of 0.4–1.4%) and is further exacerbated by land subsidence and socioeconomic development (Du et al., 2020). It is important to note that these projections assume (a) no adaptation and (b) that damage repairs are undertaken and completed annually.

Similarly, for households, the direct impact and cost of coping could be between 2.3 and 190 billion USD yr –1.

Asian cities are also focusing on institutional adaptation measures which cut across the five categories mentioned above such as through building capacity and local networks (Anguelovski et al., 2014; Friend et al., 2014; Knowlton et al., 2014), improving awareness (Knowlton et al., 2014), and putting local research and monitoring mechanisms in place (Lee and Painter, 2015) to enable adaptation. Figure 10.9 shows the effectiveness of select adaptation options in cities across Asia."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The challenge of adapting infrastructure to climate change across Asia is twofold: there are significant infrastructure deficiencies, especially in low-income countries, and key infrastructures are at high risk due to climate change (Hallegatte et al., 2019; Lu, 2019). Infrastructural adaptation options in cities attempt to enable networked energy, water, waste and transportation systems to prepare for, and deal with, climate risks better (Meerow, 2017) through interventions such as improved highways and power plants, climate-resilient housing, improved water infrastructure and so forth (ADB, 2014)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Infrastructural measures alone are seldom effective in building urban resilience as seen in the examples of the 2011 floods in Bangkok and the 2005 typhoon in Manila (Duy et al., 2019), or projected estimates by Pervin et al. (2020) who found that structural interventions in existing drainage systems reduce flooding risk by 7–19% in Sylhet (Bangladesh) and Bharatpur (Nepal); however, without proper solid waste management, areas under flood risk could increase to 18.5% in Sylhet and 7.6% in Bharatpur in five years, rendering the infrastructural interventions ineffective over time. While in some cities it is estimated that infrastructural adaptation through ‘hard’ flood protection strategies (e.g., storm surge barriers and floodwalls) is more effective than institutional or ecosystem-based adaptation by 2100, for example, Shanghai. A hybrid approach where hard strategies protect from flood risk, and soft strategies reduce residual risk from hard strategies, is suggested (Du et al., 2020). In Japan, without adaptation, estimated damage costs of floods (caused by tropical cyclones and altered precipitation) by 2081–2100 under RCP2.6 will be 28% higher (compared with 1981–2000), rising to 57% higher under RCP8.5 (Yamamoto et al., 2021). With a combination of adaptation measures (such as land-use control, piloti building and flood control measures), estimated damage costs can be reduced even below the 1981–2000 levels, and with a combination of mitigation and these adaptation measures, an estimated 69% reduction in flood damage costs are expected–demonstrating the importance of concerted and immediate climate action in reducing damage."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Infrastructural interventions can sometimes be maladaptive when assessed over longer time periods: for example, the Mumbai Coastal Road (MCR) project aimed at reducing flood risk and protecting against SLR will potentially cause damages to intertidal fauna and flora and local fishing livelihoods (Senapati and Gupta, 2017); and Jakarta’s Great Garuda project aimed at reducing flood risk is expected to increase flood risk for the poorest urban dwellers (Salim et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Land use in cities impacts resource use (e.g., water, energy), risk (a function of population density, service provision and hazard exposure) and adaptive capacity, all of which influence the efficacy of urban adaptation (de Coninck et al., 2018). Locally suited land-use planning and regulation (such as appropriate zoning or building codes and safeguarding land rights) can have adaptation co-benefits (Mitchell et al., 2015; Dhar and Khirfan, 2016): for example, strict building regulations can protect urban wetlands and associated ecosystem services (Jiang et al., 2015); appropriate land zoning can safeguard green spaces, ensure improvements in permeability and obviate new development in risk-prone locations (Duy et al., 2019); and ensuring tenurial security or regularising informal settlements can incentivise improvements to housing quality, thereby alleviating vulnerability of the most marginal people (Mitchell et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Land tenure arrangements strongly shape urban dwellers’ vulnerability and their adaptive capacities (Roy et al., 2013; Michael et al., 2018). For example, in Khulna (Bangladesh), Roy et al. (2013) found significant differences between the adaptive strategies of homeowners and renters in low-income settlements, a finding echoed in Bangalore (India) (Deshpande et al., 2018) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) (Mitchell et al., 2015). In Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), land-based adaptation strategies include land zoning to control population and building density, demarcating environmental protection zones, and sub-urbanisation (Nahiduzzaman et al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2016). In many Asian cities, land subsidence control can serve as an adaptation strategy since it is estimated to significantly reduce relative SLR (high confidence). This has an important implication in that subsidence control would be a good and complementary measure to climate mitigation and climate adaptation in many coastal urban settings in Asia (Cao et al., 2021; Nicholls et al., 2021). Urban land-use planning, if used proactively, can incentivise adaptation–mitigation synergies and obviate unintended negative consequences of urbanisation as Xu et al. (2019) have shown in Xiamen."

This growing literature reflects the wide recognition that infrastructural adaptation can often have ecological and social trade-offs (Palmer et al., 2015) and need to be complemented by ecosystem-based actions to manage risk more effectively (Du et al., 2020), build adaptive capacity, and in some cases, meet mitigation and SDGs (Huang et al., 2020)."

wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The EbA approaches to manage floods, capture and store rainwater, restore urban lakes and rivers, and reduce surface runoff often blend infrastructural and ecosystem-based approaches. For example, in Tokyo, stormwater management is done by sophisticated underground infrastructure and an artificial infiltration stormwater system (Saraswat, 2016; Mishra et al., 2019 ). China’s Sponge City Programme aims to reduce the impacts of flooding through low-impact development measures, urban greenery and drainage infrastructure, such that 80% of urban areas reuse 70% of rainwater by 2020, which would help ensure the resilience of these cities to floods (Li et al., 2016b; Stip et al., 2019)."

Furthermore, urban EbA is constrained by a range of factors such as inadequate institutional structures and processes for connecting different remits and knowledge systems along with trade-offs in land use for different purposes (Mabon and Shih, 2021; Singh et al., 2021b)."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"The EbA interventions are not uniform across Asian cities: in a global study on urban EbA, Brink et al. (2016) found that Eastern Asia, India and Israel report most EbA interventions and that there is variable and limited evidence on effectiveness and scalability (SM10.5). Using a risk framing (i.e., the extent to which an option reduces risk), urban EbA options in Asian cities score as being ‘low to medium’ effective (see SM10.5); however, when the assessment is expanded to include the ecosystem benefits, economic impacts and human well-being co-benefits of EbA, effectiveness increases. Figure 10.10 shows evidence of the effectiveness of EbA."
wg2_ch10_10.4.6.4.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"For example, urban agriculture is identified as offering multiple benefits such as mitigating emissions associated with food transportation from rural to urban areas, improving food and nutritional security, strengthening local livelihoods and economic development, improved microclimate, soil conservation, improved water and nutrient recycling, and efficient water management (Padgham and Dietrich, 2015; Patil et al., 2019). However, it can potentially undermine ecosystem services through land-use changes, water overextraction or applying chemical fertilisers (Ackerman et al., 2014), exposure of smallholders to volatile markets and crops that are not consumed by farming households themselves (thus undermining food security) or increasing the work burdens on women, as well as health externalities (e.g. through use of untreated wastewater, or rearing poultry and livestock in unsanitary conditions). There remain gaps in understanding the differential impacts of urban agriculture at different scales as well as its effectiveness in improving adaptive capacity at scale."

In coastal cities, formal ‘retreat’ measures, such as forced displacement and planned relocation (Oppenheimer et al., 2019), are commonly considered ‘last resort’ adaptation strategies once other infrastructural and ecosystem-based protect-and-accommodate strategies are exhausted (CCP2.3) (Haasnoot et al., 2019). In contrast, migration (which can take various forms from seasonal, temporary mobility to circular or permanent movement) is a regular feature across Asian urban settlements (Box 10.2, CCB MIGRATE, Maharjan et al., 2020)."

While there is insufficient evidence to project migration numbers under different warming levels, it is well established that migration as an adaptation strategy is not equally available to all (Ayeb-Karlsson, 2020), and climatic risks might reduce vulnerable populations’ ability to move due to loss of assets, thus reinforcing existing inequalities and differential adaptive capacities (Blondin, 2019; Zickgraf, 2019; Singh and Basu, 2020; Cundill et al., 2021; Gavonel et al., 2021)."

Evidence on climate-driven internal migration shows that moving has mixed outcomes on risk reduction and adaptive capacity. On one hand, migration can improve adaptive capacity by increasing incomes and remittances as well as diversifying livelihoods (Maharjan et al., 2020); on the other, migration can expose migrants to new risks. For example, in Bangalore (India), migrants often face high exposure to localised flooding, insecure and unsafe livelihoods, and social exclusion, which collectively shape their vulnerability (Michael et al., 2018; Singh and Basu, 2020). In greater Manila (the Philippines) and Chennai (India), planned relocations to reduce disaster risk have often exacerbated vulnerability, due to relocation sites being in environmentally sensitive areas, inadequate livelihood opportunities and exposure to new risks (Meerow, 2017; Ajibade, 2019; Jain et al., 2021)."

Overall, there has been a growing emphasis on ‘build back better’ interventions (Mannakkara and Wilkinson, 2013; Hallegatte et al., 2018) that approach disaster management holistically through infrastructural solutions such as climate-resilient housing or sea walls and soft approaches such as strengthening livelihoods, developing EWS11, 10  increasing awareness about disaster risks and impacts, and building local capacities to deal with them (Bhowmik et al., 2021). Notably, urban disaster management is effective when land-use planning processes, including greenfield development, zoning and building codes, and urban redevelopment, are leveraged to reduce and/or obviate risk, thereby averting potential maladaptation (Kuhl et al., 2021)."

Both firms and governments need to take disaster risks into consideration in supply-chain management to avoid disruptions and subsequent negative effects (Abe and Ye, 2013). There are several institutional challenges faced during DRR and CCA implementation including overlapping efforts and inefficient use of scarce resources due to inappropriate funding mechanisms, a lack of coordination and collaboration, a lack of implementation and mainstreaming, scale mismatches, poor governance, the social–political–cultural structure, competing actors and institutions, and lack of information, communication, knowledge sharing, and community involvement, as well as policy gaps (Seidler et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2020)."

Public private partnership (PPP) too is receiving increasing focus, especially with regard to climate-related cost-effective and innovative infrastructure projects. In the absence of major investments in resilience, climate change may force up to 77 million people into a poverty trap by 2030 (World Bank, 2016). As seen in the case of Japan, most of the countries in Asia face the challenge of contractual allocation of risks associated with natural hazards and climate change between the public and private sectors and its long-term management in the face of uncertainty. Risk sharing, therefore, could be addressed by clear definition and allocation (World Bank, 2017). Given that in Asia, especially Singapore, China, Japan and Republic of Korea, where the water sector is a target of industrial and technology policy, PPPs could prove to be mutually beneficial. As a middle ground, key findings of a study on Indonesia (Yoseph-Paulus and Hindmarsh, 2016) underline the importance of building, sustaining and augmenting local capacity by addressing inadequacies with regard to resource endowment and capacity building, public awareness about climate change, government–community partnerships, vulnerability assessment and providing inclusive decision-making spaces to Indigenous knowledge systems and communities."

Similarly, a case study of the Gandak basin in Nepal showed that incorporation of local knowledge into agricultural practices and weather warning systems works best when coupled with multiple sources of information based on a method of triangulation. This also intersects with gender outcomes, where women frequently receive information from the men of their households rather than directly from state institutional sources (Acharya and Prakash, 2019). Climate-change adaptive governance is facilitated by improved cross-scalar and cross-sectoral cooperation, exchange of information and experiences, and best practices (Smith et al., 2014; Watts et al., 2015; Gamble et al., 2016; Gilfillan et al., 2017)."

Correspondingly, this category achieved higher levels of income and food security. The climate-development nexus suggests that CCA practices at the farm level can have significant development outcomes, besides reducing risk posed by changing weather patterns. Central to the CCA process is the growing recognition of the role that institutions play in both the hierarchical setting and across different scales to influence implementation of CCA in diverse areas of governance across social and political domains.

The promise of diversification of livestock animals (within species), crop diversification and transition to mixed crop–livestock systems needs to be further explored. A study of livestock farmers in Pakistan showed that risk-coping mechanisms, such as purchasing livestock insurance and increasing land areas for fodder, are far more rewarding policy options in comparison with selling livestock and migrating to another place. Relatedly, the association of migration with adaptation measures is context specific and involves a number of factors pertaining to the socioeconomic circumstances of vulnerable agricultural groups in countries like India and Bangladesh (Ojha et al., 2014). In the 2010 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Cancun Adaptation Framework, migration was recognised as a form of adaptation that should be included in a country’s long-term adaptation planning where appropriate (Paragraph 14 f)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Furthermore, agricultural climate-adaptation policy targeting livestock farmers in rural areas is very likely  to benefit from better education and awareness as well as increased access to extension services among livestock farmers on climate risk-coping choices and strategies (Rahut and Ali, 2018). In Myanmar, the lack of adequate agricultural extension strategies has had a negative impact on adaptation outcomes in what is labelled the ‘central dry zone’. Farmers’ perceptions of climate change contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the context where they identify deforestation and related activities as the main culprits. Their adaptive methods include agricultural land preparation and crop rotation practices in addition to rainwater-harvesting techniques (Swe et al., 2015). A study of vulnerable areas in Bangladesh (Alam et al., 2017) has shown that with policy support, livestock rearing can prove to be a viable substitute for crop production in areas prone to riverbank erosion. Carefully developed partnerships between government organisations and NGOs can come to the rescue of poor farmers and their precarious households by providing information about best practices for local adaptation strategies, including credit options with various institutions and creating an enabling environment for the promotion of agro-based industries. A study in community forestry in the Indian Himalayan region (Gupta and Koontz, 2019) has shown how the synergies and successful partnerships could evolve between government and NGOs in local forest governance, with the former providing technical and financial support, and the latter directing the communities to those resources, and in the making up for each other’s limitations thereby enabling and augmenting community efforts in forest governance."

The possibilities more incorporating deliberative methods into wider governance architecture are also expanded through an acknowledgment of the role of social learning; this is observable in the multi-stakeholder involvement that this approach fosters in regions of South Asia such as the Brahmaputra River basin (Varma and Hazarika, 2018). Additionally, recent studies have reconfirmed the importance of linking Indigenous knowledge with the scientific knowledge of climate change in diverse regions of the globe, including Asia and Africa (Hiwasaki et al., 2014; Etchart, 2017; Taremwa et al., 2017; Vadigi, 2017; Apraku et al., 2018; Inaotombi and Mahanta, 2018; Makondo and Thomas, 2018) for building farmers’ resilience, enhancing CCA, ensuring cross-cultural communication, promoting local skills, drawing upon Indigenous Peoples’ intuitive thinking processes and geographic knowledge of remote areas."

There is a need to assuage the perceptions of distrust in global information, through governance methods that engage multiple stakeholders in open and lucid channels of communication (Stott and Huq, 2014). This is observable in the structure of the New Urban Agenda which formed part of the SDGs pertaining to cities and has been shaped by a bottom-up process marked by diverse participation including communities, experts and activists, rather than the top-down variant that is observable in the Millenium Development Goals (Barnett and Parnell, 2016). This approach could also be evidenced in the Paris Agreement, which placed the onus of a successful global governance regime on the development of efficient systems of regional governance. However, these emerging systems of regional governance could equally pose a challenge to the global governance in a way that can be witnessed through the development of financial groups such as the BRICS (associated economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which resulted from a perception of inadequate institutional transformation at the global level. From another perspective, a comprehensive approach would require simultaneous implementation of both bottom-up and top-down models of governance, retaining flexibility of scale."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Given the concerns surrounding food security, especially in light of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, under the NDCs submitted by South Asian nations under the Paris Agreement, emission reduction commitments are less likely  to include the agriculture sector. Prospects for enhancing both adaptive capacity and food security could be improved by strengthening resilience and profitability through the introduction of a basket of policy choices and actions including structural reforms, agriculture value-chain interventions and landscape-level efforts for climate resilience. Correspondingly, the substantial adaptation finance gap could be closed with the help of both private finance (autonomous adaptation) and international financial transfers (Amjath-Babu et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"For nearly five decades, integrated coastal management (ICM), advocated by several international organisations (e.g., IMO, UNEP, WHO, FAO) and adopted by over 100 countries, has been acknowledged as a holistic coastal governance approach aimed at achieving coastal sustainability and reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities in the face of multiple environmental impacts (high confidence). In view of threats posed to coastal ecological integrity by climate-change-induced tropical storm activity, accelerated SLR and littoral erosion and social–ecological impacts on the livelihood security of vulnerable coastal communities, the pressing need for approaches that innovatively combine coastal zone management and CCA measures is widely acknowledged (Rosendo et al., 2018) yet under researched. A study focusing on the three coastal cities of Xiamen, Quanzhou and Dongying, in China, a country with nearly 12% of its national coastline already covered under the ICM governance framework, suggests that whereas the ICM approach has been found to be effective in promoting the overall sustainability of China’s coastal cities (Ye et al., 2015) using accurate and reliable data, in addition, the developing unified standards could usefully reveal changing conditions and parameters related to ICM performance."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Steadily the regional scale of climate adaptive governance is acquiring salience in diverse sub-regions of Asia, and more policy-oriented empirical research is needed on how various regional forums, agencies and multilateral organisations could further contribute by way of in-house expertise and other resources, including financial. A study of climate adaptation in the health sector in Southeast Asia (Gilfillan, 2018) highlights the growing role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Asia-Pacific Regional Forum on Health and Environment, and shows that their mandates and goals could mutually benefit from the institutionalisation of coordination mechanism. An example from the Maldives shows that the 2014 Tsunami, climate change and the risk of extreme weather events have led to the legitimisation of state-led population resettlement programmes. In China, this has occurred through the renaming of previously existing resettlement initiatives as climate adaptation initiatives; however, the efficacy of resettlement as a CCA measure requires further scrutiny (Arnall, 2019). In India, the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change has been instituted in order to enable states to implement adaptation programmes; however, this does not address the question of mainstreaming CCA into designs for development (Prasad and Sud, 2019). This is closely related to the development of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) where the mainstreaming of adaptation within countries has been an important concern. Insights from developing countries indicate that there is still much ground to cover. The NAPA of the Maldives prioritises food security, coastal resources and public health, while Nepal has prioritised ecosystem management and public health, and food security, among other concerns (Saito, 2013). Importantly, Bangladesh’s NAPA has shown that there is potential for ‘reflexivity’ in the integration of adaptation objectives with sectoral objectives (Vij et al., 2018). Conspicuous by their absence are the transboundary-scale adaptation policies in South Asia (Vij et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"A distinguishing feature of the case of Japanese apple growers is the co-existence of both top-down and bottom-up adaptation practices. The former pertains to farmers who rely on the support of the cooperative for agricultural support and follow institutional mechanisms. The latter pertains to non-co-op farmers who have been responsible for innovative practices of cultivation such as the shift to peaches and the sale in the market of apples without leaf-picking. Importantly, the non-co-op group also have access to sales channels that may not be accessible to the former owing to their direct interactions with customers, among other factors (Fujisawa and Kobayashi, 2011; Fujisawa et al., 2015). The significance of this combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches to agricultural adaptation practices may be further sharpened by formulating approaches for Asia and the Pacific region in ways that contribute to the fortification of food security objectives and the idea of co-benefits. This may be carried out by enhancing the ability of farmers to better manage cultivation practices in the context of climatic variability (FAO, 2018d)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"There exist numerous barriers to the mainstreaming of CCA measures across Asia. The integration of CCA into the dissemination of localised climatic information and its uptake and implementation through institutional policy arrangements remain areas of concern (Cuevas, 2018). Institutional incentives to agricultural production, for instance, are frequently compounded by the negative impacts they have on existing bases of natural resources. The disconnected operations of local governmental agencies coupled with inadequacies of cross-sectoral coordination further highlights the prevalent food–water–energy nexus (Rasul, 2016). One possible way of addressing these intersecting sources’ complexity is by locating emerging CCA measures in educational development. The introduction of CCA thinking into land-use planning in the Philippines is an example of the successful role of enhancing public education and awareness through the dissemination of information by institutional channels. The linkages between the strength of local leadership and the inclusion of CCA in localised planning activities are also well illustrated by the case study of Cuevas (2018)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.1.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"As shown in the case of Pakistan, level of education shares a positive relationship with the implementation of adaptation measures (Ali and Erenstein, 2017). However, a closer examination of the educational imperatives that drive CCA in ways that improve the representational architecture of adaptation actions through a focus on gender is needed. Mainstreaming of gender into CCA would involve addressing a host of barriers to education and involvement that are often rooted in the differential structures of households, social norms and roles, and the domestic division of labour (Rao et al., 2019). A study from the Indian state of Bihar shows that gender plays a major role in determining intra-household decision making and also inhibits the ability of female-headed households to establish access to agricultural extension services (Mehar et al., 2016). Even within wider female farmer-operated federations, such as the Bangladesh Kishani Sabha (BKS), the barriers to participation stem from social factors that include the limitation of female mobility through the gendered division of labour and a lack of recognition of female agency (Routledge, 2015). Gendered inequalities in educational attainment and outcomes viewed through the lens of social vulnerability thus intersect with environmental vulnerabilities in ways that affect the ability of women to participate in CCA, owing also to a lack of access to health and sanitation facilities. These factors have a direct impact on the ability of adaptation to be effective in the global South, and are especially important in the context of the commitments of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women countries to the objective of gender equality (Roy, 2018)."

Ensuring water and food security with economic growth, environmental sustainability, climate resilience, vulnerability reduction to natural hazards and minimising different challenges of the delta through robust, adaptive and integrated strategies, and equitable water governance, are the mission of this mega plan. Under this mission, three higher-level goals and six specific goals have been determined. Three higher-level goals include elimination of extreme poverty by 2030, achievement of upper middle-income status by 2030 and becoming a prosperous country beyond 2041. Six specific goals of BDP 2100 are fully linked with SDG Goals 2, 6, 13 and 14 and partially linked with Goals 1, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 15. These specific goals comprise a wide range of issues, including land and water resources, climate change, disaster, wetlands and ecosystems, river systems and estuaries. The vision, mission and goals of BDP 2100 reveal that this mega plan is a holistic and integrated approach considering diversified themes and sectors for the whole country.

wg2_ch10_10.5.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Much like any other field, CCA is greatly facilitated by science, technology and continuous innovation. These range from the application of existing science, to the development of new scientific tools and methods, to the utilisation of Indigenous knowledge and citizen science. Many of the pressing problems in Asia, including water scarcity, rapid urbanisation, loss of natural habitats, biodiversity, rising coastal and river basin hazards, and agricultural loss can be effectively minimised through the adoption of suitable scientific and technological methods. Despite the current challenges in the region, many significant advances in science and technology have been made, and the future prospects look bright. The following sections outline the present status and future prospects of science and technology in scaling up adaptation actions in four key sectors, namely (a) DRR, (b) urbanisation, (c) water and agriculture, and (d) forests and biodiversity."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technological advances have enhanced the capabilities of Asian countries to monitor and prepare for climate-related hazards. Remote sensing technologies and GIS are widely used for DRR (Kato et al., 2017), for example, to assess and mitigate risks of an area to potential climate-related disasters (Wu et al., 2018b). The potential impacts of different types of hazards can be visualised using interactive maps (Lee, 2017), which help local communities to understand risks and find appropriate evacuation areas (Cadiz, 2018). These maps provide a situational overview and instant risk assessment (Yang et al., 2012b). As an emerging technology, artificial intelligence (AI) can identify conditioning factors of a landslide disaster (Hong et al., 2019b). Mobile virtual reality is used for disaster mitigation training through a three-dimensional visualisation of a past disaster (Ghosh et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"A community-based DRR system provides risk investigation, training and information analysis (Liu et al., 2016b). Sharing information enhances establishment of such a system and contributes to disaster prevention (Nakamura et al., 2017). One example is an online mapping tool, which has been developed by volunteers (Sakurai and Thapa, 2017). Social media enables the population to access real-time information on a disaster (Ghosh et al., 2018), raises situation awareness (Yin et al., 2012) and empowers communities towards appropriate emergency actions (Leong et al., 2015). Among the various forms of social media, Twitter is widely used as a social sensor to detect what is happening in a disaster event (Sakaki et al., 2013). Accuracy of information on Twitter has been proved in collecting local details about floods (Shi et al., 2019b); however, it has been noticed that Twitter generates rumours as well (Ogasahara et al., 2019). Artificial intelligence is expected to reduce human error when they operate a decision-making system (Lin et al., 2018). Since technologies supporting DRR completely depend on electricity, the loss of power supply and communication constrains the recovery work in disaster-affected areas (Sakurai et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"In the urban sector, a wide variety of sensor technologies are being used to monitor urban land-use and climate changes over time, and to better understand the potential impacts of future changes. These sensors range from large optical–thermal–radar satellite instruments with (near) global coverage–for example, Landsat (US Geological Service), Sentinel (European Space Agency), ALOS (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and MethaneSAT–to portable sensors embedded in mobile phones (e.g., phone cameras or temperature sensors) whose data are collected into centralised databases through crowdsourcing (Fenner et al., 2017; Meier et al., 2017). To combine and extract useful information from these heterogeneous sensor data–for example, for conducting climate risk assessments (Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Bechtel et al., 2019) and/or simulations of future land-use or climate changes in urban areas (Bateman et al., 2016; Iizuka et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017c)–AI technologies (e.g., machine-learning algorithms) are now being widely adopted (Johnson and Iizuka, 2016; Joshi et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2017). Thanks to advances in cloud-computing technology, which allows for online processing of massive volumes of remote sensing data, high-resolution (~30 m) global urban-area maps from the late 1990s to 2018 are now available from several different sources (Gong et al., 2020). Using these historical maps, researchers have been able to generate maps of future urban land-use changes at the global level to 2100 (Chen et al., 2020a), which can help to elucidate the potential impacts of this future urban expansion and identify adaptation needs. Technology also plays a major role in urban planning and design in the context of adaptation. To mitigate rising urban temperatures and reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards, many new ‘grey’ infrastructure and ‘green’ infrastructure technologies are being adopted in urban areas in Asia, for example, cool (i.e., high solar reflectance) rooftops and pavements as well as green (i.e., vegetated) rooftops to mitigate high temperatures; and porous pavements to mitigate flooding (Akbari and Kolokotsa, 2016)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The majority of the Asian region is experiencing water stress in terms of both quantity and quality, due to poor management systems and governance. This has dire consequences for the national GDP as the majority of the population belongs to agrarian communities and their water-dependent agriculture system. Despite a substantial investment and progress in research and development, and capacity building in the recent past, the majority of developing countries in Asia are struggling to manage both water resources and agriculture sectors heavily dependent  on water resources, in response to rapid global changes. Considering the frequent extreme weather conditions, progress in management tasks is even more consequential; hence, critically important for these countries, to achieve better CCA, are advanced science and technology viz. smart agriculture, robust EWS using downscaled meteorological information, a participatory approach, IWRM and so forth."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Having scientific knowledge relevant at the local scale through placed knowledge is important to identify climate-change risk and vulnerability. Moreover, once integrated with socioeconomic attributes, it can be useful for natural resource management, agriculture and so forth (Leith and Vanclay, 2017). Role of big data and data mining is undeniably very huge to get reliable climatic information and hence for designing appropriate adaptation measures for natural resource measurement. For example, use of big data in terms of EWS and real-time observation data provides more accurate information on hydro-meteorological extreme weather conditions or hazards like drought and flood, and will help farmers and local governments to improve their perception and hence preparedness for better adaptation (Hou et al., 2017; Ong and G.L.B.L., 2017). Using big data, different adaptation measures, such as new cultivar breeding, cropping-region adjustment, irrigation-pattern change, crop rotation and cropping-practice optimisation, are being designed in the agriculture sector, and these practices have greatly increased crop yield, leading to higher resource-use efficiency as well as greatly increased soil organic carbon content with reduced GHG emissions. It results in a win–win situation in terms of enhancing food security and mitigating climate warming (Deng et al., 2017). However, usability and application of this technology are still not common, especially in data-scarce regions. Integrated numerical simulations are efficient tools for estimating the current status and predicting the risk and efficiency of the adaptive capabilities of different countermeasures for sustainable natural resource management such as with water (Kumar, 2019). Similarly, the agent-based model is commonly used to estimate risk of food-borne diseases due to climate change, using tunable parameters such as hygiene level, the microorganism’s growth rate and the number of consumers, and hence it has the potential to be a useful tool for optimising decision making and urban planning strategies related to health and climate change (Gay Garcia et al., 2017). The integrated assessment model under the shared-socioeconomic pathway (SSP) framework is effectively used to estimate future energy development and possible mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions related to the energy sector (Bauer et al., 2017). Sound understanding of different drivers, pressures and stress factors, such as abnormal temperature, rainfall, insect pests or pathogens and their interaction pattern with the genetic makeup of crops, is the key to produce high-yielding varieties of wheat with better nutritional quality and resistance to major diseases (Goel et al., 2017). Another critical point to address this water security is inclusive, polycentric and adaptive governance. Polycentric governance is a means by which water management plans and policies should be framed and agreed by all relevant stakeholders. For adaptive governance, more emphasis will be on finding the best pathways to make robust water management plans amid rapid global changes. The benefit of such plans should reach the end users in terms of providing clean water, protection from hydrological hazards and maintaining the health of the ecosystem. In addition, there is urgent need for co-management, which includes the cycle of co-design, co-implementation and co-delivery throughout the whole water cycle. The best suitable example is using the circulating and ecological sphere (CES) approach. The CES is a concept that complements and supports regional resources by building broader networks, which are composed of natural connections (connections among forests; city and countryside; groundwater, rivers and the sea) and economic connections (human resources, funds and others), thus complementing each other and generating synergy (Mavrodieva and Shaw, 2020). Another suitable example for managing water resources is the participatory watershed land-use management (PWLM) approach. The PWLM is another very innovative and successful approach for more robust water resource management as explained by Kumar et al. (2020). It helps to make land-use and CCA policies more effective at the local scale. This is an integrative method using both participating tactics and computer-simulation modelling for water resource management at the regional scale."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Technologies and their applications to identify habitat degradation, ecosystem functions and biodiversity conservation are increasing in Asia, with many countries looking to new and improved means for forest and biodiversity monitoring and conservation. In particular, there has been an impressive use of temporal satellite data, particularly from the Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) series for widespread monitoring of forests and ecological resources. These series have provided reliable information on forests and ecosystem services at the country level, in difficult terrains, such as the mountains, cross-boundaries and otherwise inaccessible areas. For instance, Yin et al. (2017) estimated cross-boundary forest resources in Central Asia, a region which traditionally suffered from lack of reliable forest data, using remote sensing techniques. In a separate study, Reddy et al. (2020) used long-term MODIS forest fire data from 2003 to 2017 to characterise fire frequency, density and hotspots in South Asia. Archives of scientific data, backed by state-of-the art modelling techniques, advanced-computing methods and innovations in big-data analysis, particularly helped the provisioning of scientific research. A number of studies simulated forest futures from the local to the continent scale under different socioeconomic and climate scenarios. For instance, at the local scale, Dasgupta et al. (2018) projected the future extent of mangroves in the Sundarban Delta under four local scenarios, while Estoque et al. (2019) modelled and developed spatial maps of regional forest futures in Southeast Asia using the five SSP scenarios. Science and technology also helped the monitoring of species diversity and abundance, pivotal for sustaining an ecosystem and ecosystem-based adaptation. Digital camera traps and radio-collaring methods have largely replaced old film cameras and labour-intensive methods of photo screening to count target species (Pimm et al., 2015). This enhanced scientific capacities to monitor biodiversity and facilitate better conservation in difficult terrains, control poachers and maintain steady ecological balance. Umapathy et al. (2016), for example, used VHF radio collars and satellite-based tracking tools to monitor the movement of Bengal tigers over hostile island terrain. Photo recognition and other non-invasive techniques for individual identification have been rising in Asia. For example, a study by Gray et al. (2014) used faecal-DNA samples to estimate the population density of the Asian elephant in Cambodia. Furthermore, the advancement of citizen science programmes has greatly facilitated better monitoring of forest resources, including invasive floral and faunal species (Chandler et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2020). In Asia, citizen science has been used effectively in India (Chandler et al., 2017), and also in Malaysia for the monitoring urban bird abundance (Puan et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"With rapid advances of technologies, the use of appropriate technologies generates some degree of management problems. To resolve such problems, the enhancement of information science is essential to understand design, implementation and adoption of digital tools under crisis (Xie et al., 2020). For example, social media research reveals a way of controlling malicious information (Tanaka et al., 2014), and its characteristics under COVID-19–showing a plain text message–can be more powerful in the context of citizen engagement than media-rich communications (Chen et al., 2020b). Information behaviour needs more investigation to understand how people survive and connect in the era of information overload (Pan et al., 2020). Moreover, a new set of data (e.g., travel history record, personal health data, etc.) becomes an important base of DRR (Xie et al., 2020). Analysis of these personal data requires careful consideration, as it generates ethical issues (Sakurai and Chughtai, 2020). Indicators or measurements of technology-enabled crisis response needs to be developed for further risk reduction (Akbari and Kolokotsa, 2016; Wong et al., 2020). On the other hand, adopting infrastructure technologies requires investment, and due to the inherent uncertainties of climate projections, the future payoffs of these investments are also somewhat uncertain (Ginbo et al., 2020). In the water and infrastructure sectors, for example, various options exist for conducting cost–benefit analysis considering future uncertainty (i.e., so-called robust approaches, which are able to identify adaptation projects and infrastructure that can achieve their intended purpose(s) across a wide range of climate scenarios) (Dittrich et al., 2016). Despite substantial investment and progress in research, development and capacity building in the recent past, the majority of the developing countries in Asia are struggling to manage both water resources and the agriculture sector. Considering the frequent extreme weather conditions, progress in management tasks has become even more mammoth and, hence, we need a holistic solution, which is currently missing in field implementation. This solution should be based on advanced science and technology in association with other attributes like social, economic and political dynamics, which play a pivotal role in sustainable management of water resources and agriculture, as a way forward."

The IPCC’s Assessment Report 5 was critiqued for silences on how perceptions shape climate action and the behavioural drivers of adaptation responses (Lorenzoni and Whitmarsh, 2014). Addressing this gap and assessing the growing literature from social sciences, notably psychology, behavioural economics and risk perception studies, the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (de Coninck et al., 2018) comprehensively assessed behavioural dimensions of CCA for the first time; however, compared with studies on mitigation behaviour, the literature on what motivates adaptation remains incomplete (Lorenzoni and Whitmarsh, 2014; Clayton et al., 2015)."

Overall, there is growing acknowledgement that individual adaptation is significantly shaped by perceptions of risk, perceived self-efficacy (i.e., beliefs about which options are effective and one’s ability to implement specific adaptation interventions), sociocultural norms and beliefs within which adaptation decisions are taken, past experiences of risk management and the nature of the intervention itself (Grothmann and Patt, 2005; Werg et al., 2013; Clayton et al., 2015; Truelove et al., 2015; Pyhälä et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Sullivan-Wiley and Short Gianotti, 2017; Taylor, 2019; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019a).

Policies on providing early warnings of drought or information on prevention techniques shape farmer decisions to undertake adaptation interventions (Wang et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.3.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In disaster risk management, risk appraisal (Samaddar et al., 2014; Rauf et al., 2017; Hung et al., 2018), previous experience and losses (Said et al., 2015; Hung et al., 2018; Walch, 2018)12, 11  perceived probabilities and consequences (Reynaud et al., 2013), perceived self-efficacy (Ung et al., 2015; Hung et al., 2018) and awareness (Hung et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018a; Alvi and Khayyam, 2020) shape preparedness. Individual risk management is nested within public policies, such as those on flood management, which shape individual flood risk perception and protective behaviours (Reynaud et al., 2013) as well as personal factors such as religious beliefs (Alshehri et al., 2013). For example, communities often perceive disasters as ‘acts of God’ (Birkmann et al., 2019) or punishment for wrongdoings (Alshehri et al., 2013; Iqbal et al., 2018), which might constrain adaptive action. However, religious faith can also motivate people to prepare for extreme events, as Alshehri et al. (2013) showed in Saudi Arabia demonstrating how ‘Islam urges that it is most important to prepare the people to escape from disaster’ (p.1825)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.3.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Trust in public action as a mediator of risk management has had conflicting evidence: some studies have discussed trust as being critical to effective preparedness (Kittipongvises and Mino, 2015; Walch, 2018), while others have found that trust in public actions, such as structural interventions to mitigate flood impacts, can lower individual motivations to act since they feel protected (Hung et al., 2018)."

Crucially, those who do not believe in climate change can be influenced by social norms (Arunrat et al., 2017) thereby incentivising adaptation behaviour. While risk perception is a critical step in adaptation decision making, higher risk perception does not necessarily signal better capacity to cope: in Taiwan, Province of China, Sun and Han (2018) highlight how perceptions of climate risk as a global problem tends reduce its urgency as an individual issue. Providing information on climate risks, impacts and possible adaptation options enables adaptation behaviour (Piya et al., 2013; Zheng and Dallimer, 2016; Rauf et al., 2017), but information alone is not sufficient to motivate adaptive behaviour. Specifically, awareness building on concrete measures and outcomes, such as the amount of water saved or number of deaths averted, rather than abstract notions of climate change, motivate adaptation (Deng et al., 2017; Rauf et al., 2017)."

The developments are also clearly reported especially in the area of addressing the underestimates in adaptation costs that the previous studies suffered from as the previous studies tended to rely on data from wealthy economies (Hochrainer-Stigler et al., 2014; Carleton et al., 2020). The adaptation cost estimates have also improved since the previous IPCC reports due to constant improvements in capturing the loss and damages of disaster events (Hochrainer-Stigler et al., 2014). The reliance of earlier studies on correlations to derive adaptation costs was addressed to some extent by addressing the endogeneity of disaster measures (Kousky, 2014), especially by relying upon the physical measures of disasters such as wind speed, although more work is needed in this area."

Countries could differ widely in terms of the economic costs they face. In South Asia, the economic costs were projected to be 12.6% of the GDP for the Maldives, which is the highest among the South Asian countries, and 6.6% for Sri Lanka, the least among the South Asian countries.

Adaptation financing is crucial for supporting vulnerable countries and enhances adaptation, as it is evident that the enhanced adaptation finance support has positively affected the pace of adaptation in low-income countries (Ford et al., 2015).

Some of the important adaptation-targeted climate funds are Pilot Programmes for Climate Resilience, Green Climate Fund, and Least-Developed Countries Fund, and South Asian countries have significantly benefited from these dedicated climate funds. Due to the disaster implications of climate change, there is a need to allocate adaptation finances for DRR. Estimates suggest that East Asia and the Asia–Pacific in general allocated 27% of the total adaptation funds to DRR, while South Asia allocated 25% (Caravani, 2016).

In terms of the total resources available, a combination of public, private and bi- and multi-lateral funding could help the region to raise as much as 222.3–412.5 billion USD annually, with a possibility to reach higher amounts depending on the future economic growth of countries in the region.

wg2_ch10_10.5.4.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation cost estimates can vary between various studies due to the differences in methodologies they adopt. Some studies have conducted cost assessments using a combination of stakeholder consultations and quantitative modelling of climate-change impacts and adaptation (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014), while others depended solely on the quantitative modelling. Studies also differ in the coverage of sectors too: they either have focused on the multiple vulnerable sectors (Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014) or on a single sector (Hossain et al., 2019). Studies have differed in their estimates depending on their ability to take into consideration the transition costs of sudden adaptation (Hossain et al., 2019), the nature of social cost and/or damage functions employed (Arto et al., 2019), the discount rates applied (Markandya and González-Eguino, 2019) and consideration for the effects of GHG mitigation on adaptation needs (Duan et al., 2019a). In addition, the assumptions made on the pace of adaptation in estimating adaptation costs can make a difference in adaptation cost estimates. Adaptation at a slow or normal pace could require more adaptation finance, as large amounts of damage are not eliminated, than when adaptation is implemented at a faster rate (Markandya and González-Eguino, 2019). Although there have been improvements in adaptation cost estimates, there is a need to address the issue of endogeneity (Kousky, 2014; Samuel et al., 2019). The vast majority of studies that rely on databases, such as EM-DAT, tend to suffer from such endogeneity problems due to their inability to control the causality between GDP and damages (Kousky, 2014). Costs attributable to non-economic losses and damages are the least reported and least quantified in the adaptation costs literature due to lack of sufficient, robust and accessible methodologies (Chiba et al., 2017; Chiba et al., 2019; Serdeczny, 2019). This is a major limitation in assessing adaptation costs and financial needs, and it can lead to gross underestimation of adaptation costs.

This box reviews the adaptation literature across 51 countries in Asia on loss and damage (L&D), and adaptation barriers and limits, and identifies knowledge and regional gaps. The key messages are that (a) climate-induced L&D is already occurring across Asia (medium evidence, high agreement ), (b) these L&D are very likely  to increase at higher warming levels (medium evidence, high agreement ) and (c) measuring and attributing non-economic and intangible L&D remains a challenge (low evidence, high agreement )."

wg2_ch10_10.5.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Risk insurance approaches and tools have significantly evolved during recent years. The emphasis has been mainly on mitigating the adverse selection and moral hazard that have been the limitations of traditional area-based crop insurance approaches (He et al., 2019). This has been achieved by shifting the indemnity calculations on to the specific weather parameters and developing a weather index (Greatrex et al., 2015; Fischer, 2019). Technological applications in the development of insurance products have seen significant progress, including that of the blockchain and smart contracts (Gatteschi et al., 2018). There are technological developments in loss estimation, which has been a major limitation in the traditional insurance approaches in the past that either delayed the indemnity payment or misjudged the losses. Application of multi-model and multi-stage decision support systems has begun to make crop loss assessments for insurance more efficient (Aggarwal et al., 2020). Technological applications also include remote sensing (Di et al., 2017) and mobile phone app technologies (Meena et al., 2018) to provide accurate and quick damage assessments, and application of Internet-based indemnity approvals have enabled quick payment of indemnities (OECD, 2017b)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"As against financing post-disaster relief and reconstruction, which has been the norm of disaster management for decades in Asia, the evolution of ex-ante risk financing in the form of risk insurance has seen a steady rise globally and in Asia. The rise in popularity for risk financing in general and insurance in specific stem from the observation that governments have recognised the burden of mainly financing the post-disaster relief and reconstruction only (Juswanto and Nugroho, 2017; UNESCAP, 2018c; ADB, 2019), and from the realisation of cost savings and efficiency that risk financing for risk mitigation brings overall risk reduction (high agreement , medium evidence). As a result, a gamut of risk-financing instruments have been introduced to finance DRR and CCA initiatives in Asia among which risk insurance has gained prominence for it provides a low-cost and easy option for individuals, provides an opportunity for the governments to effectively engage the private sector in implementation and has the ability to inculcate risk-aware decision making at various levels (high agreement , medium evidence) (Hazell and Hess, 2017; UNESCAP, 2018c)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several Asian countries, including India, the Philippines and China, have a significant experience of offering agricultural insurance against typhoons, droughts and floods (Yang, 2018). For the most part, these insurance systems have followed a traditional indemnity-based insurance which faces several challenges in implementation including moral hazard and adverse selection, disagreements and delays in crop-damage assessments that relied upon crop-cutting experiments, often leading to a delay in processing indemnity payments, costly insurance premiums and poor insurance expansion (high agreement , robust evidence) (Patnaik and Swain, 2017; Ghosh et al., 2019). Other factors contributing to poor penetration of insurance include limited awareness on the importance of insurance, and poor access."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"To tackle the problem of costly insurance premiums, governments have subsidised the premiums (Ghosh et al., 2019). Premium subsidies have been reported to undermine the ability to convey the real cost of risks by the insured (price distortion), and have encouraged adverse selection and moral hazard (Nguyen and Jolly, 2019). On the contrary, subsidies have been suggested to address the issue of adverse selection associated with the insurance (Zhao et al., 2017c)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Despite the fact that the insurance programmes are able to obtain high participation rates due to subsidised premiums, their impact on farmers’ income seems to be insignificant especially under the conditions of low indemnities, low guarantee and wide coverage (Zhao et al., 2016a). The subsidy burden of insurance on national governments is found to be significant with an estimated equivalent of 6 billion USD spent by China alone on insurance (Hazell et al., 2017). In addition, the insurance programmes in Asian countries are reporting higher producer claim ratios, and often governments have to spend more than the money being transferred to the insured through the insurance programmes (Hazell et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"To address the issues associated with traditional indemnity insurance, efforts have been made to develop weather-index insurance in Asia that bases the payouts on the rainfall or temperature index, rather than on the direct damage measurements. The parametric insurance products help avoid the delays in insurance payouts as they are based on modelled risks, rather than actual damage measurements, and control the adverse selection and moral hazard, although basis risks could be increased due to improper matching of payouts with the index (De Leeuw et al., 2014). Index insurance is known to promote public–private partnerships that in turn will enhance the efficiency of overall programme delivery (Hazell and Hess, 2017). Several countries, including India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, either are currently piloting or expanding the weather-index insurance (Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2014; Tyagi and Joshi, 2019). Index insurance is constantly expanding with an estimated 194 million farmers already enrolled in China and India, which is much lower than the potential number of farmers it can reach (Hazell et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Few significant bottlenecks that are limiting the scaling up of weather-index insurance include lack of reliable weather data, low density of weather stations leading to high basis risk, and limited data on damage and hazard for parametric modelling of the insurance (Shirsath et al., 2019). Several innovations are being tried and tested to overcome the limitations associated with the index insurance which include developing multiscale index insurance, application of remote sensing, smartphone-based near-surface remote sensing and building insurance based on vegetation indices instead of relying on weather data alone (Hufkens et al., 2019). Alternative indices, such as the NDVI, are being tested for their applications in designing index-based insurance in India (IFAD, 2017). Agro-meteorology-based statistical analysis and crop growth modelling have been suggested to calibrate and rectify faulty weather indices (Shirsath et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019). Establishing automatic weather stations can improve data accuracy while preventing the delay in acquiring the weather data (Sinha and Tripathi, 2016). These technological applications have already started finding space within insurance programmes designed by national governments in Asia. For example, the government of India has released new operational guidelines for the application of new technologies such as drones, remote sensing and mobile phone apps in implementation of the national agricultural insurance, which is the third largest insurance in the world (Department of Agriculture, 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Despite these developments, several issues still seem to hinder the penetration of insurance in Asia. Issues such as lack of sufficient choices, lack of clear model, lack of legal support, limited or absence of proper monitoring and evaluation, and limited data for underwriters to properly evaluate claims have been suggested (Nguyen and Jolly, 2019). Low interest among the potential buyers due to unaffordable insurance premiums, lack of provision for partial-loss claim settlement, big hassles in the claim settlement process and lack of timely settlement of claims are reported (Parappurathu et al., 2017). In addition, insurance has been reported to have expanded the coverage of cash crops at the expense of drought-resistant subsistence crops with effects on natural capital and a potential increase in farmer’s vulnerability to market price fluctuations (Müller et al., 2017)."

Social protection that is well designed and implemented in a more long-term approach can enhance human capital and productivity, reduce inequalities, build resilience and empowerment, and end the inter-generational cycle of poverty (medium evidence, medium agreement ) as indicated from various experiences in the region such as (a) cash transfer programmes in Indonesia (Kwon and Kim, 2015), (b) the Benazir Income Support Programme in Pakistan (Watson et al., 2017), (c) the Chars Livelihoods Programme in Bangladesh (Pritchard et al., 2015) and (d) Minsei-in designated volunteer social workers in Japan (Boeckmann, 2016). A key consideration in strengthening resilience through SP programmes is to design with climate and disaster risk considerations in mind and implement in close synergy with existing programmes, such as on sustainable livelihoods, EWS and financial inclusion (Coirolo et al., 2013; Bank, 2018a)."

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of these sudden and slow-onset disasters, among them, hydrological changes in major river basins where 1.5 billion people live (such as the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, Tarim, Amu and Syr Darya rivers) (Bank, 2017a). According to the latest estimates of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), 55% of the global population (around 4 billion people) remain without any SP benefits, and the SP coverage gap is highest in Africa (82.2%) and the Asia–Pacific (61%) (ILO, 2017b)."

Stateless people are disproportionately affected by climate change and disasters as they tend to reside in hazard-prone areas and their statues as non-citizens often limits access to assistance (Connell, 2015). The three main types of SP are: (a) social safety nets (also known as social assistance), which include conditional and unconditional cash transfers, public work programmes, subsidies and food stamps; (b) social insurance, which consists of contributory pensions and contributory health insurance; and (c) labour market measures, which include instruments such as unemployment compensation (Bank, 2018b). The potential for an integrated adaptive SP is not yet harnessed by policymakers in tackling the structural causes of vulnerability to climate change (Tenzing, 2019). Public works programmes (i.e., India’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, MGNREGA) should take into account climate risk in planning and support development of community assets to increase collective resilience."

On another note, the Catastrophe Insurance Framework, the first model introduced in Shenzen, China, provides timely relief for citizens and operates as a safety net, particularly for the poorest residents who do not have disposable income to cover the costs associated with bodily injuries arising from disasters (Telesetsky and He, 2016).

However, additional research is still needed and new tools need to be developed to inform policy design and support the implementation of ‘green’ SP, as well as to measure the net-welfare impacts of such policies (Canonge, 2016). In order to enhance SP programmes, one of the cross-cutting issues is to discuss the linkages between gender roles and responsibilities, food security, agricultural productivity and the mediating role that SP programmes can have (Jones et al., 2017). Social protection has a potentially important role to play in contributing to food security and agricultural productivity in a gender-responsive way (Holmes and Jones, 2013). As such, experience from Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor programme in Bangladesh has promoted social innovation by creating social and economic values, fostering microenterprises, increasing food security and fostering inclusive growth, all while empowering ultra-poor women (Emran et al., 2014; Mahmuda et al., 2014). Although there is increasing evidence that SP programmes are having a positive impact in terms of reducing vulnerability in women’s everyday lives (Jones et al., 2017), the transformative impact of these programmes is rare due to limitations in recognising women’s access to productive inputs and resources (Tanjeela and Rutherford, 2018; Cameron, 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"On the other hand, poor governance practices affect delivery of SP programmes and the ability of beneficiary households to reap the benefits from such support (Sijapati, 2017). In Nepal, a closer look at public expenditure shows that about 60% of the SP budget is used by social insurance programmes that predominantly consist of public-sector pensions (Babken Babajanian, 2014; Koehler, 2014). Towards this end, more effort is needed to improve its existing programmes so that there is an equality of opportunities, along with secured human rights. The example from Nepal’s Child Grant is an indicative of an incremental approach to social policy (Garde et al., 2017). Meanwhile, in the Philippines, despite the existence of flagship national interventions that cover a significant number of people in need and have clear and robust implementation rules, there are still many programmes with overlapping mandates and target population, and several gaps in their monitoring systems (Bank, 2018b)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Having an integrated SP information system would allow policymakers to better monitor inputs, outputs and outcomes (e.g., who the beneficiaries are, what they are receiving, at what frequency, what the existing gaps are) (OECD, 2017a; Samad and Shahid, 2018). Based on evidence from the assessments of three countries (Mongolia, Nepal and Vietnam), the political and institutional arrangements (i.e., the software) is as important as the technical fixes (i.e., the hardware) in the success of using information and communication technology for delivering SP programmes (ADB, 2016). By 2050, climate-induced migration will likely  be a major policy aspect of the rural–urban nexus as slow-onset impacts of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America will likely  force over 143 million people to migrate within their national borders (Kumari Rigaud, 2018). This will have major implications for SP systems, and therefore national SP strategies should be designed to anticipate and address climate-induced internal mobility (Schwan and Yu, 2017). For instance, it does not offer a solution for maintaining Indigenous cultures which are often strongly affected by, or even disrupted by, climate change (Olsson, 2014). Hence, an effective approach needs to combine different policy instruments to support protection, adaptation and migration (O’Brien et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.6.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Evidently, SP has been financed typically through the combination of government tax revenues and official development assistance, and the challenges of the increasing frequency and intensity of natural and economic crises are straining these traditional financial sources (Durán-Valverde, 2020). In this context, innovative financing schemes are seen as critical to achieve the sustainable financing of SP (Asher, 2015; UNICEF, 2019) via social and solidarity economy, as seen in women’s autonomous adaptation measures in precautionary savings and flood preparedness in Nepal (Banerjee et al., 2019), and self-help groups as development intermediaries (Anderson, 2019). Still, there are constraints of SP to reach those who are most vulnerable to climate change and other hazards due to their legal status, such as the fact that attention to forcibly displaced populations within the SP field has been limited (Sabates-Wheeler, 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.6.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Government SP can attenuate the negative impacts in facing disasters, depending on the differences in political systems and the focus put on sociopolitical measures (medium evidence, medium agreement ), not only in restoring livelihoods but also in easing mental burdens faced by rural households in developing countries (Dalton et al., 2016; Kosec and Mo, 2017; Liebenehm, 2018). However, limited government capacities and fiscal feasibility may impede the expansion and effective implementation of SP as developing countries need further support to design, adjust and implement SP schemes effectively (Klonner, 2014; Schwan and Yu, 2017). Most countries have comprehensive strategies for both SP and climate change, but few have attempted to align them, as in practice they remain in separate institutional homes, governed by their own intra-sector coordination groups and funding channels (Steinbach et al., 2016; Bank, 2018b). Thus, significant knowledge gaps remain in terms of understanding the potential of SP to build long-term resilience to climate change (Ulrichs et al., 2019). Future efforts should be geared to develop climate-responsive SP policies that consider a broad range of issues including urbanisation and migration, the impact of green policies on the poor, access to essential health care and risks to socially marginalised groups (Aleksandrova, 2019). Along with strengthening links to climate information and EWS, finance for enabling SP systems to address climate-related shocks and stresses dynamically needs to be scaled up (Kuriakose et al., 2013; Ulrichs et al., 2019)."

Acknowledging the limitations in terms of capacity and coping mechanisms towards climate change, education, training and awareness building is central to sustaining long-term capacity building (Clemens et al., 2016). Education has a lot more to offer in terms of improvements in addressing climate change, particularly in the climate hotspots of Asia where mostly poor, disadvantaged communities vulnerable to climate change reside (Mani et al., 2018). In particular, when disseminated, climate-change awareness and information need more explanation (Steg et al., 2014; Wi and Chang, 2018; Cho, 2020). In addition, international and national support through institutions and financing is critical for successful capacity building (Hemachandra, 2019), which must be designed for the long term and be self-sustaining (Gustafson et al., 2018). National ownership by recipient countries and members of communities of capacity-building efforts is key to ensuring their success (Roberts and Pelling, 2016; Mikulewicz, 2017)."

Improving on, and investing in, basic education, climate literacy and location-based strategies of climate change are vital to enhance public engagement, societies’ adaptive capacity and support for climate action (Lutz et al., 2014c; Hu and Chen, 2016). As stated in the IPCC Special Report 1.5°C, sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity and promote livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations (Roy et al., 2018). Hence, various concepts are introduced to foster awareness, understanding, knowledge, participation as well as commitment towards managing climate change in a sustainable manner. One such concept is education for sustainable development (ESD), which is aimed at integrating the principles and practices of sustainable development in all aspects of education, and training individuals who will contribute to the realisation of a more sustainable society (Kitamura, 2017)."
wg2_ch10_10.5.7.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate-change education (CCE) is also now addressed in the context of ESD and allows for learners to understand the causes and consequences of climate change, and teaches them how to take action (Mochizuki and Bryan, 2015). Both ESD and CCE are gaining broader attention, for instance, in China (Han, 2015) and the Republic of Korea (Sung, 2015); however, development of policies and implementation of initiatives regarding ESD and CCE still face a handful of challenges which require a strong political will and consensus of key stakeholders (Læssøe and Mochizuki, 2015). Effective communication on CCE particularly for younger-generation engagement is also essential, as they are our future leaders as climate change is an inter-generational equity issue (Corner et al., 2015). Action for Climate Empowerment of Article 6 of the UNFCCC target youth as a major group for effective engagement in the formulation and implementation of decisions on climate change (UNFCCC, 2015). Increasing attention from countries in Asia, such as Thailand and India, will encourage innovative ways to provide adequately in educating and engaging youth in climate-change issues (Narksompong and Limjirakan, 2015; Dür and Keller, 2018)."

Indigenous Peoples, comprising about 6% of the global population, play a crucial role in the fight against climate change for two interlinked reasons. First, they have a particular physical and spiritual relationship with land, water and associated ecosystems, and tend to be among the most vulnerable group to climate change (Magni, 2017). Second, they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge relevant to finding the best solutions to climate change (Rautela and Karki, 2015). Indigenous knowledge systems and resource management practices are important tools for both mitigating and adapting to climate change (Fernandez-Llamazares et al., 2015). Indigenous knowledge is increasingly recognised as a powerful tool for compiling evidence of climate change over time (Ahmed et al., 2016a). Knowledge of CCA and DRR provide a range of complementary approaches in building resilience and reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems to the impacts of climate change and environmental hazards (Mall et al., 2019). The adaptation dimension involves developing knowledge and utilising existing IKLK, skills and dispositions to better cope with already evident and looming climate impacts (Aghaei et al., 2018). It is also important to ensure inclusive efforts in DRR across different nations and communities as well as increasing skills and capacities of women towards DRR efforts (Alam and Rahman, 2014; Drolet et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2016b; Reyes and Lu, 2016; Hemachandra et al., 2018). More effective and efficient teaching and learning strategies, as well as collaborative networks, are needed to increase preparedness and DRR activities across various levels of community (Oktari et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2015; Tuladhar et al., 2015b; Shiwaku et al., 2016; Gampell et al., 2017)."

Ad-hoc and localised documentations and monitoring of efforts to build adaptive capacities has rendered it difficult to assess success (Cinner et al., 2018). Recommendations for strengthened capacity building are sometimes made or understood in isolation from the underlying structural issues shaping vulnerability, or without adequately recognising the political relationships that mediate the ways in which particular technical interventions result in differentiated outcomes for different groups (Archer and Dodman, 2015). Thus, design- and decision-based tools, such as rapid assessment for community resilience to climate change as well as rapid approach to monitor the effectiveness of aid projects, support the community-based adaptation to climate change to analyse using a multi-dimensional approach, procedural, distributional, rights and responsibilities (Nkoana et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2019)."

Citizen science links communication and engagement in a manner that holds important lessons on ways to promote collective responses to climate (Wals et al., 2014; Bonney et al., 2016). The power of science-based citizen engagement lies in citizen group contribution in drawing upon their local knowledge to enrich the knowledge base required for management decisions (Sayer et al., 2015). Scientific evidence may be less attuned to the complexity of local realities in managing climate change; thus, citizen science has the potential in bridging this gap and has many advantages for climate mitigation and adaptation practice and policy (Ford et al., 2016). While citizen science uses citizens as policy-passive objects for research in conducting measurements for big datasets, citizen social science is gaining momentum where it repositions citizens as central co-learners who can widen the climate-science evidence base to achieve a more holistic understanding for the benefit of all (Kythreotis et al., 2019)."

However, there also exist significant barriers to CRD such as fragmented, reactive governance; inadequate evidence on which actions to prioritise and how to sequence them; and finance deficits. Some Asian countries and regions offer solutions to overcome these barriers: through use of advanced technologies (in situ observation and remote sensing, a variety of new sensor technologies, citizen science, AI and machine learning tools); regional partnerships and learning; improved forecasting capabilities; and better risk awareness (high confidence)."

However, in the 2020 Sustainability Index and Dashboard, only two Asian countries made it into the top 30 countries in the world: Japan (17) and the Republic of Korea (20) (Sachs et al., 2020).

wg2_ch10_10.6.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is growing evidence on the interconnectedness of extreme weather, climate change and disaster impacts (Asia, 2017; Reyer, 2017). In Asia, climate-related disasters have become more recurrent and destructive in terms of both economic and social impacts (Bhatt et al., 2015; Aich et al., 2017; Vij et al., 2017). Projections of increasing frequency, intensity and severity of climate-related disasters call for better integration of CCA and DRR (Sapountzaki, 2018) in policy development to address risks efficiently (Rahman et al., 2018) and to promote sustainable development pathways for reduced vulnerability and increased resilience (Seidler et al., 2018). Connecting CCA and DRR efforts in both policy and practice continue to be a challenge, however, because the convergence of national policy and planning processes on CCA and DRR within Asia is in its early stages (Cousins, 2014) and structural barriers persist (Mall et al., 2019). Both CCA and DRR have developed as separate policy domains because of the different temporal and spatial scales considered, the diversity of actors involved, the policies and institutional frameworks adopted and the differences in tools and methodological approaches used. This has resulted in the CCA and DRR communities, and the knowledge and research they produce to support planning and decision making, not always being well connected (Street et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate risk management in Asia is approached by focusing on hazards that are associated with extremes (i.e., extreme weather events with increased frequency and severity) as well as climate- and weather-related events. For example, farming has been affected by climatic variability and change in a wide variety of ways that include an increase in drought periods and intensity, a shortage of irrigation water availability, an increase in flooding and landslides, pest infestation of crops, a rising number of crop diseases, the introduction of invasive species and crop weeds, land degradation and an overall reduction in crop yields (Khanal et al., 2019). Estimation of the number of daily patients of heat-related illness based on the weather data and newly introduced metrics shows that the effects of age, successive days and heat adaptation are key variables (Kodera et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Because most developing countries in Asia are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to a number of factors, many studies have focused on understanding vulnerability, for instance, gendered vulnerability at the micro scale, which limits capacity to respond to both climatic and socioeconomic stressors (Ferdous and Mallick, 2019); vulnerability of urban poor communities due to the interaction of environmental and social factors (e.g., low incomes, gender, migrant status) and heightens the impacts of climate change on the poor (Porio, 2014); social–ecological vulnerability where a degraded environment influences hazard patterns and vulnerability of people (Depietri, 2020); and livelihood vulnerability due to perceived climate risks and adaptation constraints (Fahad and Wang, 2018; Hossain et al., 2020)."

wg2_ch10_10.6.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Several studies also have identified enabling conditions to effectively implement CCA and DRR actions. In the Arab region of Asia (ARA), the following are critical: capacity building to develop knowledge and awareness; mainstreaming CCA and DRR in the national strategies and policies (e.g., water and environmental strategies); empowering the role of CCA and DRR actors, notably women and rural societies; adopting lessons learned from regions with physical characteristics similar to those of ARA; establishing forecasting and prediction platforms that are supported by advanced monitoring technologies (e.g., remote sensing); and encouraging universities and research centres to develop studies on CCA and DRR. In Southeast Asia, laws and policies, institutional and financial arrangements, risk assessment, capacity building, and planning and implementation are entry points in integrating CCA and DRR (Lassa and Sembiring, 2017; Agency, 2018). According to Cutter et al. (2015), holistic solutions and integrated approaches, rigorous risk research that shows coherent science-based assessment and knowledge transfer from research to practice, and aligned targets on disaster risk management, climate change and sustainable development targets, are critical. Social capital and SP measures could promote pro-poor and gender-responsive adaptation as well as socially inclusive policies (Dilshad et al., 2019; Yari et al., 2019). Community-based approaches could allow local perceptions of climate change and experience of place to be included in planning (Dujardin et al., 2018; Dwirahmadi et al., 2019; Widiati and Irianto, 2019), and multi-stakeholder participation could engage various actors such as the private sector in CCA and DRR. Furthermore, multi-level climate governance could benefit from vertical and horizontal interactions at different levels and layers in the city (Zen et al., 2019). To mainstream and secure funding commitments, CCA and DRR could be integrated into national development plans and sectoral long-term plans (Ishiwatari and Surjan, 2020; Rahayu et al., 2020; Rani et al., 2020 b)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation follows knowledge on risks, and literature exists that systematically identifies and characterises exposure and vulnerability, but gaps still exist. Decision making under uncertainty is challenged by the lack of data for adapting to current and uncertain future climate, the different perceptions of risk, and the potential solutions across different cultures and languages (van der Keur et al., 2016). Lack of downscaled climatic data, diverse institutional structures, and missing links in policies, are among the challenges in South Asia (Mall et al., 2019). In agriculture, there are gaps in the use of advanced farming techniques such as drought-resistant crops, and information on climate change to support farming households in making adaptation decisions (Akhtar et al., 2019; Khanal et al., 2019; Ullah et al., 2019). Better understanding of effective water management is crucial due to conflicts for shared water in ARA (Shaban and Hamze, 2017; UNDP, 2018). For delta regions, gaps identified are methodologies and approaches appropriate for understanding social vulnerability at various scales, pathways required for adaptation policy and response in the deltas that transcend development, and the lessons from implemented policy and how practice can build on these lessons in the deltas, among others (Lwasa, 2015). Approaches in tackling the challenges of climate change and disasters in the cities of developing countries could be better understood, and shared between cities so they can learn from one another (Filho et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Food, energy, water and land are vital elements for sustainable development as well as enhancing resilience to both climatic and non-climatic shocks. All these resources are highly vulnerable to climate change (Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.4). Poor people are most affected due to changes in resources availability and accessibility. Food, water and energy security are interconnected (Bizikova et al., 2013; Ringler et al., 2013; Rasul, 2014; Chang et al., 2016; Ringler et al., 2016). Although adapting to climate change is one of the core components of the global, regional, national and subnational agendas, the focus of adaptation action has remained sectoral. Undermining the interlinkages of food, energy and water security may increase trade-offs between sectors or places, which may lead to maladaptation (Barnett and O’Neill, 2010; Howells et al., 2013; Lele et al., 2013). Therefore, focusing on the nature of trade-offs and synergies across the food–water–energy nexus for integrated management of resources is a potential strategy for adaptation to both climatic and non-climatic challenges (Bhaduri et al., 2015; Zaman et al., 2017). Due to its importance to the Paris Agreement and SDGs, the food–water–energy nexus approach has gotten increasing attention in terms of capturing synergies and minimising trade-offs in this interconnected system, which is also critical for enhancing adaptation together (Bazilian et al., 2011; Lawford et al., 2013; UNESCAP, 2013; FAO, 2014; Rasul and Sharma, 2014; Taniguchi et al., 2017a; Sukhwani et al., 2019; Sukhwani et al., 2020)."

The water–energy nexus includes water for energy and energy for water (Rothausen and Conway, 2011; Hussey and Pittock, 2012; Byers et al., 2014), the water–food nexus includes water for food and the impact of food production on water (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012) and the energy–food nexus includes energy consumption for food production and food crops for biofuel production (Tilman et al., 2009). The food–water–energy–land nexus has diverse implications at the sub-regional level in Asia. The increase in the water-supply gap raises questions about the sustainability of the main mode of electricity generation in South Asia. Thermal power generation and hydropower generation are both threatened by water shortages in South Asia (Luo, 2018b; Mitra et al., 2021). Furthermore, policy-mismatch-driven anthropogenic causes lead to unsustainable water use for food production in India. For example, subsidised electricity supply for watering agriculture plays a key role in losing groundwater’s buffer capacity against the various changes including climate variabilities (Badiani et al., 2012; Mitra, 2017). In the Mekong River basin of Southeast Asia, massive and rapid export-oriented hydropower development will have direct implications on regional food security and livelihoods through a major negative effect on the aquatic ecosystem (Baran and Myschowoda, 2009; Dugan et al., 2010; Arias et al., 2014). Similarly, in Central Asia, the shifting of water storage for irrigation to power development has increased risks on reliable water supply and quality of water (Granit et al., 2012). Deforestation-driven agro-environmental changes have led to a decreased forest water supply, an increased irrigation water demand and a negative effect on cropland stability and productivity (Lim et al., 2017a; Lim et al., 2019b)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Many challenges remain in both scientific research and policy actions at the global, regional, national and subnational levels. The scientific challenges include data, information and knowledge gaps in understanding the food, energy, water and land interlinkages, and lack of systematic tools to address trade-offs (Liu et al., 2017a). Until very recently, implementation of the food–energy–water nexus focused primarily on technical solutions, whereas governance (i.e., the institutions and processes governing the food–energy–water nexus) has not received much consideration (Scheyvens and Shivakoti, 2019). At the policy end, the common challenges for implementation of the water–energy–food–land nexus are absence of sectoral coordination (Pahl-Wostl, 2019), the influence of political priorities on decisions and lack of processes for scientific knowledge to shape decisions, lack of capacity to understand interlinkages between sectors, lack of multi-stakeholder engagement in planning and decision-making processes, and lack of incentive mechanisms and adequate finance to support the approach (Bao et al., 2018; Scheyvens and Shivakoti, 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Social justice focuses on the justice-related implications of social and economic institutions, examined in different ways such as distributional justice (distribution of benefits and burdens across different societal groups), procedural justice (the design of just institutions and processes for decision making), inter-generational justice (duties of justice to future generations) and recognitional justice (recognition of historical inequality) (Thaler et al., 2017). Climate change is affecting every aspect of our society and economy; thus, it is pertinent to understand the interactions between social justice and climate-change impacts (Tol, 2018), in particular, focusing on how vulnerability to various impacts is created, maintained and distributed across geographic, social, demographic and economic dimensions (Bulkeley et al., 2014; Schlosberg and Collins, 2014; Van de Vliert, 2014; Burke et al., 2016). For instance, environmental and health consequences of climate change, which disproportionately affect low-income countries and poor people in high-income countries, profoundly affect human rights and social justice (Levy and Patz, 2015). Furthermore, great concern is expressed about the plight of the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable populations when it comes to climate, but not in other policy domains (Winters, 2014)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Evidence is increasing on the importance of focusing on environmental sustainability, and relieving poverty and social injustice are not conflicting aims; in fact, there is a further need for mainstreaming such approaches in order to respond to the climate-change challenge in a socially just manner (Mayrhofer and Gupta, 2016). These non-conflicting aims are described as co-benefits as reiterated in the IPCC reports as a central concept that refers to ‘the positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, irrespective of the net effect on overall social welfare’ (IPCC, 2014b). Better understanding of how social justice affects, and is affected by, efforts to build adaptive capacity will be crucial to avoiding unintended, and even perverse, outcomes. For example, on the Andaman coast of Thailand, responses to climate-change trends and events tended to be reactive rather than proactive, making already vulnerable people even more vulnerable and undermining their capacity to adapt in the future (Bennett et al., 2014). Different forms of inequality, moreover, render some groups more vulnerable than others to damage from climate hazards. In Mumbai, India, for example, the houses of poorer families required repeated repairs to secure them against flood damage, and the cumulative cost of those repairs consumed a greater proportion of their income than for richer populations (UN, 2016). Building the resilience of vulnerable groups requires strong community and government institutions that can support efforts to cope with devastating events, offering SP and social development initiatives to support at-risk or vulnerable groups (Drolet et al., 2015). In addition, agencies need to consider how they can best work in ways which potentially support longer-term positive change to gender roles and relations. For example, post-disaster activities must build and resource women’s resilience and adaptive capacity in practice and challenge the constraints that impinge on their lives (Sadia et al., 2016; Sohrabizadeh et al., 2016; Hadiyanto et al., 2018; Yumarni and Amaratunga, 2018; Alam and Rahman, 2019)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Insights from the environmental justice literature show that an overemphasis on emission reductions at national levels obscures the negative impacts on disadvantaged communities, including low-income communities (Burch and Harris, 2014). The issue of social justice and adaptation is particularly relevant because of the politics that drive how adaptation and recovery efforts, as well as investments, are targeted towards specific populations, places and capacities (Klinsky et al., 2017). Hence, climate justice and equity need to be highlighted more explicitly in integrative approaches to mitigation and adaptation (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Moellendorf, 2015; Henrique KP, 2020)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The term ‘climate justice’ is used to problematise global warming in ethical and political contexts. It does so by employing the concepts of environmental justice and social justice to examine inequalities and violation of human collective rights in relation to climate-change impacts (Ghimire, 2016)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"At the heart of climate-justice concerns lies the asymmetry that those who have contributed least to the problem of climate change (i.e., GHG emissions) are the ones who will be affected by its adverse impacts the most. It is about sharing the burden and benefits equitably (a) among developed and developing countries in the context of historical responsibility, and (b) within nations to uplift the marginalised and affected populations who have contributed the least to the problem in the contexts of per-capita equity and local vulnerability (Joshi, 2014; Chaudhuri, 2020; Shawoo, 2020)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"An ethical analysis of the climate regime reveals an abidingly strong interconnection between economic circumstances, geopolitical power and the justice claims that nations can assert in negotiations (Okereke, 2016). Events within the climate regime highlight the importance of questioning the extent to which claims of justice can ever be truly realised in the context of international regimes of environmental governance, as well as how much concerns for justice are motivated by other concerns such as relative economic gains or geopolitical objectives (Sikor, 2014)."
wg2_ch10_10.6.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"The global land rush and mainstream climate-change narratives have broadened the ranks of state and social actors concerned about land issues while strengthening those opposed to social-justice-oriented land policies (Borras, 2018). The five deep social reforms (redistribution, recognition, restitution, regeneration and resistance) of socially just land policy are necessarily intertwined. But the global land rush amid deepening climate change calls attention to the linkages, especially between the pursuit of agrarian justice, on the one hand, and climate justice, on the other. Here, the relationship is not without contradictions and warrants increased attention as both unit of analysis and object of political action. Understanding and deepening agrarian-justice imperatives in climate politics, and understanding and deepening climate-justice imperatives in agrarian politics, is needed more than ever in the ongoing pursuit of alternatives. For example, the intersection between land grabs and climate-change mitigation politics in Myanmar has created new political opportunities for scaling up, expanding and deepening the struggles towards ‘agrarian climate justice’(Sekine, 2021)."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate-change-related risks are projected to increase progressively at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming in many parts of Asia. Heat stress and water deficit are affecting human health and food security. Risks due to extreme rainfall and sea level rise are exacerbated in vulnerable Asia. "
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climatologically, the summer surface air temperature in South, Southeast and Southwest Asia is high, and its coastal area is very humid. In these regions, heat stress is already a medium risk for humans. Large cities are warmer by more than 2°C compared with the surroundings due to heat island effects, exacerbating heat stress conditions. Future warming will cause more frequent temperature extremes and heatwaves especially in densely populated South Asian cities, where working conditions will be exacerbated and daytime outdoor work will become dangerous. For example, incidence of excess heat-related mortality in 51 cities in China is estimated to reach 37,800 deaths per year over a 20-year period in the mid-21st century (2041–2060) under the RCP8.5 scenario."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Asian glaciers are the water resources for local and adjacent regions. Glaciers are decreasing in Central, Southwest, Southeast and North Asia, but are stable or increased in some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region. The glacier melt water in the southern Tibetan Plateau increased during 1998–2007, and the total amount and area of glacier lakes has increased during recent decades. In the future, maximum glacial runoff is projected in High Mountain Asia. Glacier collapses and surges, together with glacier lake outburst flood due to the expansion of glacier lakes, will threaten the securities of the local and down streaming societies."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"With much of the Asian population living in drought-prone areas, water scarcity is a prevailing risk across Asia through water and food shortage leading to malnutrition. Populations vulnerable to impacts related to water are going to increase progressively at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming. Aggravating drought condition is projected in Central Asia. Water quality degradation also has profound impact on human health."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Extreme rainfall causes floods in vulnerable rivers. Observed changes in extreme rainfall vary considerably by region in Asia. Extreme rainfall events (such as heavy rainfall >100 mm per day) have been increasing in South and East Asia. In the future, most of East and Southeast Asia are projected to experience more intense rainfall events as soon as by the middle of the 21st century. In those regions, the flood risk will become more frequent and severe. It is estimated that over one-third of Asian cities and about 932 million urban dwellers are living in areas with high risk of flooding."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Sea level rise is continuing. Higher than the global mean sea level rise is projected on Asian coasts. Storm surge and high wave by tropical cyclones of higher intensity are high risk for a large number of Asian megacities facing the ocean: China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam have the highest numbers of coastal populations exposed and thus are most vulnerable to disaster-related mortality."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Changes in terrestrial biome have been observed that are consistent with warming, such as an upward move of treeline position in mountains. Climate change, human activity, lightning and quality of forest governance and management have increased wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia in recent decades. Changes in marine primary production also have been observed: a decrease up to 20% over the past six decades in the western Indian Ocean, due to ocean warming and stratification, has restricted nutrient mixing. The risk of irreversible loss of many ecosystems will increase with global warming."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.1_p8,NO_TITLE,The likelihood of adverse impacts to agricultural and food security in many parts of developing Asia will progressively escalate with the changing climate. The potential of total fisheries production in South and Southeast Asia is also projected to decrease.
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Asia exhibits tremendous variation in terms of ecosystems, economic development, cultures and climate risk exposure. Mirroring this variation, households, communities and governments have a wide range of coping and adaptation strategies to deal with changing climatic conditions, with co-benefits for various non-climatic issues such as poverty, conflict and livelihood dynamics."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Currently, Asian countries have rich evidence on managing risk, drawing on long histories of dealing with change. For example, to deal with erratic rainfall and shifting monsoons, farmers make incremental shifts such as changing what and when they grow or adjusting their irrigation practices. Communities living in coastal settlements are using Early warning systems to prepare for cyclones or raising the height of their houses to minimise flood impacts. These types of strategies, seen across all Asian sub-regions, based on local social and ecological contexts, are termed autonomous adaptations that occur incrementally and help people manage current impacts."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Currently and in the future, Asia is identified as one of regions most vulnerable to climate change, especially on extreme heat, flooding, sea level rise and erratic rainfall. All these climatic risks, when overlaid on existing development deficits, show us that incremental adaptation will not be enough; transformational change is required. Recognising this, at subnational and national levels, government and non-governmental actors are also prioritising planned adaptation strategies which include interventions like ‘climate-smart agriculture’ as seen in South and Southeast Asian countries, or changing labour laws to reduce exposure to heat as seen in West Asia. These are often sectoral priorities governments lay out through national or subnational policies and projects, drawing on various sources of funding: domestic, bilateral and international. Apart from these planned adaptation strategies in social systems, Asian countries also report and invest in adaptation measures in natural systems such as expanding nature reserves to enable species conservation or setting up habitat corridors to facilitate landscape connectivity and species movements across climatic gradients."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Overall, the fundamental challenges that Asia will see exacerbated under climate change are around water and food insecurity, poverty and inequality, and increased frequency and severity of extreme events. In some places and for some people, climate change, even at 1.5°C and more so at 2°C, will significantly constrain the functioning and well-being of human and ecological systems. Asian cities, villages and countries are rising to this current and projected challenge, albeit somewhat unevenly."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Some examples of innovative adaptation actions are China’s ‘Sponge Cities’ which are trying to protect ecosystems while reducing risk for people, now and in the future. Another example is India’s Heat Action Plans that are using ‘cool roofs’ technologies and awareness-building campaigns to reduce the impacts of extreme heat. Across South and Southeast Asia, climate-smart agriculture programmes are reducing GHG emissions associated with farming while helping farmers adapt to changing risks. Each country is experimenting with infrastructural, nature-based, technological, institutional and behavioural strategies to adapt to current and future climate change with local contexts shaping both the possibility of undertaking such actions as well as the effectiveness of these actions to reduce risk. What works for ageing cities in Japan exposed to heatwaves and floods may not work for pastoral communities in the highlands of Central Asia, but there is progress on understanding what actions work and for whom. The challenge is to scale current adaptation action, especially in the most exposed areas and for the most vulnerable populations, as well as move beyond adapting to single risks alone (i.e., adapt to multiple coinciding risks such as flooding and water scarcity in coastal cities across South Asia or extreme heat and flash floods in West Asia). In this context, funding and implementing adaptation is essential, and while Asian countries are experimenting with a range of autonomous and planned adaptation actions to deal with these multiple and often concurrent challenges, making current development pathways climate resilient is necessary and, some might argue, unavoidable."

wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Key findings across Asia underline the importance of building, sustaining and augmenting local capacity through addressing inadequacies in terms of resource base, climate-change awareness, government–community partnerships and vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, inclusion of as well as related practices will improve adaptation planning and decision-making processes concerning climate change."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"In climate-sensitive livelihoods, an integrated approach informed by science that examines multiple stressors, along with IKLK, appears to be of immense value. For instance, in building farmers’ resilience, enhancing CCA, ensuring cross-cultural communication and promoting local skills, Indigenous People’s intuitive thinking processes and geographic knowledge of remote areas are very important."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"There is also a widespread recognition that IKLK are important in ensuring successful ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). However, this recognition requires more practical application and translation into IKLK-driven EbA projects. For instance, in the Coral Triangle region, creating historical timelines and mapping seasonal calendars can help to capture IKLK while also feeding this information into climate science and climate adaptation planning. Identifying indigenous crop species for agriculture by using IKLK is already identified as an important way to localise climate adaptation: an example is Bali’s vital contribution of moral economies to food systems which have long built resilience among groups of communities in terms of food security and sovereignty, even with the challenges faced due to modernising of local food systems."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Many of the pressing problems of Asia, including water scarcity, rapid urbanisation, deforestation, loss of species, rising coastal hazards and agricultural loss can be effectively negated, or at least minimised, through proper adoption of suitable science and technological methods. Climate-change adaptation is greatly facilitated by science, technology and innovation. This ranges from application of existing science, new development on scientific tools and methods, application of IKLK and citizen sciences. Deploying Knowledge Quality Assessment Tool found significant co-relation between science-based and IKLK framing would help to address, acknowledge and utilise by an integrated approach the wisdom of IKLK, a valuable asset for climate adaptation governance. The IKLK-based environmental indicators need to be seen as part of a separate system of knowledge that coexists with, but is not submerged into, another conventional knowledge system."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"In the context of education and capacity development of climate change, an integrated approach of embracing both the importance of climate science and IKLK is acknowledged. The IKLK is increasingly recognised as a powerful tool for compiling evidence of climate change over time. Such as knowledge of CCA and DRR provide a range of complementary approaches in building resilience and reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems. Developing knowledge and utilising existing IKLK, skills and dispositions to better cope with already evident and looming climate impacts. Engaging communities in the process of documenting and understanding long-term trends and practices will enable both IKLK as well as Western scientific assessments of climate change to contribute in designing appropriate climate adaptation measures."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"In order to achieve the multiple goals of CCA, mitigation and sustainable development, critical are rapid, system transitions across (a) energy systems, (b) land and ecosystems and (c) urban and infrastructural systems. This is especially important across Asia, which has the largest population exposed to current climate risks and high sub-regional diversity, and where risks are expected to rise significantly and unevenly under higher levels of global warming. However, such transformational change is deeply challenging because of variable national development imperatives; differing capacities and requirements of large, highly unequal and vulnerable populations; and socioeconomic and ecological diversity that requires very contextual solutions. Furthermore, issues such as growing transboundary risks, inadequate data for long-term adaptation planning, finance barriers, uneven institutional capacity and non-climatic issues, such as increasing conflict, political instability and polarization, constrain rapid, transformational action across systems."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Despite these challenges, there are increasing examples of actions across Asia that are meeting climate adaptation goals and SDGs simultaneously, such as through climate-smart agriculture, disaster risk management and NbS. To enable these system transitions, vertical and horizontal policy linkages, active communication and cooperation between multiple stakeholders, and attention to the root causes of vulnerability are essential. Furthermore, rapid systemic transformation can be enabled by policies and finances to incentivise capacity building, new technological innovation and diffusion. The effectiveness of such technology-centred approaches can be maximised by combining them with attention to behavioural shifts such as by improving education and awareness, building local capacities and institutions, and leveraging IKLK."
wg2_ch10_FAQ 10.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Obviously, time is of the essence. If system transitions are delayed, there is high confidence that climatic risks will increase human and natural system vulnerability, as well as increase inequality and erode the achievements of multiple SDGs. Thus, urgent systemic change that is suited to national and subnational social–ecological contexts across Asia is imperative."
