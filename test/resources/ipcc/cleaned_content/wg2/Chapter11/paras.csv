It should be read in conjunction with other Working Group (WG) II chapters, the climate science assessment in the WGI report and the greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation assessment in the WGIII report."
wg2_ch11_11.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Australasia region is defined as the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and territories of Australia and New Zealand. In both countries, climate adaptation is largely implemented at a sub-national level through the devolution of functions constitutionally or by statute, alongside disaster risk reduction (COAG, 2011; Lawrence et al., 2015; Macintosh et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch11_11.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Australia’s economy is dominated by financial and insurance services, education, mining, construction, tourism, health care and social assistance (ABS, 2018) with Australian exports accruing mostly from mining (ABS, 2018; ABS, 2019). In New Zealand, service industries, including tourism, collectively account for around two-thirds of GDP (NZ Treasury, 2016). The primary sector contributes 6% of New Zealand’s GDP and over half of the country’s export earnings (NZ Treasury, 2016)."
wg2_ch11_11.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Existing vulnerabilities expose and exacerbate inequalities between rural, regional and urban areas, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples, those with health and disability needs, and between generations, incomes and health status, increasing the relative climate change risk faced by some groups and places (high confidence) (Jones et al., 2014; Bertram, 2015; Perry, 2017; Hazledine and Rashbrooke, 2018)."
wg2_ch11_11.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Previous IPCC reports (Table 11.1) have documented observed climate impacts, projected risks, adaptation challenges and opportunities. This chapter presents more evidence of observed climate impacts and adaptation, better quantification of socioeconomic risks, new information about cascading and compounding risks, greater emphasis on adaptation enablers and barriers, and links to climate resilient development."

Frame et al., 2018; Plummer et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2018; Gartin et al., 2020). In the absence of proactive adaptation, climate change impacts are projected to worsen inequalities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups (Green et al., 2009; Manning et al., 2014; Ambrey et al., 2017) (high confidence). Socioeconomic inequality, low incomes and high levels of debt, poor health and disabilities increase vulnerability and limit adaptation (Hayward, 2012) (11.7.2). A lack of services, such as schools and medical services, in poorer and rural areas and decision-making processes that privilege some voices over others exacerbate inequalities (Kearns et al., 2009; Hinkson and Vincent, 2018)."
wg2_ch11_11.1.2 _p2,NO_TITLE,"Changes to the composition and location of different demographic groups in the region contribute to increased exposure or vulnerability to climate change (medium confidence). Australia’s population reached 25 million in 2018 and is projected to grow to 37.4–49.2 million by 2066, with most growth in major cities (accounting for 81% of Australia’s population growth from 2016 to 2017) (ABS, 2018), although COVID-19 is expected to slow the growth rate (CoA, 2020c). The highest growth rates outside of major cities occurred mostly in coastal regions (ABS, 2017), which have built assets exposed to sea level rise (SLR). New Zealand’s population was 5.1 million at the end of 2020 and is projected to increase to 6.0–6.5 million by 2068, assuming no marked changes in migration patterns (Stats NZ, 2016; Stats NZ, 2021). Although the population densities of both countries are much lower than other OECD countries, they are highly urbanised with over 86% living in urban areas in both countries (Productivity Commission, 2017; World Bank, 2018). This proportion is projected to increase to over 90% by 2050 (UN DESA, 2019) mostly in coastal areas (Rouse et al., 2017). Consideration of climate change impacts when planning and managing such growth and associated infrastructure could help avoid new vulnerabilities being created, particularly from wildfires, sea level rise (SLR), heat stress and flooding."

wg2_ch11_11.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Regional climate change has continued since AR5 was released in 2014, with trends exacerbating many extreme events (very high confidence). The following changes are quantified with references in Tables 11.2a and 11.2b. The region has continued to warm (Figure 11.1), with more extremely high temperatures and fewer extremely low temperatures. Snow depths and glacier volumes have declined. Sea level rise and ocean acidification have continued. Northern Australia has become wetter, while April–October rainfall has decreased in south-western and south-eastern Australia. In New Zealand, most of the south has become wetter, while most of the north has become drier (Figure 11.2). The frequency, severity and duration of extreme fire weather conditions have increased in southern and eastern Australia and eastern New Zealand. Changes in extreme rainfall are mixed. There has been a decline in tropical cyclone frequency near Australia."
wg2_ch11_11.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Reliable measurements are limited for some types of storms, particularly thunderstorms, lightning, tornadoes and hail (Walsh et al., 2016). Many high-impact events are a combination of interacting physical processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g., fires, heatwaves and droughts), and better understanding of these extreme and compound events is needed (Zscheischler et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch11_11.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Some of the observed trends and events can be partly attributed to anthropogenic climate change, as documented in Chapter 16. Examples include regional warming trends and sea level rise (SLR), terrestrial and marine heatwaves, declining rainfall and increasing fire weather in southern Australia and extreme rainfall and severe droughts in New Zealand."
wg2_ch11_11.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"There are three main sources of uncertainty in climate projections: emission scenarios, regional climate responses and internal climate variability (CSIRO and BOM, 2015). Emission scenario uncertainty is captured in Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for greenhouse gases and aerosols. RCP2.6 represents low emissions, RCP4.5 medium emissions and RCP8.5 high emissions. Regional climate response uncertainty and internal climate variability uncertainty are captured in climate model simulations driven by the RCPs."
wg2_ch11_11.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Further climate change is inevitable, with the rate and magnitude largely dependent on the emission pathway (very high confidence) (IPCC, 2021). Preliminary projections based on Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are described in the IPCC Working Group I Atlas. For Australia, the CMIP6 projections broadly agree with CMIP5 projections except for a group of CMIP6 models with greater warming and a narrower range of summer rainfall change in the north and winter rainfall change in the south (Grose et al., 2020). For New Zealand, the CMIP6 projections are similar to CMIP5, but the CMIP6 models indicate greater warming, a smaller increase in summer precipitation and a larger increase in winter precipitation (Gutiérrez et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch11_11.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Dynamical and statistical downscaling offer the prospect of improved representation of regional climate features and extreme weather events (IPCC 2021: Working Group I Chapter 10 (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021)), but the added value of downscaling is complex to evaluate (Ekström et al., 2015; Rummukainen, 2015; Virgilio et al., 2021). Downscaled simulations are available for New Zealand (MfE, 2018) and various Australian regions (Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Further downscaling was recommended by the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements (CoA, 2020e). Projections for rainfall, thunderstorms, hail, lightning and tornadoes have large uncertainties (Walsh et al., 2016; MfE, 2018)."
wg2_ch11_11.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Future changes in climate variability are affected by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). An increase in strong El Niño and La Niña events is projected (Cai, 2015), along with more extreme positive phases of the IOD (Cai et al., 2018) and a positive trend in SAM (Lim et al., 2016), but potential changes in the IPO are unknown (NESP ESCC, 2020). There is uncertainty about regional climate responses to projected changes in ENSO (King et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2020; Virgilio et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch11_11.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Australian climate projections are quantified with references in Table 11.3a. Further warming is projected, with more hot days, fewer cold days, reduced snow cover, ongoing sea level rise (SLR) and ocean acidification (very high confidence). Winter and spring rainfall and soil moisture are projected to decrease, with higher evaporation rates, decreased wind over southern mainland Australia, increased wind over Tasmania, and more extreme fire weather in southern and eastern Australia (high confidence). Heavy rainfall intensity is projected to increase, with more droughts over southern and eastern Australia (medium confidence). Increased winter rainfall is projected over Tasmania, with decreased rainfall in southwestern Victoria in autumn and in western Tasmania in summer, fewer tropical cyclones with a greater proportion of severe cyclones and decreased soil moisture in the north (medium confidence).

wg2_ch11_11.3.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Widespread and severe impacts on ecosystems and species are now evident across the region (very high confidence) (Table 11.4). Climate impacts reflect both ongoing change and discrete extreme weather events (Harris et al., 2018), and the climatic change signal is emerging despite confounding influences (Hoffmann et al., 2019). Fundamental shifts are observed in the structure and composition of some ecosystems and associated services (Table 11.4). Impacts documented for species include global and local extinctions, severe regional population declines and phenotypic responses (Table 11.4). In terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, land use impacts are interacting with climate, resulting in significant changes to ecosystem structure, composition and function (Bergstrom et al., 2021), with some landscapes experiencing catastrophic impacts (Table 11.4). Some of the observed changes may be irreversible where projected impacts on ecosystems and species persist (Table 11.5). Of note is the global extinction of an endemic mammal species, the Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), from the loss of habitat attributable in part to sea level rise (SLR) and storm surges in the Torres Strait (Table 11.4)."
wg2_ch11_11.3.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Natural forest and woodland ecosystem processes are experiencing differing impacts and responses depending on the climate zone (high confidence). In Australia, an overall increase in the forest fire danger index, associated with warming and drying trends (Table 11.2a), has been observed particularly for southern and eastern Australia in recent decades (Box 11.1). The 2019–2020 mega wildfires of south eastern Australia burnt between 5.8 and 8.1 million hectares of mainly temperate broadleaf forest and woodland, but with substantial areas of rainforest also impacted, and were unprecedented in their geographic location, spatial extent and forest types burnt (Boer et al., 2020; Nolan et al., 2020; Abram et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2021; Godfree et al., 2021). The human influence on these events is evident (Abram et al., 2021; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021) (Box 11.1). The fires had significant consequences for wildlife (Hyman et al., 2020; Nolan et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2020) (Box 11.1) and flow-on impacts for aquatic fauna (Silva et al., 2020). In southern Australia, deeply rooted native tree species can access soil and groundwater resources during drought, providing a level of natural resilience (Bell and Nikolaus Callow, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). However, the Northern Jarrah forests of south western Australia have experienced tree mortality and dieback from long-term precipitation decline and acute heatwave-compounded drought (Wardell-Johnson et al., 2015; Matusick et al., 2018). While there is limited information on observed impacts for New Zealand, increased mast seeding events in beech forest ecosystems that stimulate invasive population irruptions have been recorded (Schauber et al., 2002; Tompkins et al., 2013)."

Climate change will interact with current ecological conditions, threats and pressures, with cascading ecological impacts, including population declines, heat-related mortalities, extinctions and disruptions for many species and ecosystems (high confidence) (Table 11.5). These include inadequate allocation of environmental flows for freshwater fish (Vertessy et al., 2019), native forest logging for old-growth-forest-dependent fauna (Lindenmayer et al., 2015; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020a; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020b), and invasive species (Scott et al., 2018). Climate change has synergistic and compounding impacts, particularly in bioregions already experiencing ecosystem degradation, threatened endemics and collapse of keystone species, including those of value to Indigenous Peoples, and high extinction rates as a consequence of human activities (Table 11.4) (Gordon, 2009; Australia SoE, 2016; Weeks et al., 2016; Cresswell and Murphy, 2017; Hare et al., 2019; MfE, 2019; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020a; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020b; Bergstrom et al., 2021). Some native species are projected to have potentially greater geographic range if they can colonise new areas, while other species may be resilient to projected climate change impacts (Bulgarella et al., 2014; K.E. Lawrence et al., 2017; Conroy et al., 2019; Rizvanovic et al., 2019)."

wg2_ch11_11.3.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"In southern Australia, some forest ecosystems (alpine ash, snow gum woodland, pencil pine, northern jarrah) are projected to transition to a new state or collapse due to hotter and drier conditions with more fires (high confidence) (Table 11.5). In Australia, most native eucalyptus forest plants have a range of traits that enable them to persist with recurrent fire through recovery buds (sprouters) or regenerate through seeding (Collins, 2020), affording them a high level of resilience. For high-end projected 2060–2080 fire weather conditions in southeast Australia (Clarke and Evans, 2019), stand-killing wildfires could occur at a severity and frequency greater than the regenerative capacity of seeders (Enright et al., 2015; Clarke and Evans, 2019). Most New Zealand native plants are not fire resistant and are projected to be replaced by fire-resistant introduced species following climate-change-related fires (Perry et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch11_11.3.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"A loss of alpine biodiversity in the southeast Australian Alps bioregion is projected in the near-term as a result of less snow on snow patch feldmark and short alpine herb fields as well as increased stress on snow-dependent plant and animal species (high confidence) (Table 11.3, Table 11.5). In Australia, invasive plants’ and weeds’ response rates are expected to be faster than for native species, and climate change could foster the appearance of a new set of weed species, with many bioregions facing increased impacts from non-native plants (medium confidence) (Gallagher et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2014; March-Salas and Pertierra, 2020) (Table 11.5), along with declines in some listed weeds (Duursma et al., 2013; Gallagher et al., 2013). In New Zealand, climate change is projected to enable invasive species to expand to higher elevations and southwards (medium confidence) (Table 11.5) (Giejsztowt et al., 2020; MfE, 2020a)."
wg2_ch11_11.3.1.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Projected responses of ecosystem processes are uncertain in part due to complex interactions of climate change with soil respiration, plant nutrient availability (Hasegawa et al., 2015; Orwin et al., 2015; Ochoa-Hueso et al., 2017) and changing fire regimes (Table 11.5) (Scheiter et al., 2015; Dowdy et al., 2019). For aquatic biota, responses will reflect seasonal differences in water temperature (Wallace et al., 2015) and changes in rainfall intensity, productivity and biodiversity (Jardine et al., 2015). Extreme floods may have negative impacts on New Zealand river biota, by mobilising nutrients, sediments and toxic chemicals and aiding the dispersal of invasive species. These effects are compounded by homogenisation of rivers through channelisation (Death et al., 2015)."

Low-lying coastal wetlands are susceptible to saltwater intrusion from sea level rise (SLR) (Shoo et al., 2014; Kettles and Bell, 2015; Finlayson et al., 2017) with consequences for species dependent on freshwater habitats (Houston et al., 2020). Saline habitat conditions will move inland and new coastal ecosystem states may emerge, including the World Heritage listed Kakadu’s freshwater wetland (Bayliss et al., 2018) (Table 11.5). Increasingly, sea level rise (SLR) will shrink the intertidal zone, having implications for wading birds which use this zone (Tait and Pearce, 2019) (Box 11.6). The ecology of freshwater wetlands in New Zealand are projected to be impacted by the intersection of warming, drought and heavy rainfall (Pingram et al., 2021) (Table 11.5)."
wg2_ch11_11.3.1.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"The impacts on species from projected global warming depend on their physiological and ecological responses for which knowledge is limited (Table 11.5) (Bulgarella et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2018; Green et al., 2021). Knowledge of projected impacts is constrained by uncertainties about the influence of physiological limits, barriers to dispersal, competition, the availability of habitat resources (Worth et al., 2014) and disruptions to ecological interactions (Lakeman-Fraser and Ewers, 2013; Parida et al., 2015; Porfirio et al., 2016). Gaps in ecological modelling of future climate impacts include consideration of long-term rainfall and temperature changes (Grimm-Seyfarth et al., 2017; Grimm-Seyfarth et al., 2018), species dispersal rates, evolutionary capacity and phenotypic plasticity and the thresholds at which they are considered adequate to counter the impacts of climate change (Ofori et al., 2017b), as well as indirect effects including sea level rise (SLR) and altered fire regimes (Shoo et al., 2014; Cadenhead et al., 2016; He et al., 2016)."

Effective strategies promote ecosystem resilience by changing unsustainable land uses and management practices, increasing habitat connectivity, controlling introduced species, restoring habitats, implementing appropriate fire management, integrated risk assessment and adaptation planning (B. Frame et al., 2018; Lindenmayer et al., 2020; Macinnis-Ng et al., 2021). Complementary approaches include ex situ seed banks (Morrison and Pickering, 2013; Christie et al., 2020)."

Best planning practice includes keeping options open (Barnett et al., 2015; Dunlop et al., 2016; Finlayson et al., 2017) and updating management plans in light of new information. New insights are emerging into how species’ natural adaptive capacities can inform adaptation planning (Llewelyn et al., 2016; Steane et al., 2017; Hoeppner and Hughes, 2019). Physiological limits to adaptation in some species are being identified (Barnett et al., 2015; Sorensen et al., 2016), and where natural responses are not feasible, human-assisted translocations may be warranted (Becker et al., 2013; Chauvenet et al., 2013; Innes et al., 2019) for some species (Ofori et al., 2017a; Ofori et al., 2017b).

For New Zealand, understanding how terrestrial ecosystems and species respond to climate change is a priority, and where existing stressors are affecting freshwater quantity and quality, in situ monitoring to detect and evaluate projections of climate change impacts on biodiversity and a national data repository are lacking (MfE, 2020a). The projected increase in invasive species indicates the importance of a step-up in pest management efforts to ensure native species persistence as invasive species spread from climate change (Firn et al., 2015).

Although Australia’s eucalyptus forests and woodlands are fire adapted (Collins, 2020), increasing intensity and frequency of fires may exceed their resilience because of the shorter intervals between high-severity fires (Bowman et al., 2014; Etchells et al., 2020; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020a).

Bleaching conditions are projected to occur twice each decade from 2035, annually after 2044 under RCP8.5 and annually after 2051 under RCP4.5 (Heron et al., 2017).

The Australian government is investing AUD$1.9 billion to support the GBR through science and practical environmental outcomes, including reducing other anthropogenic pressures, which can suppress natural adaptive capacity (CoA, 2019b; GBRMPA, 2019). However, adaptation efforts on the GBR aimed specifically at climate impacts, for example coral restoration following marine heatwave impacts (Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020), may slow the impacts of climate change in small discrete regions of the reef or reduce short-term socioeconomic ramifications, but they will not prevent widespread bleaching (Condie et al. 2021)."

Drier winters have increased the irrigation requirement for wine grapes (Bonada et al., 2020), while smoke from the 2019/20 fires, which occurred early in the season, caused significant taint damage (Jiang et al., 2021).

When CO2 was elevated from present-day levels of 400 to 550 ppm in trials, yields of rainfed wheat, field pea and lentil increased approximately 25% (0–70%). However, there was a 6% reduction in wheat protein that could not be offset by additional nitrogen fertilizer (O’Leary et al., 2015; Fitzgerald et al., 2016; Tausz et al., 2017). Elevated CO2 will worsen some pest and disease pressures, for example, barley yellow dwarf virus impacts on wheat (Trębicki et al., 2015). Warmer temperatures are also expanding the potential range of the Queensland fruit fly, including into New Zealand (Aguilar et al., 2015a), threatening the horticulture industry (Sultana et al., 2017; Sultana et al., 2020). Some crop pests (e.g., the oat aphid) are projected to be negatively affected by climate change (Macfadyen et al., 2018), but so too are beneficial insects. There is large uncertainty in rainfall and crop projections for northern Australia (Table 11.3). For sugarcane, an impact assessment for CO2 at 734 ppm using the A2 emission scenario at Ayr in Queensland projected modest yield increases (Singels et al., 2014).

A narrowing of grain-growing regions is projected with a shift of the inner margin towards the coast under drier and warmer conditions (Nidumolu et al., 2012; Fletcher et al., 2020). The economic impact of the shift depends on adaptation (Sanderson et al., 2015; Hunt et al., 2019) and how resources, support industries, infrastructure and settlements adapt. Shifts in agro-ecological zones present some opportunities, for example warming is projected to be beneficial for wine production in Tasmania (Harris et al., 2020)."

Observed adaptations include new technologies that improve resource efficiencies, professional knowledge and skills development, new farmer and community networks and diversification of business and household income (Ghahramani et al., 2015; De et al., 2016). For Australian wheat, earlier sowing and longer-season cultivars may increase yield by 2–4% by 2050, with a range of −7 to +2% by 2090 (Wang et al., 2018a). In the wheat industry, breeding for improved reproductive frost tolerance remains a priority (Lobell et al., 2015). Modelling suggests that, since 1990, farm management has held Australian wheat yields constant, but declining rainfall and increasing temperature may have contributed to a 27% decline in simulated potential Australian wheat yield (Hochman et al., 2017)."

Droughts are causing economic damage to livestock enterprises, with drought and market prices significantly affecting profit (Hughes et al., 2019a), in addition to the impacts on animal health and the livelihoods of pastoralists, periods of drought contribute to land degradation, particularly in the cattle regions of northern Australia (Marshall, 2015). Heat load in cattle leads to reduced growth rates and reproduction, and extreme heat waves can lead to death (Lees et al., 2019; Harrington, 2020).

In eastern parts of Queensland, climate change impacts on pasture growth are equivocal, with simple empirical models suggesting a decrease in net primary productivity (Liu et al., 2017), while mechanistic models that include increases in length of the growing season and the beneficial effects of CO2 fertilisation indicate increases in pasture growth (Cobon et al., 2020).

Tensions also exist between climate change adaptation and mitigation goals (e.g., current energy efficiency standards in Australian buildings can worsen their heat resistance and increase dependence on air-conditioning) (Hatvani-Kovacs et al., 2018). Where there is a lack of coordination between jurisdictions, there can be flow-on effects from failure to adapt, for example in coastal local government areas (Dedekorkut-Howes et al., 2020) (Box 11.6). There is limited information across the region on climate change impacts and adaptation options for telecommunications (NCCARF, 2013) (Table 11.7). There is an emerging recognition that implementing and evaluating the adaptation process (vulnerability and risk assessments, identification of options, planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review) in local contexts can advance more effective adaptation (Moloney and McClaren, 2018). For example, the Victorian state government has built monitoring, evaluation and adaptation components into its adaptation plan (Table 11.15a)."

Water is highly valued by Māori for its mauri or life force and for its intrinsic values and multiple uses (Harmsworth et al., 2016). Increasingly, these diverse values are coming into conflict (Hopkins et al., 2015) due to increasing pressures from how land is used and managed and the effects on water availability and quality. Such tensions will be further challenged as temperatures rise and extreme events intensify beyond what has been experienced, thus stressing current adaptive capacities (high confidence) (Hughey and Becken, 2014; Cradock-Henry and McKusker, 2015; Hopkins et al., 2015; MfE and Stats NZ, 2021 ) (11.2.2; 11.3.4)."

Pressure for long-term access to groundwater or large-scale water storage is increasing to ensure the ongoing viability of the primary sector as the climate changes. While investment in irrigation infrastructure may reduce climate change impacts in the short term, maladaptive outcomes cannot be ruled out longer term, which means that focusing attention now on adaptive and transformational measures can help increase climate resilience in areas exposed to increasing drought and climate extremes that disrupt production (medium confidence) (Abel et al., 2016; Cradock-Henry et al., 2019) (Yletyinen et al., 2019)."

Public concern has increased over the deterioration of New Zealand’s waterways and the profiting of some land uses at the expense of environmental quality and human health—tensions that make adaptation to climate change more challenging (Duncan, 2014; Foote et al., 2015; Scarsbrook and Melland, 2015; McDowell et al., 2016; McKergow et al., 2016; Greenhalgh and Samarasinghe, 2018). A lack of precautionary governance of water resources linked to unsustainable land use practices degrading water quality (Scarsbrook and Melland, 2015; Salmon, 2019) highlights the role that foresight could play in managing the nexus between land, water and people in a changing climate (11.3.3).

Extreme heat leads to excess deaths and increased rates of many illnesses (Hales et al., 2000; Nitschke et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2020). Between 1991 and 2011 it is estimated that 35–36% of heat-related mortality in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne was attributable to climate change, amounting to about 106 deaths a year on average over the study period (Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). Exposure to high temperatures at work is common in Australia, and the health consequences may include more accidents, acute heat stroke and chronic disease (Kjellstrom et al., 2016). Long-term rise in temperatures is changing the balance of summer and winter mortality in Australia (Hanigan et al., 2021). The Black Summer wildfires in Australia in 2019/2020 (Box 11.1) caused 33 deaths directly (Davey and Sarre, 2020) and exposed millions of people to heavy particulate pollution (Vardoulakis et al., 2020). In the Australian states most heavily affected by the fires, 417 deaths, 3151 hospital admissions for cardiovascular or respiratory conditions and about 1300 emergency department presentations for asthma are attributed to wildfire smoke exposure (Borchers Arriagada et al., 2020).

However, tourists may substitute destinations or ski less in the absence of snow (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Cocolas et al., 2015; Walters and Ruhanen, 2015)."

However, there is no trend in normalised losses because the rising insurance costs are being driven by more people living in vulnerable locations with more to lose (McAneney et al., 2019). In New Zealand, two major hailstorms during 2014–2020 and three major floods during 2019–2021 caused significant insurance losses (ICNZ, 2021). Insured losses exceeded NZD$472 million for the 12 costliest floods from 2007 to 2017, of which NZD$140 million could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Frame et al., 2020). In Australia, insured damage was almost AUD$1.0 billion for the Queensland hailstorm in 2020, AUD$1.7 billion for east coast flooding in 2020, AUD$2.3 billion for the 2019–2020 fires, AUD$2.3 billion for the Queensland hailstorm in 2019, AUD$1.2 billion for the North Queensland floods in 2019, AUD$1.4 billion for the NSW hailstorm in 2018, AUD$1.8 billion for Cyclone Debbie in 2017 and AUD$1.5 billion for the Brisbane hailstorm in 2014 (ICA, 2020b).

Underinsurance reduces people’s capacity to recover from adverse events, while over-reliance on private insurance undermines collective disaster recovery efforts (Lucas and Booth, 2020). In Australia, those in high-risk areas minimise house and contents insurance for financial reasons (Booth and Harwood, 2016; Osbaldison et al., 2019; Actuaries Institute, 2020).

For example, the agricultural banking sector has analysed climate risk and embedded climate adaptation financing into its risk scoring and lending practices (CBA, 2019).

Some insurers offer premium discounts to customers with reduced risk (Drill et al., 2016), with increasing premiums reflecting known risk and no cover for some hazards in risky locations (CCATWG, 2017). Special excess payments are available for flood hazard so customers take responsibility for part of the claim, with increasing premiums to reflect known and foreseeable risk and downgrading cover from replacement value to market value (Bruyère et al., 2020). Retreat by private insurers from risky locations could increase the unfunded fiscal risk to the government (Storey and Noy, 2017), creating moral hazard (Boston and Lawrence, 2018). The litigation risk from failing to take adaptation action (Hodder, 2019) could affect financial markets and government policy settings, creating cascading impacts across society (Lawrence et al., 2020b) CRO Forum, 2019).

Fires (including those sparked by electrical distribution lines) pose risks to assets. Smoke can cause electricity transmission to trip, and high winds reduce wind-energy capacity and threaten the integrity of transmission lines. Low rainfall reduces hydro-energy capacity and increases the demand for desalination energy. Higher sea level may affect some low-lying generation, distribution and transmission assets, and compound extreme weather events can cause outages (Vose and Applequist, 2014; Lawrence et al., 2016; AEMO, 2020b; AEMO, 2020a; ESCI, 2021).

Large proportions of collectively owned land already suffer from high rates of erosion (Warmenhoven et al., 2014; Awatere et al., 2018), which are projected to be exacerbated by climate-change-induced extreme rainfalls (high confidence) (RSNZ, 2016; Awatere et al., 2018). Changing drought occurrence, particularly across eastern and northern New Zealand, is also projected to affect primary sector operations and production (medium confidence) (King et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2017; Awatere et al., 2018). Further, many Māori-owned lands and cultural assets, such as marae and urupa, are located on coastal lowlands vulnerable to sea level rise (SLR) impacts (high confidence) (Manning et al., 2014; Hardy et al., 2019). Māori tribal investment in fisheries and aquaculture faces substantial risks from changes in ocean temperature and acidification and the downstream impacts on species distribution, productivity and yields (medium confidence) (Law et al., 2016). A clearer understanding of climate change risks and the implications for sustainable outcomes can enable more informed decisions by tribal organisations and governance groups."

The production and ecology of some keystone cultural flora and fauna may be impacted by projected warming temperatures and reductions in rainfall (medium confidence) (RSNZ, 2016; Bond et al., 2019; Egan et al., 2020). Obstruction of access to keystone species is expected to adversely impact customary practice, cultural identity and well-being (medium confidence) (Jones et al., 2014; Bond et al., 2019). Social-cultural networks and conventions that promote collective action and mutual support are central features of many Māori communities, and these practices are invaluable for initiating responses to, and facilitating recovery from, climate stresses and extreme events (King et al., 2011; Hopkins et al., 2015). Māori tribal organisations have a critical role in defining climate risks and policy responses (Bargh et al., 2014; Parsons et al., 2019), as well as entering into strategic partnerships with business, science, research and government to address these risks (high confidence) (Manning et al., 2014; Beall and Brocklesby, 2017; CCATWG, 2017)."
wg2_ch11_11.4.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"More integrated assessments of climate change impacts, adaptation and socioeconomic risk for different Māori groups and communities, in the context of multiple stresses, inequities and different ways of knowing and being (King et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2017; Henwood et al., 2019), would assist those striving to evaluate impacts and risks and how to integrate these assessments into adaptation plans (high confidence). Better understanding of the social, cultural and fiscal implications of sea level rise (SLR) is urgent (PCE, 2015; Rouse et al., 2017; Colliar and Blackett, 2018), including what duties local and central government might have with respect to actively upholding Māori interests under the Treaty of Waitangi (high confidence) (Iorns Magallanes, 2019). Intergenerational approaches to climate change planning will become increasingly important, elevating political discussions about conceptions of rationality, diversity and the rights of non-human entities (high confidence) (Ritchie, 2013; Carter et al., 2018; Ruru, 2018; Munshi et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch11_11.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"The impacts and adaptation processes described in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 are focused on specific sectors, systems and Indigenous Peoples. Added complexity, risk and adaptation potential stem from cross-sectoral and cross-regional interdependencies."

Cascading impacts propagate via interconnections and systemic factors, including supply chains, shared reliance on connected biophysical systems (e.g., water catchments and ecosystems), infrastructure, essential goods and services and the exercise of governance, leadership, regulation, resources and standard practices (e.g., in planning and building codes), including lock-in of past decisions and experience (CSIRO, 2018; Lawrence et al., 2020b). The capacity of critical systems such as information, communication and technology, water infrastructure, health care, electricity and transport networks, is being stretched, with impacts cascading to other systems and places, exacerbating existing hazards and generating new risks (Cradock-Henry, 2017) (11.3.6; 11.3.10; Box 11.1). Temporal or spatial overlap of hazards (e.g., drought, extreme heat and fire; drought followed by extreme rainfall) are compounding impacts (Zscheischler et al., 2018) and affecting multiple sectors."
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and fires have caused deaths and injuries (Deloitte, 2017a) (11.3.5.1), and affected many households, communities and businesses via impacts on ecosystems, critical infrastructure, essential services, food production, the national economy, valued places and employment. This has created long-lasting impacts (e.g., mental health, homelessness, health incidents and reduced health services) (Brown et al., 2017; Brookfield and Fitzgerald, 2018; Rychetnik et al., 2019) and reduced adaptive capacity (Friel et al., 2014; O’Brien et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2015; CoA, 2020e) (Box 11.1, Box 11.3, 11.3.1–11.3.10)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"In New Zealand, extreme snow, rainfall and wind events have combined to impact road networks, power and water supplies and have impeded interdependent wastewater and stormwater services and business activities (Deloitte, 2019; Lawrence et al., 2020b; MfE, 2020a) (Box 11.4). Community and infrastructure services are periodically disrupted during extreme weather events, triggering impacts from the interdependencies across enterprises and individuals (Glavovic, 2014; Paulik et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Slow-onset climate change impacts have also had cascading and compounding effects. For example, degradation of the GBR by ocean heating, acidification and non-climatic pressures (Marshall et al., 2019), repeated pluvial, fluvial and coastal flooding of some settlements (Paulik et al., 2019a; Paulik et al., 2020), long droughts and water insecurity in rural communities (Tschakert et al., 2017) and the gradual loss of species and ecological communities have caused substantial ecological, social and economic losses. Indigenous Peoples have especially been impacted by multiple and complex losses (Johnson et al., 2021) (11.4)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts are projected to grow due to a concurrent increase in heatwaves, droughts, fires, storms, floods and sea level (high confidence) (CSIRO, 2020; Lawrence et al., 2020b). Urban wastewater, stormwater and water supply systems are particularly vulnerable in New Zealand (Paulik et al., 2019a; Hughes et al., 2021) to pluvial flooding (Box 11.4) and to sea level rise (SLR) (Box 11.6), with flow-on effects to settlements, insurance and finance sectors, and governments (Lawrence et al., 2020b). Furthermore, consecutive heavy rainfall events in late summer and autumn, following drought conditions in low-lying modified wetland areas, have implications for the operation of flood control infrastructure as increased rainfall intensity, land subsidence and sea level rise (SLR) compound and result in the retention of floodwaters (Pingram et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"In Australia, the aggregate loss of wealth due to climate-induced reductions in productivity across agriculture, manufacturing and service sectors is projected to exceed AUD$19 billion by 2030, AUD$211 billion by 2050 and AUD$4 trillion by 2100 for RCP8.5 (Steffen et al., 2019) (Table 11.13). Projected impacts also cascade across national boundaries via value chains, markets, movement of humans and other organisms and geopolitics (e.g., migration from near-neighbours as a pathway for adaptation, mobile climate-sensitive diseases and changes in production and trade patterns) (Lee et al., 2018; Nalau and Handmer, 2018; Schwerdtle et al., 2018; Dellink et al., 2019). The scale of impacts is projected to challenge the adaptive capacity of sectors, governments and institutions (Steffen et al., 2019), including the insurability of assets and risks to lenders (Storey and Noy, 2017)."

Estimates for later in the century are speculative because both impacts and adaptation are uncertain.)
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Coordinating adaptation strategies and addressing underlying exposure and vulnerability can increase resilience to cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts (high confidence) (Table 11.17; 11.7.3). Systems understanding, network analysis, stress testing, spatial mapping, collaboration, information sharing and interoperability across states, sectors, agencies and value chains, as well as national-scale facilitation, can increase adaptive capacity (Espada et al., 2015; CoA, 2020e; Cradock-Henry et al., 2020b; Jozaei et al., 2020). Greater system diversity, modularity, redundancy, adaptability and decentralised control can reduce the risk of cascading failures and system breakdown (Sinclair et al., 2017; Sellberg et al., 2018). Addressing existing vulnerabilities in systems can reduce susceptibility and improve the resilience of interdependent systems (11.7.3). Multi-level leadership, including national and sub-national policies, laws and finance can reduce and manage aggregate risks supported by the enablers in Table 11.17."

There is uncertainty about whether standard integrated assessment models can estimate cascading and compounding impacts across systems and sectors, but systems methodologies and social network analysis hold promise (Stoerk et al., 2018; Cradock-Henry et al., 2020b). Interventions at the landscape, building and individual scales can reduce the negative health effects of current and future extreme heat, if integrated in well-communicated heat action plans with robust surveillance and monitoring (Jay et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"In Australia, the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework (CoA, 2018b), National Recovery and Resilience Agency and Australian Climate Service (CoA, 2021) can provide some support for adaptation across multiple sectors. New Zealand has effective partnerships across critical infrastructure through lifelines groups, but organisational silos and lack of stress testing of plans hamper coordinated decision-making during crises and for adaptation (Brown et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2020b). The New Zealand national risk assessment, national adaptation plan, forthcoming Climate Change Adaptation Act and monitoring of adaptation progress by the Climate Change Commission provide a framework for anticipating climate change risks (MfE, 2020a)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.2_p1,11.5.2.1 Observed Impacts ,"The implications of climate change for national economies are significant (high confidence). The costs associated with lost productivity, disaster relief expenditure and unfunded contingent liabilities represent a major risk to financial system stability (MfE, 2020a). Costs include significant and often long-term social impacts, temporary dislocation, business disruption and impacts on employment, education, community networks, health and well-being (Deloitte, 2017a). Climate change disrupts international patterns of agricultural production and trade in ways that may be negative but that also may lead to new opportunities for agriculture (Mosnier et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2018). Net exports may increase following global climate shocks (Lee et al., 2018), but the longer-term effects on GDP are likely  to be negative (Dellink et al., 2019)."

Insured losses from weather-related disasters cost almost NZD$1 billion during 2015–2021 (ICNZ, 2021). Floods cost the New Zealand economy at least NZD$120 million for privately insured damages between 2007 and 2017 (D. Frame et al., 2018). The 2007/2008 drought cost NZD$3.2 billion and the 2012/13 drought cost NZD$1.6 billion, of which about 20% could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Frame et al., 2020) (11.3.11)."

While often incommensurable, intangible costs may be far higher than the tangible costs. For example, following the Victorian fires in 2009, the tangible costs were AUD$3.1 billion while the intangible costs were AUD$3.4 billion; following the Queensland floods in 2010/2011, the tangible costs were AUD$6.7 billion while the intangible costs were AUD$7.4 billion (Deloitte, 2016)."
wg2_ch11_11.5.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The economic long-run impact increases with higher levels of warming (high confidence), but there is a wide range in projections. Conservative estimates for the long-run impacts of a 1°C, 2°C or 3°C global warming (relative to 1986–2005) on Australian GDP are −0.3, −0.6 and −1.1%/year, respectively, while for New Zealand the estimates are −0.1, −0.4 and −0.8%/year respectively (Kompas et al., 2018). More detailed modelling indicates a loss in Australia’s GDP of 6% by 2070 for 3°C global warming, while a 2.6% GDP rise by 2070 is possible for 1.5°C global warming (Deloitte, 2020). The potential for much more severe effects on GDP is shown in recent estimates, which attempt to account for the increased severity of uncertain effects (e.g., up to 18.5% reduction in Australia’s GDP by mid-century) (Swiss Re, 2021)."

National damage costs and impacts on asset values could be significant (Table 11.13). The macroeconomic shocks induced from climate change, including reduced agricultural yields, damage to property and infrastructure and commodity price increases, could lead to significant market corrections and potential financial instability (Steffen et al., 2019). Under a ‘slow decline’ scenario by 2060 where Australia fails to adequately address climate change and sustainability challenges, GDP is projected to grow at 0.7% less per year and real wages would be 50% lower than under an ‘outlook scenario’ where Australia meets climate change and sustainability challenges (CSIRO, 2019)."

Barriers to effective adaptation include governance inertia at all levels, hindering the development of careful and comprehensive adaptation plans and their implementation (Boston and Lawrence, 2018; MfE and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, 2020; White and Lawrence, 2020). Lack of clarity about mandate, roles and leadership and inadequate funding for adaptation by national and state governments and sectors, are slowing adaptation (Lukasiewicz et al., 2017; Waters and Barnett, 2018; LGNZ, 2019; MfE, 2020c) (11.3; 11.7.1). Established planning tools and measures were designed for static risk profiles, and practitioners are slow to take up tools better suited to changing climate risks (CoA, 2020e; Schneider et al., 2020) (11.5; Box 11.5). The communication of relevant climate change information remains ad hoc (Stevens and O’Connor, 2015; CCATWG, 2017; Palutikof et al., 2019c; Salmon, 2019). In Australia, the lack of national guidance or adaptation laws creates barriers to adaptation, reflected in uneven coastal adaptation based on a wait-and-see approach (Dedekorkut-Howes et al., 2020)."

Recent institutional changes in New Zealand indicate that this is changing (11.7.1; Table 15b). Many groups are yet to engage deeply with climate change adaptation (Kench et al., 2018), and some adaptation processes are being blocked (Pearce et al., 2018; Garmestani et al., 2019; Alexandra, 2020) or exploited to deflect from mitigation responsibilities (Smith and Lawrence, 2018; Nyberg and Wright, 2020). Some actors are resistant to using climate change information (Tangney and Howes, 2016; Alexandra, 2020). Fear of litigation and demands for compensation can contribute to this reluctance (Tombs et al., 2018; O’Donnell et al., 2019)and is increasingly inviting litigation and other costs (Hodder, 2019; Bell-James and Collins, 2020 ). Jurisprudence is evolving from cases on projects to cases about decision-making accountability in the public and private sectors (Bell-James and Collins, 2020 ; Peel et al., 2020) and rights-based cases (Peel and Osofsky, 2018). National and sub-national governments may become exposed to unsustainable fiscal risk as insurers of last resort, which can lead to inequitable outcomes for vulnerable groups and future generations (11.3.8), path dependencies and negative effects on physical, social, economic and cultural systems (Hamin and Gurran, 2015; Boston and Lawrence, 2018). Cross-scale governance tensions can prevent local adaptation initiatives from performing as intended (Tschakert et al., 2016; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2019).

No-regrets decisions are likely  to be insufficient (Hallegatte et al., 2012). A perception exists in some sectors that all climate risks are manageable based on past experience (CCATWG, 2017). Projected impacts, however, are outside the range experienced, meaning that decisions must be made now for long-lived assets, land uses and communities exposed to the key risks (Paulik et al., 2019a; Paulik et al., 2020) often under contested conditions where adaptation competes with other public expenditures (Kwakkel et al., 2016). New planning approaches being used across the region can enable more effective adaptation, for example continual iterative adaptation (Khan et al., 2015), rapid deployment of decision tools appropriate for addressing uncertainties (Marchau et al., 2019) and transformation of governance and institutional arrangements (Boston and Lawrence, 2018) (Table 11.17).

Novel approaches to building climate change literacy and adaptation capability go hand in hand with dedicated expert organisational support (Stevens and O’Connor, 2015; CCATWG, 2018; Palutikof et al., 2019c; Salmon, 2019). All of these approaches depend on adequate resourcing (very high confidence)."
wg2_ch11_11.7.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,There are two priority areas where new knowledge is critical for accelerating adaptation implementation.
wg2_ch11_11.8_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation to climate risks and global mitigation of greenhouse emissions determine whether development pathways are climate-resilient (Chapter 18). In the near term, progress towards climate resilient development can be monitored by progress on the SDGs. According to government reports (Figure 11.6) (OECD, 2019a), current and projected trajectories fall short of meeting all targets (Allen et al., 2019). Key climate risks for the region (11.6, Table 11.14) affect all of the SDGs, and pre-existing societal inequalities exacerbate climate risks (11.3.5). Projected climate risks combined with underlying SDG indicators will increasingly impede the region’s capacity to achieve and maintain a number of SDGs, including sustainable agriculture, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, life below water and life on land (OECD, 2019a). Reducing these risks would require significant and rapid emission reductions to keep global warming to 1.5°C–2.0°C and robust and timely adaptation (IPCC, 2018)."
wg2_ch11_11.8.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"A step change in adaptation action is needed to address climate risks and to be consistent with climate resilient development (very high confidence). Current adaptation falls short on the assessment of complex risks, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. It is largely incremental and temporary given the scale of projected impacts; it has limits and is mainly reactive rather than anticipatory. Furthermore, risks are projected to cascade and compound, with impacts and costs that challenge adaptive capacities (11.5) and call for transformational responses (11.6, Table 11.15a, Table 11.15b; Supplementary Tables SM11.1a and SM11.1b)."
wg2_ch11_11.8.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Current global emissions reduction policies are projected to lead to a global warming of 2.1°C–3.9°C by 2100 (Liu and Raftery, 2021), leaving many of the region’s human and natural systems at very high risk and beyond adaptation limits (high confidence). With higher levels of warming, adaptation costs increase, loss and damages grow, and governance and institutional responses reduce adaptive capacity. Underlying social and economic vulnerabilities and injustices further reduce adaptive capacity, exacerbating disadvantage in particular groups in society. Sustainable development across and beyond the region will help reduce shared adaptation challenges (11.5.1.2). Effective adaptation avoids lock-in and path dependency, reduces vulnerabilities, increases flexibility to change, builds adaptive capacity and advances SDGs, thereby improving intra- and intergenerational justice (11.5, 11.6, 11.7). Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and structural inequalities is key to achieving the SDGs and contributing to climate resilient development."
wg2_ch11_11.8.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Integrated and inclusive adaptation decision-making can contribute to climate resilient development by better mediating competing values, interests and priorities and helping to reconcile short- and long-term objectives, as well as public and private costs and benefits, in the face of rapidly and continuously changing risk profiles  (very high confidence) (Gorddard et al., 2016; MfE, 2017a; Schlosberg et al., 2017) (11.5.2). Use of new tools and approaches (Table 11.18) to address system interactions that match the scale and scope of the problem can result in more effective adaptation, including proactive and anticipatory governance and institutional enablers (11.7, Table 11.17) (Schlosberg et al., 2017; Boston and Lawrence, 2018). Building cities and settlements that are resilient to the impacts of climate change requires the simultaneous consideration of infrastructural, ecological, social, economic, institutional and political dimensions of resilience, including political will, leadership, commitment, community support, multi-level governance and policy continuity (Torabi et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch11_11.8.1_p4,NO_TITLE,Table 11.18 | Examples of adaptation decision tools
wg2_ch11_11.8.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Implementing enablers can help drive adaptation ambition and action consistent with climate resilient development (very high confidence) (11.7.3, Table 11.17). However, the scale and scope of cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts (11.5.1) calls for new and timely adaptation, including more effective ongoing monitoring, evaluation, review and continual adjustment (11.7.3) towards the transformations that can break through the path dependencies that define the way things are done now (Cradock-Henry et al., 2018b; UN et al., 2018; Head, 2020). However, complex interactions between objectives can create social and economic trade-offs (Table 11.1, 11.3.5.3, 11.7.3.1, Box 11.6)."
wg2_ch11_11.8.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The region faces an extremely challenging future that will be highly disruptive for many human and natural systems (IPCC, 2018) (UNEP, 2020; AAS, 2021; IPCC, 2021) (11.5.1, 11.6, 11.7; Boxes 11.1–11.6; Table 11.14). The extent to which the limits to adaptation are reached depends on whether global warming peaks this century at 1.5°C, 2°C or 3+°C above pre-industrial levels. Whatever the outcome, adaptation and mitigation are essential and urgent (very high confidence)."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Temperature has increased by 1.4°C in Australia and 1.1°C in New Zealand over the last 110 years, with more extreme hot days. The oceans in the region have warmed significantly, resulting in longer and more frequent marine heatwaves. Sea levels have risen and the oceans have become more acidic. Snow depths have declined and glaciers have receded. Northwestern Australia and most of southern New Zealand have become wetter, while southern Australia and most of northern New Zealand have become drier. The frequency, severity and duration of extreme wildfire weather conditions have increased in southern and eastern Australia and northeastern New Zealand."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The impacts of climate change on marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and species are evident. The mass mortality of corals throughout the Great Barrier Reef during marine heatwaves in 2016–2020 is a striking example. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented south-eastern Australia wildfires in the spring and summer of 2019–2020, loss of alpine habitats in Australia, extensive loss of kelp forests, shifts further south in the distribution of almost 200 marine species, decline and extinction in some vertebrate species in the Australian wet tropics, expansion of invasive plants, animals and pathogens in New Zealand, erosion and flooding of coastal habitats in New Zealand, river flow decline in southern Australia, increased stress in rural communities, insurance losses for floods in New Zealand, increase in heatwave mortalities in Australian capital cities and fish deaths in the Murray-Darling River in the summer of 2018–2019."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Risk is the combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. For a given hazard (e.g., fire), the risk will be greater in areas with high exposure (e.g., many houses) and/or high vulnerability (e.g., remote communities with limited escape routes). The severity and type of climate risk varies geographically (Figure FAQ11.2.1). Everyone will be affected by climate change, with disadvantaged and remote people and communities the most vulnerable."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The risks to natural and human systems are often compounded by impacts across multiple spatial and temporal scales. For example, fires damage property, farms, forests and nature with short- and long-term effects on biodiversity, natural resources, human health, communities and the economy. Major impacts across multiple sectors can disrupt supply chains to industries and communities and constrain delivery of health, energy, water and food services. These impacts create challenges for the adaptation and governance of climate risks. When combined, they have far-reaching socioeconomic and environmental impacts."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Indigenous Australians—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—maintain knowledge regarding previous sea level rise, climate patterns and shifts in seasonal change associated with the flowering of trees and emergence of food sources, developed over thousands of generations of observation of their traditional country. Knowledge of localised contemporary adaptation is also held by many Indigenous Australians with connections to traditional lands. With assured free and prior informed consent, this provides a means for Indigenous-guided land management, including for fire management and carbon abatement, fauna studies, medicinal plant products, threatened species recovery, water management and weed management."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Tangata Whenua Māori in New Zealand are grounded in Mātauranga Māori knowledge, which is based on human–nature relationships and ecological integrity and incorporates practices used to detect and anticipate changes taking place in the environment. Social-cultural networks and conventions that promote collective action and mutual support are central features of many Māori communities and these customary approaches are critical to responding to, and recovering from, adverse environmental conditions. Intergenerational approaches to planning for the future are also intrinsic to Māori social-cultural organisation and are expected to become increasingly important, elevating political discussions about conceptions of rationality, diversity and the rights of non-human entities in climate change policy and adaptation."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"We currently mainly react to climate events such as wildfires, heatwaves, floods and droughts and generally rebuild in the same places. However, climate change is making these events more frequent and intense, and ongoing sea level rise and changes in natural ecosystems are advancing. Better coordination and collaboration between government agencies, communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and Tangata Whenua Indigenous Peoples, not-for-profit organisations and businesses will help prepare for these climate impacts more proactively, in combination with future climate risks integrated into their decisions and planning. This will reduce the impacts we experience now and the risks that will affect future generations."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Some of the risks for natural systems are close to critical thresholds and adaptation may be unable to prevent ecosystem collapse. Other risks will be severe, but we can reduce their impact by acting now, for example coastal flooding from sea level rise, heat-related mortality and managing water stresses. Many of the risks have the potential to cascade across social and economic sectors with widespread societal impacts. In such cases, really significant system-wide changes will be needed in the way we currently live and govern. To facilitate such changes, new governance frameworks, nationally consistent and accessible information, collaborative engagement and partnerships with all sectors, communities and Indigenous Peoples and the resources to address the risks are needed (Figure FAQ11.4.1)."
wg2_ch11_FAQ 11.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"However, our ability to adapt to climate change impacts also rests on every region in the world playing its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If mitigation is ineffective, global warming will be rapid and adaptation costs will increase, with worsening losses and damages."
