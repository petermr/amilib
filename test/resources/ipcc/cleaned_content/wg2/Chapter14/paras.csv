Climate change affects human and natural systems; this chapter provides an assessment of present and future climate-change impacts, risks and adaptation for North America, including Mexico, Canada, the USA and coastal waters within the 370-km exclusive economic zone. We do not consider Hawaii and other island territories of the USA in depth as they are assessed in Chapter 15. Chapter 14 assesses evidence from Arctic Canada and Alaska, which is synthesised in  Cross-Chapter Paper 6 Polar Regions (CCP6)."
wg2_ch14_14.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Evidence from Indigenous knowledge (IK) systems is included in this chapter to assess climate-change risks and solutions in North America following the framing provided in Chapter 1 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) (Abram et al., 2019) and Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (IPCC, 2019a). Indigenous contributing authors provided this assessment, reflecting the importance of meaningfully including IK in assessment processes (Ford, 2012; Ford et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2020). This addition represents an important advancement since AR5 (IPCC, 2013; IPCC, 2014)."
wg2_ch14_14.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Our main point of departure was the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for WGII (IPCC, 2014). Key findings drawn from the Executive Summary for the North America chapter are summarised in Table 14.1. Subsequent IPCC reports, such as Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC, 2018), SROCC (IPCC, 2019b) and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a), also informed the assessment. We additionally incorporated recent national climate assessments of the USA (USGCRP, 2018) and Canada (Bush and Lemmen, 2019; Warren and Lulham, 2021) as well as the Sixth National Communication of Mexico to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (SEMARNAT and INECC, 2018)."

wg2_ch14_14.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Chapter 14 sections are organised to address themes and content as contained in the IPCC-approved outline for regions. Regional climate changes assessed within North America are keyed to Figure 14.1 using four-letter abbreviations (e.g., CA-ON, US-SE, MX-NW). The assessment addresses recent and future climate for North America, the impacts, risks and adaptations within sectors, key risksacross sectors (KR), the nature of adaptation and sustainable development pathways as well as two additional sections on Indigenous Peoples and perceptions of climate change. Seven boxes are used to highlight topics of interdisciplinary nature while four frequently asked questions (FAQ) were produced in plain language for communication to the public. The chapter utilises the framework as well as designated terms in the standardised process for evaluating and characterising the degree of certainty in assessment findings developed through the expert judgement process (Section 1.3.4; Mach et al., 2017). The Glossary [Annex II] provides definitions for terms and concepts used across the report."
wg2_ch14_14.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"With a 2019 total population of over 494 million people (USA 329 million, Mexico 128 million and Canada 37 million), North America comprises 6.4% of the global population. Relative to other countries, North American countries have low population densities per square kilometre (Mexico 64 people, USA 35 people and Canada 4 people) (United Nations, 2019). Population projections indicate a steady growth in the three countries, which will exert pressure on consumption and increase risks under climate change (United Nations, 2019). North America is also responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since 1990, North American GHG emissions have increased by almost 18% (Ritchie and Roser, 2020), and in 2019 the region was responsible for 5.9 MtCO2 emissions worldwide (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). In terms of annual CO2 emissions per capita, in 2019 Canada had 15 metric tons of CO2 per person (tCO2 per person), the USA had 16 tCO2 per person and Mexico had 3.4 tCO2 per person (Friedlingstein et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch14_14.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Trends in observed and projected physical climate variables, and changes in extreme weather and climate events, are summarised in this section. Many of the assessments here are adapted from AR6 WGI (IPCC, 2021), especially Chapters 11 (Seneviratne et al., 2021) and 12 (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), and the Atlas (Gutiérrez et al., 2021a, b). Ranasinghe et al., 2021, Section 12.4.6, assesses North American climatic impact drivers without assessing their impacts or associated risks. The WGI assessments are augmented in this section with regionally specific support from recent national climate assessments or original literature."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate changes directly related to increasing mean and extreme temperature, including reduced snowpack, sea and lake ice and glacier extent, and marine heatwaves (MHWs), can be attributed to human activity and are affecting most of North America (high confidence). Upward trends in annual mean temperature across North America since 1960 are widespread (Gutiérrez et al., 2021a) but non-uniform (Figure 14.2A). Pronounced polar amplification of warming is observed in high latitudes (Figure 14.2A), particularly in winter (Gutiérrez et al., 2021a; Vose et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a). As average temperature rises, extreme high temperature records across North America are being set more frequently than extreme cold records (Meehl et al., 2016) and the probability of cold extreme events is reduced (WGI Chapter11 [Seneviratne et al., 2021 ]). Trends in daily maximum and minimum temperature are significant in high latitudes (US-AK, CA-NW, CA-NE). Summer daily maximum temperature is increasing in southwest desert regions (US-SW, MX-NW) (Martinez-Austria et al., 2016; Martinez-Austria and Bandala, 2017; Navarro-Estupinan et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Annual precipitation has increased in recent decades in northern and eastern areas (CA-PR, CA-QU, US-NP, US-SP, US-MW, US-NE, US-AK) (high confidence), and has decreased across the western part of the continent (CA-BC, US-SW, US-NW, MX-NW) (medium confidence), with considerable spatial variability within these regions (Zhang et al., 2019a; Gutiérrez et al., 2021a). Elsewhere across North America there is limited evidence and low agreement  on detection of observed trends in total precipitation and river flood hazards. The intensity and frequency of 1-day heavy precipitation events have very likely 2  increased since the mid-20th Century across most of the USA (US-NP, US-MW, US-NE, but not in US-SE) and in Mexico, but no detectable trend is reported in Canada (Seneviratne et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019a). Recent flooding events along the mid-latitude Pacific Coast have been attributed to increasingly intense atmospheric river events ( Douville et al., 2021; Gershunov et al., 2019; Vano et al., 2019), but there is low confidence in detecting trends in atmospheric river activity."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Snowpack and snow extent across much of Canada and the western USA have declined as temperatures have increased (very high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Gutierrez et al., 2021a; Kunkel et al., 2016; Mote et al., 2018; Mudryk et al., 2018; Derksen et al., 2019). Warm ‘snow droughts’ describing a deficit of snowpack available for runoff, even in the absence of a winter precipitation deficit (Cooper et al., 2016; Harpold et al., 2017), have become more common in North American mountains (Sproles et al., 2016; Nicholls et al., 2018; Pershing et al., 2018). Glaciers have retreated over the past half-century at high elevation across North America (Frans et al., 2018; Zemp et al., 2019) and in the Arctic (Burgess, 2017; Box et al., 2019; Derksen et al., 2019). Lake ice in Canada, south of the Arctic region delineated in Figure 14.1, has declined (Alexeev et al., 2016; Derksen et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"There is limited evidence of trends in meteorological or hydrological droughts over the historical record (see Douville et al. (2021) and Seneviratne et al. (2021) for multiple perspectives on drought; Wehner et al., 2017), but there is medium confidence in increasing atmospheric evaporative demand acting to intensify surface aridity during recent droughts (e.g., US-SW) (Seneviratne et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2020). The ongoing multi-decadal dry period in the Colorado River basin is as extreme as any drought in the past 1000 years (Murphy and Ellis, 2019; Williams et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The proportion of hurricanes in stronger categories has likely  increased globally over the past 40 years, with medium confidence that the onshore propagation speed of hurricanes making landfall in the USA has slowed detectably since 1900 (Seneviratne et al., 2021; Kossin, 2018), contributing to detectable increases in local rainfall and coastal flooding associated with these storms. There is high confidence (Seneviratne et al., 2021) that anthropogenic climate change has contributed to extreme precipitation associated with recent intense hurricanes, such as Harvey in 2017."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"North American sea ice extent and volume (thickness) have declined up to 10% per decade  since 1981 (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2017; Mudryk et al., 2018; Derksen et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019b), with changes accelerating during this time (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Schweiger et al., 2019), resulting in longer and larger periods of open water (Wang et al., 2018a). Recent (2018) sea ice extent in the Bering Sea was the lowest in a 5500-year record and appears to lag atmospheric CO2 by about two decades (Jones et al. 2021). High Arctic sea ice retreat since 1971 and increases in open-water duration in the most recent decade are unprecedented (Box et al., 2019) and most pronounced in the Chukchi, Bering and Beaufort seas (US-AK, CA-NW) (high confidence) (Wang and Overland, 2015; Jones et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Warming of North American offshore waters is significant and attributable to human activities, particularly along the Atlantic coast, contributing to sea level rise (SLR) through thermal expansion (very high confidence) (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; IPCC, 2019b). Rates of SLR have accelerated along most North American coasts during the past three decades, excepting coastlines in southern Alaska (US-AK) and northeastern Canada (CA-QC, CA-NE) where land is rising (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Greenan et al., 2018). Tidal flooding frequency has increased in the North Pacific from once every 1–3 years to every 6–12 months (Sweet et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch14_14.2.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Acidification of North American coastal waters has occurred in conjunction with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration (Mathis et al., 2015; Jewett and Romanou, 2017; Claret et al., 2018) combined with other local acidifying inputs such as nitrogen and sulphur deposition (Doney et al., 2007) and freshwater nutrient input (very high confidence) (Strong et al., 2014; IPCC, 2019b). Oxygen minimum zones, particularly in the North Pacific south of US-AK, have expanded in volume and O2 has declined since 1970 (IPCC, 2019b)."

Extreme heatwaves are projected to intensify, particularly in MX-NW, MX-N, MX-NE, US-SW, US-NP and US-SP (Figure 14.2F,G) and become more frequent and longer in duration as average temperature rises across North America  (Seneviratne et al., 2021).

Further increases in the intensity of locally heavy precipitation are very likely  across the continent, as a greater fraction of precipitation falls in intense events (Easterling et al., 2017; Prein et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2019a)."
wg2_ch14_14.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"High-humidity hazards are projected to increase (medium confidence) in regions around the Gulf of Mexico and southeast North America (US-SE, US-SP, MX-NE, MX-SE) (Zhao et al., 2015). In subtropical regions that are less influenced by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico (including US-SW, US-SP, MX-NW and MX-N), the combination of higher temperature and less total precipitation leads to projections of increased aridity: drier surface conditions, higher evaporative demand by plants and more intense droughts (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Jones and Gutzler, 2016; Easterling et al., 2017; Escalante-Sandoval and Nuñez-Garcia, 2017)."

These changes include declines in snowmelt runoff (Li et al., 2017), increased evaporative losses during snow ablation (Foster et al., 2016; Milly and Dunne, 2020), as well as increases in the frequency of rain-on-snow events (Jeong and Sushama, 2018a) and consecutive snow drought years in western North America (Marshall et al., 2019a)."

wg2_ch14_14.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The majority of the climate science community has reached consensus that mean global temperature has increased and human activity is a major cause (Oreskes, 2004; Anderegg et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2016; IPCC, 2021), setting the context for public policy action. Despite expert scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, there is polarisation and an ongoing debate over the reality of anthropogenic climate change in the public and policy domains, with attendant risks to society (high confidence) (Doran and Zimmerman, 2009; Ballew et al., 2019; Druckman and McGrath, 2019; Hornsey and Fielding, 2020; Wong-Parodi and Feygina, 2020). Public perception of consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change can be an important gateway belief, which establishes a crucial precondition for public policy action (van der Linden et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 2019) by influencing the assessment of climate-change risks and opportunities, and formulation of appropriate mitigation and adaptation responses (Ding et al., 2011; Bolsen et al., 2015; Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016; Doll et al., 2017; Mase et al., 2017; Morton et al., 2017). Trust in experts, institutions and environmental groups is also important (Cologna and Siegrist, 2020; Termini and Kalafatis, 2021)."
wg2_ch14_14.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Rhetoric and misinformation on climate change and the deliberate undermining of science have contributed to misperceptions of the scientific consensus, uncertainty, disregarded risk and urgency, and dissent (high confidence) (Ding et al., 2011; Oreskes and Conway, 2011; Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014; Cook et al., 2017; van der Linden et al., 2017). Additionally, strong party affiliation and partisan opinion polarisation contribute to delayed mitigation and adaptation action, most notably in the USA (high confidence) (van der Linden et al., 2015; Cook and Lewandowsky, 2016; Bolsen and Druckman, 2018; Chinn et al., 2020) but with similar patterns in Canada (medium confidence) (Lachapelle et al., 2012; Kevins and Soroka, 2018). Vocal groups can affect public discourse and weaken public support for climate mitigation and adaptation policies (medium confidence) (Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014; Lewandowsky et al., 2019). Vested economic and political interests have organised and financed misinformation and ‘contrarian’ climate-change communication (Brulle, 2014; Farrell, 2016a; Farrell, 2016b; Supran and Oreskes, 2017; Bolsen and Druckman, 2018; Brulle, 2018). Traditional media–print and broadcast–frame and transmit climate-change information and play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions, understanding and willingness to act (Happer and Philo, 2013; Schmidt et al., 2013; Hmielowski et al., 2014; Bolsen and Shapiro, 2018; King et al., 2019; Chinn et al., 2020). The journalistic norm of ‘balance’ (giving equal weight to climate scientists and contrarians in climate-change reporting) biases coverage by unevenly amplifying certain messages that are not supported by science, contributing to politicisation of science, spreading of misinformation and reducing public consensus on action (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004; Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007; Cook et al., 2017). Much online social media discussion of climate change takes place in ‘echo chambers’–a social network among like-minded people in communities dominated by a single view that contributes to polarisation (Williams et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2019) and the spread of misinformation (Treen et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch14_14.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"In a 2018 survey across 26 nations, people in Canada and Mexico ranked climate change as the top global threat, whereas in the USA climate change ranked third (Poushter and Huang, 2019). The public’s responses to the causes of climate change and risk perceptions in Canada (Mildenberger et al., 2016) and the USA (Howe et al., 2015) have revealed variations among regions (Figure 14.3) and less acceptance of climate change in rural regions than in urban areas. Canadian regions have higher acceptance of climate change (e.g., recognise it is happening and attributable to human activity) than the most liberal areas in the USA (Lachapelle et al., 2012; Mildenberger et al., 2016). Western Canadian regions with high carbon intensity economies had lower acceptance of climate change than the rest of Canada, whereas in the USA perceptions were more stable across regions (Lachapelle et al., 2012). A recent survey in Mexico found that for 73% of respondents climate change represents a major economic, environmental and social threat, and in the most vulnerable states (MX-SE), the perception is that climate-change impacts and extreme events have considerable implications for the way of life in communities (Zamora Saenz, 2018). In a 2017 survey, Azócar et al. (2021) found that 85% of respondents from Mexico acknowledged anthropogenic climate change. Peoples’ experience with extreme events (e.g., hurricanes, high temperatures), socio-demographic characteristics, level of marginalisation and economic and social exclusion, as well as education levels, were important factors influencing perception of climate change in Mexico (Corona-Jimenez, 2018; Alfie and Cruz-Bello, 2021; Azócar et al., 2021). Drawing upon Indigenous knowledge (see Box 14.1) as well as lived experience of recent changes in ice, weather patterns, and species’ phenology and distribution, Indigenous Peoples recognise that change is occurring in their communities and have effective solutions that are grounded in Indigenous world views (Harrington, 2006; Turner and Clifton, 2009; Norton-Smith et al., 2016a ; Savo et al., 2016; Maldonado et al., 2017; Chisholm Hatfield et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch14_14.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Building consensus for action on climate change is influenced by individual factors (e.g., ideology, world view, trust, partisan identity, religion, education, age) and the broader societal context (e.g., culture, media coverage and content, political climate, economic conditions) (high confidence) (McCright and Dunlap, 2011; Brulle et al., 2012; Hornsey et al., 2016; Arbuckle, 2017; Pearson et al., 2017; Bolsen and Shapiro, 2018; Ballew et al., 2020; Cologna and Siegrist, 2020; Goldberg et al., 2020). In a multi-country assessment of acceptance of global warming influenced by ideology (e.g., conspiratorial ideation, individualism, hierarchy, and left–right and liberal–conservative political orientation), the USA uniquely had the strongest link to doubt out of 25 countries for all factors, while Canada’s dominant influence on non-acceptance was conservative political ideology, and for Mexico, there were no ideological effects (Hornsey et al., 2018)."

Fewer US republicans hold the belief that human activity causes climate change than democrats (Bolsen and Druckman, 2018; Druckman and McGrath, 2019). Partisanship in the USA with respect to climate change has evolved over the period 1997–2016; initially, it was limited, but since 2008, there has been a widening, more entrenched partisan ‘divide’ (Dunlap et al., 2016). The millennial generation (born in the 1980s and 1990s), emerging as the largest US population cohort, has a potentially important political influence–reduction in polarisation–as they show relatively higher levels of concern and acceptance of climate-change science than older age groups. Political affiliation does not have as strong an effect on their climate change beliefs (Corner et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2019)."

People may reject new information that conflicts with their beliefs or not consider it credible, as political ideology and partisan affiliation are strong influences (Arbuckle, 2017). The climate-change issue may create resistance from individuals with conservative political ideologies and hierarchical, individualistic world views because it ascribes responsibility to developed, industrialised countries for emissions and brings about more environmental regulation (Stevenson et al., 2015). Lack of trust in scientific consensus on climate change may actually originate from opposition by US conservatives to the perceived advocacy for different climate-change policy approaches that challenge their world views (Bolsen and Druckman, 2018)."

People can engage with climate change across three dimensions: cognitive (knowledge), affective (feelings) and behavioural (responses and actions) (Galway, 2019; Brosch, 2021). Risk assessment can be influenced by values regarding the subject under evaluation (Allison and Bassett, 2015; Stevenson et al., 2015) and can interact with other risks and change over time (Mach et al., 2016). Communities and practitioners (e.g., farmers, foresters, water managers) are influenced in their willingness to modify current practices and adopt new measures based on how they perceive, understand and experience climate-change uncertainty, risk and urgency as well as political and social norms (van Putten et al., 2015; Doll et al., 2017; Mase et al., 2017; Morton et al., 2017; Zanocco et al., 2018). Place-based and local-focused assessments allow individuals to more readily assess and adapt to risks as well as identify roles and responsibilities in the face of multiple, interacting and often unequally distributed climate-change impacts (Khan et al., 2018; Galway, 2019). Interest in preserving local archaeological sites threatened by SLR initiated collaboration and co-production of knowledge among disparate US communities: citizens, archaeologists, preservationists, planners, land managers and Indigenous Peoples (Fatorić and Seekamp, 2019; Dawson et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch14_14.3.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Psychological distancing–the perception that the greatest impacts occur sometime in the distant future and to people and places far away–can lead to discounting of risk and the need for adaptation (medium confidence) (Leviston et al., 2014; Mildenberger et al., 2019). Communication directed at local and personal framing of climate-change impact and risk information is one option for addressing low salience (Bolsen et al., 2019) particularly related to established risks such as SLR, flooding and wildfires in North America (Mildenberger et al., 2019). ‘Personalised’ risk communications have had mixed results creating behavioural change and policy support, and even caused resistance (Schoenefeld and McCauley, 2016). Communication focused extensively on risks and dangers of climate change can produce fear or dread, lessen agency and create fatalism that hinders action (Giddens, 2015; Mayer and Smith, 2019); it also can be labelled alarmist (Leiserowitz, 2005). Detailed SLR flooding maps for the San Francisco Bay area did not increase climate risk assessment but lessened personal risk perception of those with a strong belief in climate change, although policy preferences and support for adaptation did not change (Mildenberger et al., 2019). Defining coherent groups based on variations in beliefs, risk perceptions and policy preferences offers opportunities for effectively engaging with segments of the population instead of using the same approach for everyone (low confidence) (Maibach et al., 2011; Chryst et al., 2018).

The Indigenous Peoples of North America have contributed substantially to, and continue to contribute to, the growing literature, scholarship and research on climate change (Barreiro, 1999; Houser et al., 2001; Mustonen, 2005; Bennett et al., 2014; Maynard, 2014; Merculieff et al., 2017; FAQI, 2019; Ijaz, 2019; BIA, 2021). For thousands of years, Indigenous Peoples have developed and relied on their own knowledge systems for sustaining their health, cultures and arts, livelihoods and political security (Battiste and Henderson, 2000; Colombi, 2012; Nelson and Shilling, 2018). Diverse IK systems in North America consider weather and climate as major dimensions of understanding the relationship between society and the environment. Indigenous Peoples have distinct knowledge of climate change, over extensive temporal measures (Trosper, 2002; Barrera-Bassols and Toledo, 2005; Gearheard et al., 2013). The basis of this knowledge is often Indigenous Peoples’ long and profound relationships with the environment, that is, to the ecosystems, waters, ice, lands, territories and resources in their homelands. The relationships have been forged by adaptation to a particular environment and involve systematic activities. Indigenous harvesters, including hunters, fishers, agriculturalists and plant gatherers, observe and monitor environmental change, and engage in systematic reflection with one another about trends over short- and long-term periods (Sakakibara, 2010; Sánchez-Cortés and Chavero, 2011; Kermoal and Altamirano-Jiménez, 2016; Metcalfe et al., 2020b). The holistic perspective of the interrelated and interdependent nature of ecosystems is a distinct characteristic of IK and often contrasts with findings and results of science alone. Indigenous harvesters, agriculturalists, leaders, culture bearers, educators and government employees develop theoretical and practical knowledge of seasonal and climate change that seeks to furnish the best available knowledge and information to inform climate-change policy and decisions (Barrera-Bassols and Toledo, 2005; McNeeley and Shulski, 2011). Examples of theoretical knowledge systems include Indigenous calendars of seasonal change and systems of laws and protocols for environmental stewardship (see Box 14.1) (Kootenai Culture Committee, 2015; Donatuto et al., 2020)."

The right to self-determination, control over territorial development and cultural integrity make it important that climate scientists practise equitable engagement of IK and IK holders. There is a growing literature of success and lessons learned from co-production of knowledge between IK systems and diverse scientific traditions relating to climate change (Behe et al., 2018; Latulippe and Klenk, 2020; Camacho-Villa et al., 2021)."

These activities support a core economic base and an array of sustenance, including financial stability, food security, health and nutrition, safety, and adequate provisions and reserves of important supplies and resources, as well as the passing down of traditional knowledge. Indigenous lives and livelihoods are at risk in the following ways: Indigenous persons are more at risk of losing their lives due to factors that are exacerbated by climate-change impacts (Ford et al., 2006; Barbaras, 2014; Khalafzai et al., 2019). Indigenous Peoples’ livelihood practices are being distressed, interrupted and, in some cases, made entirely inaccessible. Livelihood activities known and anticipated to be impacted by climate change are food security (Meakin and Kurtvits, 2009; Wesche and Chan, 2010; Nyland et al., 2017), harvesting of fish, plants and wildlife (Dittmer, 2013; Parlee et al., 2014; Jantarasami et al., 2018b; ICC Alaska, 2020), agriculture (St Regis Mohawk Tribe, 2013; Shinbrot et al., 2019; Settee, 2020), transportation (Swinomish Indian Tribe Community, 2010; Hori et al., 2018a; Hori et al., 2018b), and tourism and recreation (ICC Canada, 2008).

Climate-change impacts and risks affect Indigenous Peoples’ health negatively in different ways. Indigenous health, as tied to nutrition and exercise, is threatened when local foods are less available and harvesting activities are less possible to practise (Norton-Smith et al., 2016b ; Rosol et al., 2016; Gonzalez et al., 2018).

Indigenous Peoples’ mental health is at risk and has already been affected negatively by climate change (Donatuto et al., 2021). Water security is one of the most serious concerns to Indigenous Peoples’ health and well-being (Vanderslice, 2011; Cozzetto et al., 2013a; Redsteer et al., 2013; Hanrahan et al., 2014; Chief et al., 2016; Gamble et al., 2016; Jantarasami et al., 2018b; Kloesel et al., 2018a; Tom et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2020a; Arsenault, 2021). When some people are less able to practise traditional, cultural, social and family activities, they can become alienated, compounding the negative effects of traumas Indigenous persons already experience. Traumas include historic and continuing land dispossession, assimilation, social marginalisation and discrimination, and food and financial insecurities. The practise of cultural traditions are associated with education, harvesting and agriculture, exercise, positive social relationships and family life, which play foundational roles in the achievement of physical, public and mental health (Bell et al., 2010; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2015; Jantarasami et al., 2018b; Norgaard and Tripp, 2019; Billiot et al., 2020b; Adams et al., 2021; Donatuto et al., 2021)."

Some Indigenous Peoples are facing climate-change impacts that generate community-led permanent relocation and resettlement as an adaptation option (Maldonado et al., 2021). Coastal erosion is one climate-change issue that is often connected to Indigenous Peoples planning to resettle, including vulnerability connected to higher sea levels and storm surges (Quinault Indian Nation, 2017; Bronen et al., 2018; Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, 2020). Adapting to new settlement areas threatens the continuity of communities. In a number of cases, Indigenous Peoples’ having less access to adequate infrastructure is a driver of vulnerability to climate-related disasters and extreme weather events (Doyle et al., 2018; Patrick, 2018; Cozzetto et al., 2021a; Indigenous Climate Action et al., 2021). Disasters and extreme events are particularly severe when their impacts are compounded by inadequate infrastructure. Lack of flood protection infrastructure on Indigenous reserve communities leads to displacement, loss of homes and perpetuates disproportionate levels of risk to extreme weather events (Cunsolo et al., 2020; Fayazi et al., 2020; Yellow Old Woman-Munro et al., 2021)."

Climate change is now creating additional challenges for Indigenous Peoples. For example, increased water scarcity due to higher temperatures and diminished precipitation have led to reduced crop yields for Maya farmers in Yucatan (Sioui, 2019). Thawing permafrost in subarctic Canada (Quinton et al., 2019) has interfered with the land-based livelihoods of the Indigenous Dene Peoples (CCP6)."
wg2_ch14_box-14.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Recent climate-related changes represent cultural threats similar to the ones that occurred when European settlement began in the Americas over 500 years ago (Whyte, 2016; Whyte, 2017). Thus, for Indigenous Peoples, who often disproportionately bear the impacts of climate change, such changes are not novel, but seen as déjà vu (Whyte, 2016). Since livelihoods and subsistence are often directly dependent on the land and water, Indigenous Peoples have direct insights into the localised impacts of global environmental change. Indeed, Indigenous Peoples consider themselves stewards of the land (and water), and have a spiritual duty to care for the land and its flora, fauna and aquatic community, or ‘Circle’ of beings. Indigenous knowledge (IK) has gained recognition for its potential to bolster Western scientific research about climate change. Many recent examples demonstrate the scientific value of IK for resource management in climate-change adaptation and mitigation (e.g., Kronik and Verner, 2010; Maldonado et al., 2013; Wildcat, 2013; Etchart, 2017; Nursey-Bray et al., 2019). For example, Indigenous practices have not only contributed to the present understanding of North American forest fires, but also that the practice of frequent small-scale anthropogenic fires, also called cultural burns, is a key method to prevent large-scale destructive fires (Section 14.7.1). The growing interest and recognised value in these practices, particularly in California, has led to formal agreements with state and federal agencies (Long et al., 2020a; Lake, 2021)."
wg2_ch14_box-14.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Indigenous relationships with the land are commonly informed and guided by a cultural ethic of ‘responsibility-based thinking’ (Sioui and McLeman, 2014). The Indigenous cultural ethic informs and mediates personal and collective conduct with a sense of duty or responsibility towards human and other-than-human relations (see Sioui, 2020). The Indigenous responsibility-based outlook stems from a cultural paradigm that understands that it is human beings who must learn to live  with the land (Cajete, 1999; Pierotti and Wildcat, 2000; McGregor et al., 2010a; McGregor, 2014). This way of thinking instils in its adherents an inherent awareness that the other-than-human realm is capable of existing and thriving without humans. Thus, it is for our own sake (as humans) that we learn to live according to certain ever-shifting parameters, requiring us to remain acutely attuned to our physical surroundings. This Indigenous cultural precept is perhaps among the most significant contributions of Indigenous Peoples to the rest of humanity in the face of climate change."
wg2_ch14_box-14.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Indigenous relationships with natural systems continue to be mediated by cultural orders of governance and legal systems that pre-date, by several millennia, European traditions in North America. Napolean (2012) describes Indigenous legal orders as dynamic and encompassing knowledge that is simultaneously legal, religious, philosophical, social and scientific. Customary Indigenous legal orders (e.g., Borrows, 2002; Napolean, 2012) stand in contrast to Eurocentric understandings of law, which are closely related to, and founded on, the Western principles of rights. Indigenous legal orders are based on duties, obligations and responsibilities to the land and all beings, including humans, animals, plants, future generations and the departed/ancestors (Borrows, 2002; Borrows, 2010a; Borrows, 2010b; Borrows, 2016). Indigenous spiritual laws are centred on the values of responsibility and accountability to the land, and how these differ, in theory and in practice, from Western law, which is based on ‘universal’ principles, with little consideration for the local environmental context (Craft, 2014). Research has elucidated these Indigenous understandings about how their land-based responsibilities act as the foundation of how humans must operate according to the land on which they live and depend."
wg2_ch14_box-14.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"With increasing climate-change threats to land-based subsistence and cultural practices, Indigenous Peoples are increasingly taking their rightful leadership roles in resource co-management arrangements and other stewardship activities (Section 14.5.2.2). Indeed, Indigenous Peoples are increasingly assuming leadership positions with regard to land governance and climate-change action, as the stewards of their traditional territories since time immemorial. Therefore, it is imperative for Indigenous scholars, Elders and knowledge holders to occupy leadership roles in climate-change adaptation and mitigation, especially when their territories are concerned (Section 14.7; CCP6). For instance, Indigenous ‘resurgence’ paradigms draw on the strengths of traditional land-based culture and knowledge with regard to Indigenous leadership in land governance and stewardship (Alfred and Corntassel, 2005; Alfred, 2009; Simpson, 2011; Corntassel and Bryce, 2012; Coulthard, 2014; Alfred, 2015). Indigenous leadership in climate-change policy, therefore, can ensure that Indigenous right to self-determination is respected and upheld to allow Indigenous Peoples to continue to carry out their cultural responsibilities to the land, for the benefit of all North Americans (Powless, 2012; Etchart, 2017)."

The Dehcho Collaborative on Permafrost  (DCoP) aims to improve the understanding of and ability to predict and adapt to permafrost thaw 3. 1 DCoP’s collaborative approach, which places Indigenous Peoples in leadership positions, generates the new knowledge, predictive capacity and decision-support tools to manage natural resources that support Indigenous Dene Peoples’ ways of life. Indigenous–academic partnerships can enhance climate-change adaptation and mitigation capacity, and provide openings for more holistic co-management approaches that recognise and affirm the central role of Indigenous Peoples as stewards of their ancestral territories, especially as they face accelerating climate-change impacts. Academic researchers and their Indigenous partners can support climate-change resilience via mobilising IK in stewardship and adaptation; researching governance arrangements, economic relationships and other factors that hinder Indigenous efforts in these areas; proposing evidence-based policy solutions at international and national scales; and outlining culturally relevant tools for assessing vulnerability and building capacity will also support climate-change resilience. Such IK underpins successful climate-change adaptation and mitigation (very high confidence) (see Green and Raygorodetsky, 2010; Kronik and Verner, 2010; Alexander et al., 2011; Powless, 2012; Ford et al., 2016; Nakashima et al., 2018).

Adapting to change, in all its forms, has since time immemorial been one of the defining characteristics of Indigenous cultures on Turtle Island (the American continent). In Yucatan, one Elder explained that with regards to climate-change impacts in the region, the Maya have always dealt with k’ech,  or change, and that accepting and responding to change is part of the Maya identity and responsibility (Sioui, 2020). Given successive failures in adequately and effectively responding to climate change, it has become urgent for the rest of the human collective to (re)learn from Indigenous cultures to (re)consider our responsibility/ies to the land—the world over—and to reorient our societal imperatives to better respond and react to change. Such a process of learning from IK could foster the development of climate-change policies that promote responsible and respectful relationships with the environment over the long term, and prove to be more effective and holistic. Although most inhabitants of North America are non-Indigenous, it is possible and beneficial for our societies to learn to think and act in a more responsibility-based way about our relations to the land, and, by extension, about climate-change policy. A collective commitment to protecting and advancing Indigenous territorial rights, so Indigenous Peoples can continue to reassert their spiritual duty and role as stewards of their traditional territories, benefits all human and other-than-human ‘Peoples’."

New applications of conventional strategies can be modified to achieve conservation goals under climate change (USGCRP, 2019). For example, mechanical thinning and prescribed burning (to reduce fuel loads and benefit ecosystems) could be used in combination with planting species better suited to new conditions to build resilience in western US forests to longer and hotter drought conditions (Bradford and Bell, 2017; Vernon et al., 2018). Protection of buffer areas, such as riparian strips in arid regions and boreal ecosystems, reduces water temperature, builds resistance to invasive species, increases suitable habitat (Johnson and Almlof, 2016) and facilitates protection of freshwater systems from runoff during and after intense rain events (National Research Council, 2002)."

Examples include translocation of salmon in the Columbia River (Holsman et al., 2012), genetic rescue (i.e., assisted gene flow increases genetic diversity to address local maladaptation) (Aitken and Whitlock, 2013) and locating and conserving climate refugia, such as in alpine meadows of the Sierra Nevada (Javeline et al., 2015; Morelli et al., 2016). Maintaining diverse spawning habitats and salmon runs can increase resilience of salmonid populations to climate change (Schoen et al., 2017; Crozier et al., 2021). Newer modelling approaches can facilitate the visualisation of future management scenarios, per a recent study of fires in the southwest USA (Loehman et al., 2018), in addition to technologies in genomics for monitoring species and modifying adaptive traits (Phelps, 2019)."

In contrast, ‘soft’ adaptation limits exist primarily as a function of the social–ecological value systems of local communities and government entities that are reflected as goals and objectives in their management plans for ecosystems and species across North America. Soft limits are often mutable or can be removed altogether (Dow et al., 2013).

Marine protected areas can attenuate climate impacts through trophic redundancy, preserving ecological processes, biodiversity and climate refugia (Roberts et al., 2017a; Schoen et al., 2017), although benefits decrease after mid-century (or sooner for high-latitude marine protected areas) as species reach their thermal limit, unless coupled with GHG mitigation (Bruno et al., 2018). Transport, relocation and cultivation of resistant breeds of salmon, oysters, corals, marine mammals and other keystone species, as well as hatchery supplementation of impaired populations of fish and shellfish, are species conservation and recovery methods that will be in greater demand under climate change, although unintended environmental impacts must be considered. Options for protecting and restoring coral reefs to prevent loss of ecosystem function are under development with Florida reef species (Gattuso et al., 2018; National Academies of Sciences, 2019).

Annual numbers of large wildland fires and area burned have risen in the past several decades in the western USA (USGCRP, 2017; USGCRP, 2018), and area burned has increased in Canada (although the number of large fires has declined slightly recently) (Gauthier et al., 2014; Natural Resources Canada, 2018; Hanes et al., 2019).

Decreased precipitation was the primary climate-change cause of increased burned area in the western USA, with warming a secondary influence (Holden et al. 2018), whereas warming (through aridity) was most important in a California study (Williams et al., 2019a). A drier atmosphere (including reduced precipitation) has been linked to climate change through altered large-scale atmospheric circulation, which then facilitated greater burned area in the western USA (Zhang et al., 2019c). Through anomalous warm and dry conditions, anthropogenic climate change contributed to the extreme fires of 2016 (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019 ; Tan et al., 2019) in western Canada and the extreme fire season in 2015 in Alaska (Partain et al., 2017).

There have been MHWs attributed to climate change in every marine system of North America including large areas of the Northwest Atlantic (2012), Caribbean Sea (2015), Bering Sea (2016–2018) and central through Northeast Pacific (2013–2016) (NOAA, 2018; Holbrook et al., 2019; Smale et al., 2019). Such MHW events have affected kelp forests (Arafeh-Dalmau et al., 2019), corals (Eakin et al., 2018), seagrasses, bottom-dwelling organisms, marine birds (Loredo et al., 2019; Smale et al., 2019), mammals (Suryan et al., 2021), fish and shellfish, and marine-dependent human communities (Huntington et al., 2020; Fisher et al., 2021; Suryan et al., 2021). Increased sea temperatures directly increase metabolic demand and change productivity and behaviour of fish species (Stock et al., 2017; Free et al., 2019) as well as induce rapid redistribution of species poleward and to deeper, colder waters (Pecl et al., 2017; Rheuban et al., 2017; Crozier et al., 2019; Stevenson and Lauth, 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Barbeaux et al., 2020; Cheung and Frölicher, 2020). In the Pacific, from the Baja Peninsula to the Bering Sea, there is evidence of widespread shifts in coastal biota and multi-trophic-level starvation of seabirds and whales from combined metabolic demand and reduced prey quality associated with protracted MHWs across multiple regions ((CCP6); Sydeman et al., 2015; Duffy-Anderson et al., 2019; Sanford et al., 2019; Smale et al., 2019; Suryan et al. 2021).

The MHW-induced loss of coral reefs across tropical North American waters has varied in severity regionally. For instance, in 2015 and 2016, extensive, severe bleaching affected more than 30% of corals off the southeast USA and a large proportion of US Hawaiian Islands, but had moderate to no impact off the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula (Frieler et al., 2013; Weijerman et al., 2015a; Weijerman et al., 2015b; Cinner et al., 2016; van Hooidonk et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2018; Sully et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019b). Some reefs are exhibiting recovery following efforts focused at reducing non-climate stressors (e.g., overfishing, nutrient pollution and tourism use). Such MHWs are increasing in intensity and frequency (Hobday et al., 2016; Smale et al., 2019) with the largest increases in frequency and spatial coverage projected for the Gulf of Mexico, US southern east coast and US Pacific Northwest (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) and pose a key risk to marine systems in North America (Section 14.5.2; Chapters 3, 16)."

Water allocation policies are being reassessed to enhance equity, sustainability and flexibility through shortage sharing agreements, improved groundwater regulation and voluntary water transfers. Developments include an interstate drought management agreement for the Colorado River (US Law, 2019), and agreements between the USA and Mexico to provide pulse flows to benefit the ecology of the Colorado River Delta (Pitt and Kendy, 2017).

Gaps in coverage and vaguely defined terms can lead to tensions and disputes, especially in areas facing increased aridity, creating difficulties for adaptation. For example, unregulated pumping of groundwater for irrigation during short-term droughts can serve as an adaptation to acute conditions (Section 14.5.4), but if persisting in the long term, it can deplete finite groundwater resources and de-water hydrologically connected rivers. Such outcomes have engendered bitter and costly interstate conflicts in the USA, some even reaching the US Supreme Court including Texas v. New Mexico (Rio Grande) and Florida v.

Adaptation planning may be hampered by conflicting interests, jurisdictional boundaries and inherent interconnections between actions and impacts at different points throughout a watershed or river basin. Differential power relationships, decision-making authority and access to information also can interfere with effective adaptive governance, while equitable processes for decision making bolstered by reliable shared information can help to overcome those impediments (Cosens et al., 2016; Arnold et al., 2017; Cosens et al., 2018; Porter and Birdi, 2018)."

For example, unregulated pumping of groundwater for irrigation during short-term droughts can serve as an adaptation to acute conditions (Section 14.5.4), but if persisting in the long term, it can deplete finite groundwater resources and de-water hydrologically connected rivers.

Adaptation planning may be hampered by conflicting interests, jurisdictional boundaries and inherent interconnections between actions and impacts at different points throughout a watershed or river basin. Differential power relationships, decision-making authority and access to information also can interfere with effective adaptive governance, while equitable processes for decision making bolstered by reliable shared information can help to overcome those impediments (Cosens et al., 2016; Arnold et al., 2017; Cosens et al., 2018; Porter and Birdi, 2018)."

Some crop loss events are partially attributed to climate change (high confidence) such as the 2012 Midwest and Great Plains drought, which cost agriculture 30 billion USD (Smith and Matthews, 2015; Rupp et al., 2017). Aridity is extending northward, altering crop suitability ranges (Figure 14.4); up to 50% of distributional shifts in growing regions for US crops between 1970 and 2010 may be related to climate change (Lant et al., 2016; Cho and McCarl, 2017).

Major electrical grid failure (i.e., blackouts) have increased across the USA and will continue to be particularly dangerous for human health when they coincide with extreme heat events (Stone et al., 2021).

Green infrastructure practices (e.g., open-space preservation, floodplain restoration, urban forestry, de-channelisation of streams) (see Box 14.7) can reduce urban flooding, erosion and harmful runoff (Kovacs et al., 2014; Angel et al., 2018b; Government of Canada, 2021c). Structural approaches have limitations and require trade-offs that could be addressed with a focus on social–ecological solutions and stronger institutional coordination (e.g., flood risk management in Mexico City) (Aragón-Durand, 2020). In response to high-intensity rainfall events, Mexico City invested in stormwater infrastructure, although additional benefits could have been realised if water supply needs had been incorporated (de Alba and Castillo, 2014). Some programmes exist to facilitate stormwater and wastewater infrastructure updating to accommodate increased precipitation across North America. The US federal Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides low-interest loans for states to upgrade infrastructure for climate change, with 42 billion USD provided since 1987 (ASCE, 2019). In Canada, local governments are important leaders in managing engineered and green infrastructure decisions, incentivising property-level flood protection and ensuring service delivery (Government of Canada, 2021c).

Structural approaches have limitations and require trade-offs that could be addressed with a focus on social–ecological solutions and stronger institutional coordination (e.g., flood risk management in Mexico City) (Aragón-Durand, 2020). In response to high-intensity rainfall events, Mexico City invested in stormwater infrastructure, although additional benefits could have been realised if water supply needs had been incorporated (de Alba and Castillo, 2014). Some programmes exist to facilitate stormwater and wastewater infrastructure updating to accommodate increased precipitation across North America. The US federal Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides low-interest loans for states to upgrade infrastructure for climate change, with 42 billion USD provided since 1987 (ASCE, 2019). In Canada, local governments are important leaders in managing engineered and green infrastructure decisions, incentivising property-level flood protection and ensuring service delivery (Government of Canada, 2021c).

It is important to differentiate between mortality related to cold temperatures and mortality due to other factors that vary with season (Ebi and Mills, 2013; Ebi, 2015). Warmer temperatures do not always equate to lower winter mortality: many cold-related deaths do not occur during the coldest times of year or in the coldest places (high confidence) but occur during the beginning or end of the winter season (Barnett et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2015; Sarofim et al., 2016b; Smith and Sheridan, 2019).

While mortality rates linked to direct cold exposure (e.g., hypothermia, falls and fractures) is generally low, the relatively higher mortality during milder temperatures is thought to be largely due to respiratory infections and cardiovascular impacts (Lee et al., 2014; Gasparrini et al., 2015), which, although correlated with temperature, may not be caused by cold temperatures (Ebi and Mills, 2013; Ebi, 2015; Sarofim et al., 2016a). When separating the effects of cold temperatures from the effects of the winter season, one study found that cold temperature did not drive mortality and suggested that winter season excess mortality was due to seasonal factors other than temperature (e.g., influenza, seasonal gatherings) (Kinney et al., 2015)."

It is important to differentiate between mortality related to cold temperatures and mortality due to other factors that vary with season (Ebi and Mills, 2013; Ebi, 2015). Warmer temperatures do not always equate to lower winter mortality: many cold-related deaths do not occur during the coldest times of year or in the coldest places (high confidence) but occur during the beginning or end of the winter season (Barnett et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2015; Sarofim et al., 2016b; Smith and Sheridan, 2019).

While mortality rates linked to direct cold exposure (e.g., hypothermia, falls and fractures) is generally low, the relatively higher mortality during milder temperatures is thought to be largely due to respiratory infections and cardiovascular impacts (Lee et al., 2014; Gasparrini et al., 2015), which, although correlated with temperature, may not be caused by cold temperatures (Ebi and Mills, 2013; Ebi, 2015; Sarofim et al., 2016a). When separating the effects of cold temperatures from the effects of the winter season, one study found that cold temperature did not drive mortality and suggested that winter season excess mortality was due to seasonal factors other than temperature (e.g., influenza, seasonal gatherings) (Kinney et al., 2015)."

The risk of a major accident or incident among Arctic-going yachts and some expedition passenger vessels is very high relative to other ships (high confidence) due to the combined increases in mobile ice, especially along the Northwest Passage (Barber et al., 2018a; Howell and Brady, 2019; Copland et al., 2021; Lemmen et al., 2021), limited regulation for private yachts (Dawson et al., 2014; Dawson et al., 2017), the propensity for cruise ships to travel into newly ice-free and poorly charted areas, and the increasing number of non-ice-strengthened vessels operating in the region (Dawson et al., 2018; Copland et al., 2019; Copland et al., 2021). Compounding risks include a lack of hydrographic charting and the lack of emergency response infrastructure (e.g., spill response, search and rescue, salvage) (Amap, 2017). Tourism demand for polar bear viewing in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, may change due to climate-related declines in polar bear health (Gil et al., 2015; Manuel-Navarrete and Pelling, 2015), but may be offset by ‘Last Chance Tourism’ (LCT), a niche tourism market of individuals who explicitly seek to visit vanishing landscapes and/or disappearing flora and fauna (Lemelin et al., 2010).

However, the cascading nature of climate impacts related to trade (see Box 14.5), labour productivity (Section 14.5.8.1.5) and infrastructure (Section 14.5.8.1.2) means that there is no economic sector in North America that will be unaffected by climate change (very high confidence) (Figure 14.10). For Canada, this assessment is further supported by the Canadian Climate Assessment (Lemmen et al., 2021). The combined economies of Canada, Mexico and the USA represented ~28% of the global GDP in 2019, with the USA accounting for almost 90% of the total activity for North America (World Bank, 2020  a). The risks posed at different global warming levels (GWLs) for any given economic activity or sector are presented in Figure 14.10. By combining expert judgement with a systematic review of the literature for each sector, the information in Figure 14.10 represents a broader synthesis, especially for sectors with a smaller literature base and at higher GWLs.

Low water levels in the Great Lakes has severely impacted US grain transport (Attavanich et al., 2013). High-intensity rain events destroyed 1000 km of roads and washed out hundreds of bridges and culverts in 2013 resulting in an estimated 6 billion CAD (considering the 2013 CAD value) in damages and recovery costs in Alberta, Canada (Palko and Lemmen, 2017). In 2019, the rail line from Winnipeg to Churchill Manitoba, which is the only ground transportation to the community and to Canada’s only deep-water Arctic port, was reopened after being closed for over 2 years due to the cumulative effects of flooding, permafrost degradation and political challenges (Lin et al., 2020).

The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire in Alberta, Canada, forced the evacuation of 88,000 people and the shutdown of mine operations. Damages were minimal because companies had undertaken proactive FireSmart interventions specifically developed for the industry (see Box 14.1; Council of Canadian Academies, 2019). Onshore oil field production in Tabasco, Mexico, which accounts for 16% of the country’s daily output, was interrupted by extensive flooding (Cruz and Krausmann, 2013). Two-thirds of mine operators globally, including major operators in North America, have experienced production challenges related to water shortages and flooding (Carbon Disclosure Project, 2013). Water availability stress due to climate change is lower in Canada than in the USA and Mexico, and mines in Canada may be less exposed to this risk (World Resourcs Institute, 2012) with some exceptions, that is, water-intensive oil sands mining in the Athabasca River basin in Canada (Section 14.5.3; Leong and Donner, 2016).Warming temperatures also have the potential to alter the nature, characteristics and quality of mineral resources such as kaolin or limestone (Phillips, 2016)."

Meeting existing and projected demand for water in affected regions could also require building new desalination plants. For example, Texas has constructed over 44 desalination plants across the state because of a lack of freshwater to meet potable water demand and due to climate-driven droughts (Kloesel et al., 2018b). Other infrastructure damaged by floods and SLR will need to be reassessed and perhaps relocated away from the coast. Relocation requires availability of land that frequently does not exist within urban areas (Lithogow, 2019). Some US tribes and Indigenous groups in Canada lack the financial resources to build climate-resilient infrastructure, such as housing and sewage treatment facilities, to assure clean drinking water (Martínez et al., 2014; Salgado and Luisa Martinez, 2017; Lithgow et al., 2019)."

General remoteness of many mining sites (especially in the North American Arctic) exacerbates risks related to emergency responses to extreme events such as wildfire (medium confidence). The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire in Alberta, Canada, forced the evacuation of 88,000 people and the shutdown of mine operations. Damages were minimal because companies had undertaken proactive FireSmart interventions specifically developed for the industry (see Box 14.1; Council of Canadian Academies, 2019). Onshore oil field production in Tabasco, Mexico, which accounts for 16% of the country’s daily output, was interrupted by extensive flooding (Cruz and Krausmann, 2013). Two-thirds of mine operators globally, including major operators in North America, have experienced production challenges related to water shortages and flooding (Carbon Disclosure Project, 2013). Water availability stress due to climate change is lower in Canada than in the USA and Mexico, and mines in Canada may be less exposed to this risk (World Resourcs Institute, 2012) with some exceptions, that is, water-intensive oil sands mining in the Athabasca River basin in Canada (Section 14.5.3; Leong and Donner, 2016).Warming temperatures also have the potential to alter the nature, characteristics and quality of mineral resources such as kaolin or limestone (Phillips, 2016)."

Risks are expected to be exacerbated as SLR and storm surge expands the risk zone for coastal flooding exposing more property to inundation and enhancing construction demand (see Box 14.4; Section 14.5.5.1.3; EPA, 2017). Meeting existing and projected demand for water in affected regions could also require building new desalination plants. For example, Texas has constructed over 44 desalination plants across the state because of a lack of freshwater to meet potable water demand and due to climate-driven droughts (Kloesel et al., 2018b). Other infrastructure damaged by floods and SLR will need to be reassessed and perhaps relocated away from the coast. Relocation requires availability of land that frequently does not exist within urban areas (Lithogow, 2019). Some US tribes and Indigenous groups in Canada lack the financial resources to build climate-resilient infrastructure, such as housing and sewage treatment facilities, to assure clean drinking water (Martínez et al., 2014; Salgado and Luisa Martinez, 2017; Lithgow et al., 2019)."

Schenker (2013) estimated that the climate impacts on trade from developing to developed countries could be responsible for 16.4% of the total expected cost of climate change in the USA in 2100 and, thus, North America would benefit from increased investment in effective and equitable trade policies and adaptation in developing regions. Under an RCP8.5 scenario (~2.6–4.8°C warming) and within current trade integration, climate change could lead to up to 55 million undernourished people by 2050. These projections decrease by 64% (20 million people) with the introduction of reduced trade tariffs and the lessening of institutional and infrastructure barriers (Janssens et al., 2020).

Existing power structures have also interacted with climate hazards to generate maladaptive outcomes (Quintana, 2013). Mennonite communities in the northern state of Chihuahua, Mexico, have pursued commercial agricultural markets that lead them to shift to transgenic crops and to overexploit local groundwater resources in a region experiencing multi-year droughts. These actions have led to conflict with other local farming groups with less economic capital to access groundwater (Quintana, 2013). Climate mitigation measures may also have adverse effects on local livelihoods with implications for adaptive capacity.

Existing power structures have also interacted with climate hazards to generate maladaptive outcomes (Quintana, 2013). Mennonite communities in the northern state of Chihuahua, Mexico, have pursued commercial agricultural markets that lead them to shift to transgenic crops and to overexploit local groundwater resources in a region experiencing multi-year droughts. These actions have led to conflict with other local farming groups with less economic capital to access groundwater (Quintana, 2013). Climate mitigation measures may also have adverse effects on local livelihoods with implications for adaptive capacity. The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) mitigation programme has been highlighted as a trade-off between an international/national carbon mitigation strategy and the ability of some Mexican rural communities to improve their food security (Section 5.6.3.3; Barbier, 2014)."

In the near term, where climate hazards influence out-migration, it will mostly augment existing patterns as migration is strongly influenced by existing social networks (Section 7.3.2). Planned relocation and resettlements will reduce the exposure to climate hazards for the involved populations but could adversely affect their livelihoods in the absence of supportive programmes (Section 7.3.2; Jantarasami et al., 2018a), since livelihood outcomes strongly depend on socioeconomic conditions."

Many actions that enhance and promote resilient livelihoods can have substantial benefit for adaptation to climate hazards (medium confidence). Livelihoods in the context of climate change are characterised by adjustments that then feed back into the assets that comprise a livelihood. Social capital–in the form of household and community cohesion–facilitates the development of adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in rural and urban communities at the household level and for small groups (Barbier, 2014; Nawrotzki et al., 2015b; Nawrotzki et al., 2015c). Cultural capital, especially in the form of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, can guide adaptation practices in North America (Akpinar Ferrand and Cecunjanin, 2014), preserving Indigenous cultures and enhancing future adaptation and resilience (see Box 14.1; Pearce et al., 2012; Audefroy and Cabrera Sánchez, 2017). In Mexico, rainwater harvesting (practised by some Mayan communities) and the use of local–traditional varieties of maize have assisted in the adaptation to climate impacts and promoted food security (Akpinar Ferrand and Cecunjanin, 2014; Hellin et al., 2014). Funding and support for these social adaptation strategies have been uneven (Barbier, 2014; Romeo-Lankao et al., 2014).

In the near term, actions that enhance in situ adaptive capacities as well as foster safe and orderly migration can result in synergies for both adaptation and development (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). Populations that experience less mobility or cannot engage in voluntary migration as an adaptation may need additional support to adapt to climate hazards, for example, northern communities that are at risk of climatic events (Hamilton et al., 2016). Policies associated with the transition from high-GHG intensive extractive industries, sometimes referred to as ‘just transitions’, may also support in situ livelihoods if they also aim to address and redress existing inequalities to reduce vulnerabilities (McCauley, 2018); however, these policies could result in maladaptation if they create new inequalities or generate other environmental damages."

Direct, indirect and non-market economic damages from extreme events have increased in some parts of North America (high confidence). The number of extreme events with inflation-adjusted damages totalling more than 1 billion USD has risen in the USA over the past decades (NOAA, 2020; Smith, 2020), and similar increases have been observed in Canada (Boyd and Markandya, 2021). Factors other than climate change, including increases in exposure and the value of the assets at risk, also explain increasing damage amounts (Freeman and Ashley, 2017; Vano et al., 2018). Climate change explains a portion of long-term increases in economic damages of hurricanes (limited evidence, low agreement ).  Studies of US hurricanes since 1900 have found increasing economic losses that are consistent with an influence from climate change (Estrada et al., 2015; Grinsted et al., 2019), although another study found no increase (Weinkle et al., 2018)."

Assuming a direct proportionality between attributable risk of the event to the attributable economic damages, one study suggested that 30–75% of the direct damages from Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change, with a best estimate of 67 billion USD out of an estimated 90 billion USD total of attributable damages (Frame et al., 2020). Another study modelled the component of the flooding from Hurricane Sandy due to rising SLR and mapped that to coastal damages. That study estimated that 8.1 billion USD (13% of the total) was attributable to the climate influence on SLR (Strauss et al., 2021)."

While the magnitudes of the estimates depend on approach and assumptions in the methods and expectations of future socioeconomic conditions, these studies show substantial projected economic damages across North America by the end of the century, especially for warming greater than 4°C (high evidence, high agreement ). Whether these damages translate into GDP effects is not clear for Canada. Some modelling approaches show modest GDP increases in 2050 and 2100, while others suggest modest decreases although it is anticipated that the economic effects for Canada will be large and negative (Boyd and Markandya, 2021). Large costs and risks, such as those associated with extreme events such as wildfires (Hope et al., 2016) and the increased need for infrastructure replacement (Neumann et al., 2015; Maxwell et al., 2018a), will have compounding effects in the markets by disrupting economic activities (see Box 14.5)."

No region in the USA is expected to avoid some level of adverse effects (medium evidence, high agreement ) (EPA, 2017; Martinich and Crimmins, 2019).

Cost–benefit analysis has also been applied to coordinating planning across jurisdictions in North America for SLR and flood control (Adeel et al., 2020). Adaptation costs in the USA are lower on RCP4.5 compared with RCP8.5 emission pathways (Martinich and Crimmins, 2019).

Harmonising SCC and consistent use can further enhance coordination of mitigation and adaptation decision making (Auffhammer, 2018; Aldy et al., 2021).

However, the implications for adaptation are unclear as soft adaptation limits are mutable and change with evolving knowledge, values, interests and perspectives involved in decision making (Adger et al., 2009; Moser et al., 2017). Hard limits have been identified for some natural systems, such as species extinctions (Sections 14.5.2.1, 14.5.1.3; Table 14.2)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation actions in one place or sector can have adverse side effects elsewhere (medium confidence). For example, increased use of groundwater for irrigation in response to aridification can reduce baseflows into rivers with adverse impacts on stream ecology and water availability for communities far downstream (Section 14.5.3). Additionally, across multiple sectors in North America, adaptation actions have tended to be sector specific rather than integrating across systems (Gao and Bryan, 2017; Fulton et al., 2019), despite the increasing awareness of cascading impacts and interdependencies (Zimmerman and Faris, 2010; C40 Cities and AECOM, 2017) and risks from possible ecological and social thresholds that have been identified under higher GWL (Section 14.6.3). For example, the water, energy and food nexus in North America has highlighted that food, water and energy security depend on transportation infrastructure (Section 14.5.8.1.2; Romero-Lankao et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"In response to some of the challenges presented in Section 14.7.2.1, substantial progress has been made in the North American context on the development of climate services, indicators, sustained assessments, and participatory and stakeholder-driven robust decision making (medium confidence) (Fazey et al., 2018; Fedele et al., 2019; Moss et al., 2019; Boon et al., 2021; Werners et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Decision making related to adaptation policies, plans and projects has become more formalised, emphasising participatory governance and co-production of knowledge. Canada has improved capacity with its Canadian Expert Panel on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Results and the recent National Adaptation Plan (Section 14.7.1.5), with the development of a series of indicators to measure progress on adaptation (EPCCAR, 2018; Government of Canada, 2021a). In the USA, indicators have been developed to communicate climate risks and guide adaptation efforts from federal (Kenney et al., 2020) to more regional initiatives (Kenney and Gerst, 2021). These climate indicators have been used to support user-driven assessments and to articulate adaptation goals (Moss et al., 2019; Kenney et al., 2020); however, these frameworks have not sufficiently incorporated monitoring and evaluation into adaptation plans (Lempert et al., 2018; Kenney et al., 2020). Tools and services to facilitate risk assessment and action planning have been made available through federal government climate service efforts, and guidance for their use has been developed (Vano et al., 2018); however, these products have been characterised as insufficiently developed to allow all adaptation practitioners to use these services (Meerow and Mitchell, 2017)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change and its projected impacts pose a substantial risk to North America as a region as well as to sectors, communities and individuals (Section 14.6.2). Incorporating different values and knowledge systems, consideration of equity and justice as core objectives and addressing underlying vulnerabilities are principles that can guide transformational adaptation and resilience (medium confidence)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Approaches that advance adaptation within the existing contexts (finances, institutions and processes) have been increasingly promoted by governments to mainstream climate risk into all considerations (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; Van der Brugge and Roosjen, 2015; Boon et al., 2021; Shi and Moser, 2021). Policies and programmes that build upon existing approaches that have inherent climate resilience including Indigenous knowledge-based land and resource management (Section 14.5.4), co-management of agriculture and freshwater resources (Section 14.5.3), NbS (see Box 14.7), links between health and equity, and ecosystem-based management (Sections 14.5.2–14.5.4) have advanced sustainable and equitable climate resilience. Implementing the recommendations in the ASCE committee’s report on adaptation to a changing climate (2018a) and Canada’s Infrastructure and Buildings Working Group report has been identified as an opportunity to improve social equity by ensuring the resilience of infrastructure and the services it provides, through adoption of standards and good asset management practices (Amec Foster Wheeler Environment and Infrastructure, 2017; ASCE, 2018a)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Long-term policy signals to incentivise ongoing, scalable adaptation action that is coordinated with mitigation efforts will increase actions and prevent potential maladaptive investment (Moser, 2018; Shi and Moser 2021). Using SDG goals and the NDCs as a framework for inclusive and coordinated partnership and vertical integration across subnational, national and regional planning can promote climate resilient development (CRD) (Section 18.1.3). Coordination of policies and responses have been identified as supporting longer-term, transformational adaptation and minimising risk (Termeer et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018). New approaches for enabling and incentivising transformative adaptation in North America are rapidly emerging (Colloff et al. 2017; Fedel et al. 2019; Werners et al. 2021). Evaluation of the feasibility of evolving adaptation strategies is only in the early stages, but recent work has provided the foundation for assessing these considerations (Table 14.7; Chapter 16)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Differing values, perspectives, interests and needs of relevant actors (Dittrich et al., 2016) through participatory processes, such as co-production of knowledge (Meadow et al., 2015; Wall et al., 2017), have been incorporated through the Resilience Dialogues 2117  and the development of guidance on climate scenarios (Chaumont, 2014). Framing of adaptation goals strongly determines beneficiaries of resultant policies and underscores the importance of a plurality of perspectives in adaptation governance (Cochran et al., 2013; Plummer, 2013; Allison and Bassett, 2015; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018). Sustained engagement through iterative knowledge development, learning and negotiation has been identified as core for addressing climate risks (Kates et al., 2012; Seijger et al., 2014). Interdisciplinary and inclusive adaptation programmes that embrace and plan for conflict and resolution, and address inequalities, have been part of broadening the opportunities for engagement (Cantú, 2016; Termeer et al., 2017; Parlee and Wiber, 2018; Sterner et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Equity and justice in climate adaptation have been identified as providing a foundation for resilience in natural, social and built systems (Cochran et al., 2013; Reckien et al., 2017; Schell et al., 2020). This approach recognises that social vulnerability undermines efforts to increase adaptive capacity and that adaptation may also entrench existing social inequities, such as marginalisation of communities of colour, gender discrimination, legacy effects of colonisation and gentrification of coastal communities (Schell et al., 2020; Thomas, 2020). Thus, identifying systemic racism and the effects of colonialism within and across institutions has also been identified as part of achieving more just and equitable adaptation (Shi and Moser 2021). Acknowledgement and incorporation of IK in adaptation planning and implementation also recognises Indigenous sovereignty issues and the importance of the equitable role of Indigenous self-determination in governance and planning (see Box 14.1; Section 14.4; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Strategies have been emerging to facilitate progress by including specific guidance on tools for financing and funding climate-change adaptation infrastructure (Berry and Danielson, 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Zerbe, 2019). This includes facilitating transitions between incremental and transformational efforts to facilitate CRD (Figure 14.12; Chapter 18)."
wg2_ch14_14.7.2.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"The extent to which resilient infrastructure contributes to social justice and equity has also been taken into consideration (Climate-Safe Infrastructure Working Group, 2018; Doorn, 2019). Proactive actions focused on small towns and rural areas—including the interdependencies between cities and surrounding areas—increases the potential that small and medium cities can build adaptive capacity at a pace that is commensurate with present and future risks (Moss et al., 2019; Vodden and Cunsolo, 2021). This coordination also creates greater opportunity for translation of knowledge into practice and assessing knowledge in the context that it is to be applied to improve decision making across scales (Enquist et al., 2017; Moss et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch14_box-14.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are ‘actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits’ (IUCN, 2016). Such NbS in the context of climate change, or nature-based adaptation see (Box 1.3), can jointly address multiple social–ecological issues related to climate-change hazards, impacts, adaptation and mitigation (Figure Box 14.7.1; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2). Successful nature-based adaptation draws from existing adaptation approaches (Borsje et al., 2011; Temmerman et al., 2013; Law et al., 2018; Reguero et al., 2018; Buotte et al., 2019) and is applied across ecological and human systems (high confidence) (Table Box 14.7.1; Figure Box 14.7.1)."
wg2_ch14_box-14.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Innovative approaches in Canada (Borsje et al., 2011; Spalding et al., 2014; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020) and the USA (Law et al., 2018; Buotte et al., 2019; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020) have led to social and environmental co-benefits and could address both future climate risk and long-standing social injustices (Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Schell et al., 2020; Cousins, 2021). Effective nature-based adaptation requires a well-coordinated suite of adaptation efforts (e.g., assessment, planning, funding, implementation and evaluation) that is co-produced among stakeholders and across sectors (high confidence) (Millar and Stephenson, 2015; Kabisch et al., 2016; Dilling et al., 2019; Morecroft et al., 2019; Lavorel et al., 2020). Evaluating the efficacy of nature-based adaptation may become more tractable with more uniform guidelines for implementation (Scarano, 2017; Malhi et al., 2020; Seddon et al., 2020), and coordination in scaling-up local-level nature-based adaptation measures is likely to facilitate long-term success (Gao and Bryan, 2017)."
