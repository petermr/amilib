wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Cities and urbanising areas are currently home to over half the world’s population. What happens in cities is crucial to successful adaptation (Grafakos  et al., 2019). By 2050, over two thirds of the world’s population is expected to be urban, many living in unplanned and informal settlements and in smaller urban centres in Africa and Asia (high confidence) (UNDESA, 2018). Between 2015 and 2020, urban populations globally have grown by about 397 million people, with more than 90% of this growth taking place in less developed countries (UNDESA, 2018). Projections of the number of people expected to live in urban areas highly exposed to climate change impacts have also increased, exacerbating future risks under a range of climate scenarios. Rates of population growth are most pronounced in smaller and medium-sized settlements of up to 1 million people (UNDESA, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there has been increasing understanding of the interdependence of meta-regions, large, small and rural settlements which may be connected through key infrastructure (Lichter and Ziliak, 2017), including national and trans-national infrastructure investments (Hanakata and Gasco, 2018). Almost all the world’s non-urban population and its provisioning ecosystems are impacted by urban systems through connecting infrastructure and family and kinship ties, remittances and trade arrangements that influence flows of water, food, fibre, energy, waste and people (Trundle, 2020; McIntyre-Mills and Wirawan, 2018; Zhang  et al., 2019; Nerini  et al., 2019; Friend and Thinphanga, 2018). Many rural places are so deeply connected to urban systems that risks are observed to cascade from one to the other, for example, when drought in arable zones leads to food insecurity in cities, or where flood damage to urban transport infrastructure leads to prolonged isolation of small towns and rural settlements (Friend and Thinphanga, 2018; McIntyre-Mills and Wirawan, 2018). A focus of this chapter is the experience of a range of urban settlements, from small to large, and the connecting infrastructure and formal and informal networks and systems that join them to each other. There are close synergies with Chapters 7 (Health, Well-being and the Changing Structure of Communities) and 8 (Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development). There are further important synergies with Working Group III Chapter 8 (Urban Systems and Other Settlements) and the Cross-Chapter Paper 2: Cities and Settlements by the Sea."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Well-planned climate adaptation can have far reaching co-benefits for sustainable development and community well-being (Nerini  et al., 2019; Tonmoy  et al., 2020). However, the varied success of cities’ responses to the global COVID-19 pandemic underscores how social and economic conditions, built environments and local planning can exacerbate or reduce vulnerability and long-term sustainable, community well-being (Megahed and Ghoneim, 2020; Plastrik  et al., 2020; Hepburn  et al., 2020; Sarkis  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Many of the significant sustainable development initiatives that have been proposed and implemented in the last five years recognise the critical importance of cities, settlements and key infrastructure in responding to the crisis of climate change (Zhang  et al., 2019; Nerini  et al., 2019). There is widespread acceptance of the need for far-reaching responses by actors from the local to the global scales to make human settlements and infrastructure more resilient (UNDP, 2021). There is recognition also of the considerable capacity in settlements to meet climate change challenges, if the governance, financial and social conditions are in place (Carter  et al., 2015; MINURVI, 2016). And yet the implementation of climate adaptation planning lags behind climate mitigation efforts in urban communities (Sharifi, 2020; Grafakos  et al., 2019; Nagendra  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Since the publication of AR5, there has been rapid expansion in policy, practice and research related to climate change and human settlements. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the SDGs) agreed in September 2015, was preceded by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-30 and followed shortly afterwards by the Paris Agreement (December 2015) (United Nations, 2015b). These make explicit mention of ‘mainstreaming of disaster risk assessments into land use policy development and implementation, including urban planning’ (Sendai Framework) (UNISDR, 2015). The agreements identify ‘sustainable cities and communities’ (SDG11) and ‘cities and subnational authorities’ (Paris Agreement) as important actors in integrating climate and development goals (Sanchez Rodriguez, Ürge-Vorsatz and Barau, 2018). However not all urban SDGs have measurable targets yet, or data, particularly in regard to children and youth, the elderly and disabled (Klopp and Petretta, 2017; Reckien  et al., 2017; Nissen  et al., 2020). Clear procedures for linking climate adaptation in communities at all scales to the SDGs is lacking (Major, Lehmann and Fitton, 2018; Sanchez Rodriguez, Ürge-Vorsatz and Barau, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The New Urban Agenda (NUA) (October 2016), with its focus on housing and sustainable urban development, commits its signatories to building resilient and responsive cities that foster climate change mitigation and adaptation (United Nations, 2016b). This agreement followed the Geneva UN Charter on Sustainable Housing, endorsed by 56 member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (United Nations, 2015d). The NUA aims to ensure access to decent, adequate, affordable and healthy housing for all, while reducing the impact of the housing sector on the environment and increasing resilience to extreme weather events (United Nations, 2016b). Voluntary, networked action led by cities was also illustrated by a November 2019 call to Mayors and youth climate activists to sign a voluntary pledge in a ‘Race to Zero’ ahead of the Conference of the Parties 26, which included endorsing principles of a New Green Deal (C40, 2019). Other voluntary, global, urban efforts have been led by the scientific community including the Research and Action Agenda on Cities and Climate Change Science which aims to promote research and reports (Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"These collaborative global changes are reflected in the bodies of literature assessed for this report. In AR5, the section on ‘human settlements, industry, and infrastructure’ contained three chapters: urban areas; rural areas; and key economic sectors and services. This chapter covers the full range of human settlements: from small settlements in predominantly rural areas, to large metropolises in both high-income and low-income countries. It also assesses evidence of climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation on a range of urban infrastructures, including infrastructure that incorporates socio-economic and ecosystem dimensions (see Section 6.1.3)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"This assessment also considers new literature about how enabling environments can support adaptation in ways that are also sensitive to Indigenous knowledge and Local knowledge (see below Section 6.1), social justice (6.4.3.4)) and climate mitigation (Section 6.3.5.2). It builds on the findings of AR5 which highlighted the concentration of global climate risks in urban areas, the complex causal chains that mediate climate impacts for smaller settlements and rural areas, and the multiple issues shaping and influencing economic sectors and infrastructure. This integrated chapter enables a more detailed analysis of the inter-connected drivers of risk that affect urban people and settlements of different sizes. This discussion also highlights the inter-connections within and between urban areas, and between different types of infrastructure and how these complex relationships accentuate or limit the effects of climate change and the institutional structures that play a critical role in mediating and govern these relationships."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"This chapter has five main sections. The first elaborates on changes in the international policy context since 2014, highlighting the implications that this has for responses to climate change in cities, settlements and key infrastructure. Section 6.2 is focused on observed and projected climate risks, paying particular attention to the ways in which these are created through processes of urbanisation and infrastructural investment. Section 6.3 takes an integrated and holistic approach to an assessment of adaptive actions relevant to key infrastructures (those that form the material basis for resilience in cities and settlements, drive economies and are essential for human well-being). Section 6.4 assesses the enabling conditions and leadership qualities associated with adaptation processes that can also meet the equity agenda of the SDGs, to leave no-one behind, including the role of governance, finance, institutions and emerging literature around the limits of urban adaptation."
wg2_ch06_6.1.1_p10,NO_TITLE,Case studies highlight how climate and other issues interrelate to create (or reduce) urban risk within and between scales of decision making. They illustrate how multiple levels of governance and formal and informal decision making sectors influence how risk production/reduction plays out across a range of urban contexts and networks.
wg2_ch06_6.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The AR5 conceptualised cities and settlements as complex interdependent systems that could be engaged in supporting climate change adaptation (Revi  et al., 2014 8.8.2). Effective municipal governance systems and cooperative multi-level governance supported adaptation action. The AR5 report expressed medium confidence that governance interventions can help develop synergies across geographical and institutional scales. Urban areas face challenges of infrastructure investment and maintenance, land use management, livelihood creation and ecosystem services protection. AR5 also considered how urban localities can encourage incremental and transformative adaptation, build resilience and support sustainable development. The assessment identified the need for multi-level and multi-partner action in rapidly growing cities where institutions and infrastructure are still not established to meet the growing demands of the cities. However, there was only medium confidence that adaptation action was happening in the AR5 review period."
wg2_ch06_6.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The framing of ‘key economic sectors and services’ in AR5 focused primarily on three infrastructural areas (energy, water services, transport) and on primary and secondary economic activities (including recreation and tourism, insurance and financial services). Cities, settlements and key infrastructure are also referred to in the IPCC special reports released since AR5. The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018) examines impacts of global warming on urban systems and infrastructure in the context of advancing sustainable development and eradicating poverty. It highlights the risks facing residents of unplanned and informal urban settlements, many of which are exposed to a range of climate-related hazards (Sections 3.4.8 and 4.4.1.3). The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C also identifies green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water management as key adaptation options that can reduce risks in urban areas (SPM C2.4; C2.5), and highlights ‘urban and infrastructure’ as one of four system transitions required to limit warming to 1.5°C to create an enabling environment for adaptation (Section 4.3.3). Innovative governance arrangements that go beyond formal ‘government’ and political arrangements and that include non-state actors, networks and informal institutions were identified as important in addressing climate change and implementing responses to 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C [Sections 4.4.1 and 5.6.2]). In addition, the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C mentions, with high confidence, the climate-related health effects of urban heat islands, urban heatwaves and increasing risks from some vector-borne diseases (illnesses caused by pathogens and parasites in human populations) (SPM B5.2). The report also notes both trade-offs and important co-benefits of sustainable development in pursuit of climate resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (SPM D6)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere (SROCC) similarly emphasizes the role governance plays in reducing disaster risk, through planning, and zoning (IPCC, 2019b). It identifies vulnerability factors such as poverty, which can undermine resilience and sustainable development in urban communities (IPCC, 2019b SPM C3.1,and Section 2.3.2) The SROCC report shows that the emerging climate-related challenges are impacting the accessibility and availability of vital resources and blurring the public and private boundaries of risk and responsibility (Cross-Chapter Box 3). According to the SROCC report, new governance arrangements are emerging to address these challenges, including participatory and networked structures, and institutions linking formal and informal networks involving state, private sector, Indigenous and civil society actors (Cross-Chapter Box 3). The SROCC report calls for place-specific action because there is no single climate governance panacea for the ocean, coasts and cryosphere (Cross-Chapter Box 3). The SROCC report highlights evidence of the importance of inclusivity, fairness, deliberation, reflexivity, responsiveness, social learning, the co-production of knowledge, and respect for ethical and cultural diversity in climate-related urban decision making (Cross-Chapter Box 3). In addition, the Special Report on Climate Change and Land notes that urbanisation can intensify extreme rainfall events over the city or downwind of urban areas and have can significant consequences for heat island effects on loss of food production, posing additional risks to the food system (IPCC, 2019b SPM A5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"An additional research bridge between AR5 and AR6 was the IPCC Cities and Climate Change Science conference held in Edmonton, Canada, in March 2018 (Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019). This generated a ‘Global Research and Action Agenda on Cities and Climate Change Science’ (Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019), which highlights six topical research areas where more evidence is needed to inform action: finance; informality; uncertainty; urban planning and design; built and green/blue infrastructure; and sustainable consumption and production. These areas are addressed in specific sections of this chapter or as cross-cutting themes. The Cross-Working Group Box URBAN in this chapter provides a linkage with perspectives from Working Group III."
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,This chapter covers both ‘cities and settlements’ and ‘key infrastructure’.
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Definitions of ‘urban’ have become more nuanced since the AR5 review with the publication of the OECD report ‘A new perspective on urbanisation’ (OECD and European Commission, 2020). This report presents two new global definitions of urbanisation reflecting the degree of urbanisation on a continuum of cities, towns and semi-dense areas, and rural areas. The OECD estimates almost half the world’s population (48%) live in cities, while just 24% live in rural areas and 28% live in towns and semi-dense areas (28%). In addition, the OECD report defines metropolitan areas as functional urban areas together with their surrounding commuting zones ‘to capture the full extent’ of a city’s working population. Metropolitan areas account for 54% of total world population, with the OECD estimating that commuting zones representing 17% of the overall metropolitan population, rising to 31% in high-income countries. In the context of these global definitions, this chapter identifies ‘cities and settlements’ as concentrated human habitation centres (along a dynamic continuum from rural to urban) (Murali  et al., 2019; Ward and Shackleton, 2016) (Figure 6.1) that are fundamentally inter-connected to other urban centres and rural areas as nodes within broader networks."
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Key infrastructure is used here to refer to ‘critical nodes and arteries’ that comprise urban energy, food, water, sewerage, health, transport and communication systems (Steele and Legacy, 2017; Maxwell  et al., 2018; Bassolas  et al., 2019). Key or critical infrastructure provides much of the material basis of cities and settlements, as well as the mechanisms for enabling flows of people, goods, data, waste, energy (through urban metabolism processes of consumption and production) and capital, between urban regions and rural areas (Blay-Palmer  et al., 2018; Dijst  et al., 2018). An overview of this process of ‘planetary’ urbanisation is provided in Box 6.1. The balance of accumulated scientific knowledge on climate risks, impact and adaptation has been generated from studies in large and medium-sized cities of 1 million or more. While these larger cities continue to grow rapidly (UNDESA 2018), settlements of more than 5 million people contain less than a quarter of the world’s urban population, and more than half of the world’s urban residents live in settlements of 1 million or less (Table 6.1). There is a key gap in knowledge, especially concerning urban enabling environments and how smaller settlements can be supported to accelerate equitable and sustainable adaptation in the face of financial and governance constraints (Birkmann  et al., 2016; Shi  et al., 2016; Dulal, 2019; Rosenzweig  et al., 2018b)."

wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"This chapter takes a comprehensive approach to understanding ‘key infrastructure’ as expressed in social, nature-based and physical infrastructure. Social infrastructure includes the social, cultural, and financial activities and institutions, as well as associated property, buildings and artefacts and policy domains such as social protection, health and education that support well-being and public life (Frolova  et al., 2016; Latham and Layton, 2019). Nature-based infrastructure focuses on solutions to risk, applying natural assets such as trees or open water, physical infrastructure describes engineering approaches and grey/physical infrastructure refers to engineered assets that provide one or multiple services required by society, such as transportation or wastewater treatment ([IISD, N.D.]; see also Annex II: Glossary)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"This approach is based on a framing of cities and settlements as complex systems where social, ecological and physical processes interact in planned and unplanned ways. This chapter therefore builds on the AR5 Chapter 10 (Arent et al., 2014) conception of key economic sectors and services (e.g., energy, water, transport, waste, sanitation and drainage) by positioning these within three major categories of infrastructure: social, nature based and physical (see Section 6.3). Where adaptation challenges can be responded to by more than one approach, sometimes working together, this is noted (see also Sections 17.2 and 17.4). This approach allows an understanding of adaptation that is not constrained to the administrative boundaries of cities and settlements, but that includes the networks and flows that connect peri-urban communities, metropolitan regions, suburban settlements and more rural places (see Box 6.1). Both formal provision of infrastructure services by government and informal provision by communities and individuals are considered at risk from climate change, as are existing adaptation pathways and actions."
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Cities are complex entities where social, ecological and physical systems interact in planned and unplanned ways (Markolf  et al., 2018). The complexity of cities, settlements and key infrastructure (Figure 6.2) where multiple functional systems continuously interact makes it difficult to distinguish risks (Box 6.1). The literature often resolves this by offering discrete assessments for specific sectors (see Section 6.3). This fragmented approach to understanding climate change associated impacts and risks is then reflected also in siloed approaches to risk management and adaptation financing (see Section 6.4). Recent literature notes that resilience planning has begun to overcome this tendency by presenting climate change impacts, losses and damages, and urban processes, as unfolding together in interacting and cascading pathways (Fraser  et al., 2020; Eriksen  et al., 2020) (Figure 6.2). The chapter reflects this change in the literature by presenting climate change impacts through a series of risk assessments, including by hazard type, through indirect impacts on health or food security, key infrastructure systems, land use and human mobility, water flows and on structural conditions, such as poverty and justice in the city (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). In a departure from AR5 we also consider the consequential interactions of climate risks, impacts, adaptation and climate mitigation (see also Cross-Working Group Box URBAN in Chapter 6)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p11,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC 1.5°C Special Report commented that ‘The extent of risk depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness of adaptation for regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal settlements, and infrastructure sectors (energy, water, and transport) (high confidence)’ (IPCC, 2018).We take this statement as a starting point for assessing the risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure, with infrastructure extended as noted above. Risks from climate change are understood as the product of climate change associated hazards impacting on exposed and vulnerable people and assets (including biodiversity). Adaptation can, in some cases, reduce exposure and susceptibility and enable recovery and scope for transformation toward long-term equitable and sustainable development. Risks describe both present conditions and future prospects. Direct attribution of hazards to climate change remains limited to temperature extremes and sea level rise, though we consider all hydrometeorological hazards as systems associated with climate change processes."
wg2_ch06_6.1.3_p12,NO_TITLE,"This chapter also assesses conditions supporting incremental and transformative adaptation (Section 6.4). Incremental and transformative adaptation are both important but serve distinct roles in the interaction of urban systems, climate risk and risk management, and in advancing social justice, just transitions and climate resilient development (see Section 6.4). Climate resilient development pathways are an emerging concept in the literature since the AR5 (Schipper  et al., 2020). Climate resilient development is an iterative process of systemic change that integrates both mitigation and adaptation efforts (see Annex II: Glossary). Initial studies highlight the way rapid urbanisation and precarious urban housing and land tenure can undermine climate resilient development, while human settlements that are managed to protect housing tenancy and land tenure rights can advance land use planning and social learning while reducing inequalities and vulnerability and enhancing resilient development (Mitchell, Enemark and Van der Molen, 2015; Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2018). The benefits of integrating decision making across scales for climate resilient development is also highlighted in Section 6.4. How households engage with communities and neighbourhoods and larger units within cities, and how cities (both formal and informal) interact with sub-national and national actors is also discussed, as is the role of finance and community-based organisations (CBOs)/NGOs in the governance process."
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, many cities and other settlements, particularly unplanned and/or informal in Asia and Africa, have continued to grow at rapid rates (van den Berg , Otto and Fikresilassie 2021). Elsewhere, in Latin America in particular, while growth is less rapid, inequality persists. As a result, cities and settlements are crucial both as sites of potential action on climate change, and sites of increased exposure to risk (medium evidence, high agreement ). "
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Patterns and trends for urban population growth were described in detail in AR5. Between 2015 and 2020, urban populations globally have grown by more than 397 million people, with more than 90% of this growth taking place in less developed regions (UNDESA, 2018). The latest population projections from UNDESA (2018) reinforce the trends identified previously, with even higher estimates for global urban populations. The 2012 data used in AR5 projected a global urban population of 4984 million in 2030 and 6252 million in 2050; the 2018 revisions project 5167 million and 6680 million respectively. Particularly noteworthy is the higher projection provided for sub-Saharan Africa’s urban population: increasing from 596 million to 666 million in 2030, and from 1069 million to 1258 million in 2050. These figures highlight the continued trend toward larger urban populations, and the particular significance of this in areas which currently have relatively small proportions of their populations living in towns and cities; this is also true in some Small Island States (e.g., the Solomon Islands) (McEvoy  et al., 2020). The proportion of the global urban population living in megacities (with populations of more than 10 million people) is expected to continue growing slowly (to 16% of the urban total, or 862 million people, living in 48 agglomerations) by 2035 (UNDESA, 2018). The size and form of these megacities presents particular challenges with climate change impacts, in areas including air quality (Baklanov, Luisa and Molina, 2016), flooding (Januriyadi  et al., 2018), and temperature increase (Darmanto  et al., 2019) (see Section 6.2.3)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"While there are few analyses of urban trends at the global scale, an additional 2.5 billion people are projected to be living in urban areas by 2050, with up to 90% of this increase concentrated in the regions of Asia and Africa, particularly in India, China and Nigeria, where 35% of this urban growth is projected to occur (UNDESA, 2018). Growth rates are slowing down in North America, South America and Europe (UNDESA, 2018). Much global growth continues to outstrip the ability of governments or the private sector to plan, fund and provide for sustainable urban infrastructure and this is most marked in low-income and informal settlements (Angel  et al., 2016). Rural migration as a driver of urbanisation is discussed in 6.2.4.3, and literature has documented the way urban expansion and the conversion of agricultural land is also driven by investment incentives and weak planning policies (Colsaet, Laurans and Levrel, 2018; Woodworth and Wallace, 2017). At the same time, early evidence suggests that, at least in some locations, out-migration from cities occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Rajan, Sivakumar and Srinivasan, 2020), but the evidence is not clear and in some cases may have increased migration to other megacities (Chow  et al., 2021). There is also growing recognition that poor planning has exacerbated the concentrated of deprivation in specific locations, deepening a cycle of exclusion and marginalisation (UNDESA, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"One critical element of global urban trends which has received growing attention is informality (see also Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019). Informality is one of the key defining features of cities and settlements in the Global South (see Annex II: Glossary; Banks, Lombard and Mitlin, 2020; Myers, 2021; UN-Habitat, 2016c). In almost all nations in the Global South, more than half the urban workforce work in informal employment; the proportions are particularly high in South Asia (82% in informal employment) and sub-Saharan Africa (66%) (Chen, Roever and Skinner, 2016; Chen, 2014). The term ‘informal settlement’ refers to urban settlements or neighbourhoods that developed outside the formal system that is meant to record land ownership and tenure and without meeting a range of regulations relating to planning and land use, built structures and health and safety. Informality is a broader concept than ‘slums’, which are usually defined using measures of housing quality, provision of services and overcrowding. While most countries do not generate formal statistics on the number of people living in informal settlements, UN Habitat provides regional and global estimates of the number of urban households that are ‘slum’ households and therefore likely to include most residents of informal settlements. These estimates suggest that there were 1034 million slum dwellers in 2018, including some 56% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa and more than 30% of the urban population of South Asia (UN-Habitat, 2020). Informality is particularly important in understanding climate risks and responses in cities and settlements, and also in relation to key infrastructure (Trundle, 2020; Taylor  et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Evidence since AR5 confirms that occupants of informal settlements are particularly exposed to climate events given low-quality housing, limited capacity to adapt, and limited or no risk-reducing infrastructure (high confidence) (Melore and Nel, 2020; Twinomuhangi  et al., 2021; Satterthwaite  et al., 2020; Patel  et al., 2020a)(see Section 6.2 and case study). The impacts of COVID-19 are also increasingly impacting high-density informal and slum settlements where social distancing and access to water for handwashing are limited (Bhide, 2020; Pinchoff  et al., 2021; Tagliacozzo, Pisacane and Kilkey, 2021; Wilkinson, 2020). This compounds pre-existing vulnerability to climate change associated hazards. Box 6.1 expands on trends in informality as part of global urbanism, peri-urbanisation and suburbanisation, with implications for the global distribution of climate risks and adaptive capacity."
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation and related concepts of urban climate resilience are also concerns for the broader agenda of sustainable development (Wachsmuth, Cohen and Angelo, 2016). Urban areas can play a positive role in advancing sustainability, but the pace and scale of urban development can also undermine progress in SDGs (Barnett and Parnell, 2016; Maes  et al., 2019; Anarfi, Hill and Shiel, 2020) (high confidence). With careful planning, urbanisation can be a transformative force, enhancing equity and well-being through co-benefits and synergies between climate change adaptation, equitable urban development and mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Parnell, 2016a; Solecki  et al., 2015; Sharifi, 2020). Cities can be effective change agents when supported by networked local and national institutions, including professional bodies (high confidence) (Andonova, Hale and Roger, 2017; Brandtner and Suárez, 2021; Heidrich  et al., 2016; Kern, 2019; Farzaneh and Wang, 2020). Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) have developed effective science–policy interactions to support energy-system, environmental and economic development planning strategies in the city of Shanghai, China (Farzaneh and Wang, 2020). New literature is emerging about how adaptive changes at the urban level could integrate both far reaching rapid emission reduction and community protection in transformative ways (Wamsler and Raggers, 2018; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018; UN-Habitat, 2020; Ziervogel, 2019a). There is an increasing consensus about the need for integrated governance of urban areas within and across regions, so that urban risk management and adaptation happen hand in hand with more general processes of transition toward more sustainable urban regions (Simon, 2016; UN-Habitat, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.1.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there has also been increasing recognition of the contribution of diverse knowledges including local and Indigenous knowledge in contributing to the development and interpretation of urban relevant climate change data and policy for effective action (Klenk  et al., 2017; Hosen, Nakamura and Hamzah, 2020; Makondo and Thomas, 2018). Indigenous and local knowledge inform coping strategies in urban adaptation planning and new directions for action (Nakashima, Krupnik and Rubis, 2018; Abudu Kasei, Dalitso Kalanda-Joshua and Tutu Benefor, 2019). Indigenous and local knowledge is also found to shape perceptions about urban climate risk awareness, its acceptable limits, causation and preferences for adaptation (see also Pyhälä et al., 2016 for a review; see Jaakkola, Juntunen and Näkkäläjärvi, 2018 for impacts on Indigenous peoples in the EU; Saboohi  et al., 2019). Local perceptions about climate change in turn influence adaptation behaviours in settlements and urban communities (Lee  et al., 2015; Larcom, She and van Gevelt, 2019). Engagement with Indigenous and local knowledge is an enabling condition for planning community-appropriate climate adaptation responses (Fernández-Llamazares  et al., 2015). Urban decision making that includes Indigenous and local knowledge has co-benefits for addressing indigenous dispossession, historical inequities and marginalisation of indigenous values that occurred (Parsons  et al., 2019; Carter, 2019; Maldonado  et al., 2016; Orlove  et al., 2014; Pearce  et al., 2015). Indigenous and local knowledge can help deliver culturally appropriate strategies and local choices for urban risk management through, for example community-based observation networks (Alessa  et al., 2016), integrating ecosystem-based adaptation strategies in institutional structures (Nalau  et al., 2018), using multiple evidence-based approaches (Tengö et al., 2014), and adopting forms of governance that centre Indigenous peoples in urban adaptation and decision making (Horn, 2018; Parsons, Fisher and Nalau, 2016)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The scale, reach and complexity of contemporary urbanisation compounds climate risks and conditions adaptation (high confidence) (Miller and Hutchins, 2017; Rosenzweig  et al., 2018b). Urbanisation manifests as a heterogeneous and plural process with varied spatial manifestations (Oswin, 2018) that extends beyond cities and settlements, defining actions elsewhere in what has been called ‘planetary urbanization’ (Brenner, 2014b). While the concept of planetary urbanisation is contested, for example for a predominantly Eurocentric focus (Vegliò, 2021), the concept has reflected human urbanisation as a mega-trend of urban expansion and landuse intensification (Capon, 2017; Lauermann, 2018). Three dimensions of planetary urbanisation are currently shaping adaptation actions: the new forms and scales of urbanisation, the blurring of boundaries around clearly demarcated territories, and the fragmentation of the urban hinterland into units that serve productive functions for the reproduction of urban space under capitalism (Brenner and Schmid, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Planetary scale urbanisation challenges current understandings of spatial settlements and how risk affects urban communities (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Ruddick  et al., 2018). Massive urbanisation manifests in large agglomerations such as metropolitan areas and urban regions, conurbations with unique risk challenges, particularly when interacting with other drivers of vulnerability (Adetokunbo and Emeka, 2015; Maragno, Pozzer and Musco, 2021). Experiences of regional collaboration to scale adaptation to metropolitan areas have shown to be effective, particularly facilitating information and technology exchanges and institutional cooperation (Shi, 2019; Lundqvist, 2016), but may face challenges such as addressing administrative and fiscal requirements and enrolling local populations in a meaningful participation process (Shi, 2019). For example, the coordination of planning policies in the Vienna–Bratislava metropolitan region, further divided by an international border, demonstrates that institutional coordination alone is not sufficient to deliver effective spatial governance: instead, meaningful spatial policies required the involvement of multiple actors (Patti, 2017). In addition to institutional coordination, adaptation in rapidly urbanising areas requires understanding how these processes magnify risk and condition urban responses (see also Section 6.3)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Urban expansion processes affect human settlements everywhere, regardless of their size. Figure 6.1 represents a continuum of settlements from high- to low-density areas (Ward and Shackleton, 2016). Urban and rural areas are not always clearly differentiated (Brenner, 2014a; Brenner and Schmid, 2017). For example, in 2010/2011, drought-exacerbated wildfires across Russia’s agricultural hinterland not only led to increased air pollution in Moscow and other large cities in the region, it also disrupted global supply chains of wheat and caused skyrocketing global food prices (Zscheischler  et al., 2018). Floods in Bangkok, Thailand in 2011 destroyed many foreign-owned factories, leading to a global shortfall in different types of IT equipment (Levermann, 2014)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Rural areas provide ecosystem services that benefit cities directly, including through reducing hazards (runoff, and temperature) and through carbon storage, and can be maintained through urban markets and other inputs (Gebre and Gebremedhin, 2019). Most urban areas extend into dispersive peri-urban areas where urban and rural land uses co-exist (Simon, 2016) and/or suburban areas which are lower density and primarily residential in function. Moreover, the urban and rural differentiation creates normative expectations at the heart of planning conflicts and constraints of urban governance (Taylor, Butt and Amati, 2017). Expanding peri-urban areas pose specific structural constraints to addressing risks. In Bogotá, Colombia, a study found marked inequalities as more impoverished families had restricted access to peri-urban forests, trees and tree services (Escobedo  et al., 2015). Factors such as limited land ownership and tenure insecurity in peri-urban areas hinder people’s ability to invest in permanent infrastructure to buffer themselves from flood events, as witnessed in the slums in Nairobi (Thorn, Thornton and Helfgott, 2015). Building resilience and adaptation via community mobilisation may not be effective in peri-urban areas shaped by migration, agricultural intensification and industrialisation (Wandl and Magoni, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"At the same time, actions to improve access to peri-urban services almost always improve resilience (Simon, 2016) Evidence from Kampala, Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Ibadan, Nairobi, Dakar and Accra shows that urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry can support adaptation (Lwasa  et al., 2014). In the metropolitan area of Milan, multi-functional agriculture supports a local, more sustainable food chain (Magoni and Colucci, 2017). Since communities in peri-urban areas are often transitory, efforts toward creating social capital by promoting civic engagement are crucial to facilitate collective action (Narain  et al., 2017). For example, adaptation actions can help to build the capacity of the community to engage with service providers (Harris, Chu and Ziervogel, 2018; Ziervogel  et al., 2017), as demonstrated in parts of peri-urban Kolkata, India and Khulna, and Bangladesh (Gomes and Hermans, 2018; Gomes, Hermans and Thissen, 2018)."

For example, peri-urban areas typically extend over multiple government jurisdictions (Wandl and Magoni, 2017). Adaptation actions can be difficult to plan, coordinate, implement and evaluate in these transboundary contexts (Solecki  et al., 2018; Srivastava, 2020; Fünfgeld, 2015; Rukmana, 2020; Carter  et al., 2018). In Medellín, Colombia, a 46-mile-long green belt is being built to stop urban expansion while also protecting urban forests, providing access to green spaces, and reducing urban heat island effects (Anguelovski  et al., 2016). However, large-scale infrastructure projects such as this one require coordination between regional transport authorities and the different municipalities in charge of housing and public services, in addition to consulting communities on their social impact (Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017). Local and regional authorities have competing mandates, such as a competition for taxpaying residents in peri-urban, commuting zones, and different infrastructure investment logics, political drivers and constituent needs. Smaller discrete infrastructure projects that actively engage local populations may provide better opportunities to build resilience across fragmented spaces (Santos, 2017; Kamalipour and Dovey, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Suburbanisation follows a gradual movement of citizens from high-density urban centres to the suburbs (Pieretti, 2014). The development of enclaves for higher-income people that appropriate resources and constrain access to those resources for disadvantaged populations has been recorded in places as distant as Santiago de Chile, People’s Republic of China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines (Calvet and Castán Broto, 2016; Phelps, Miao and Zhang, 2020; Bulkeley, Castán Broto and Edwards, 2014; Buchori  et al., 2021; Kleibert, 2018). The appropriation of land and resources in enclaves defends exclusive, privileged communities at the expense of everyone else. Enclaves exacerbate inequalities because those who cannot afford to live in the enclave suffer the fragmentation of public services, restrictions in access to resources, and greater exposure to climate risks (Hodson, 2010; Haase  et al., 2017). Moreover, suburbanisation is linked to the privatisation of public spaces and the decline of public infrastructures, collective spaces and green projects (Long and Rice, 2019; North, Nurse and Barker, 2017). Climate gentrification, whereby vulnerable communities are displaced from urban areas with lower climate risks (UN-Habitat, 2020), reconfigures urban areas, for example, as higher-income populations move away from the city centres, as shown in North American cities that have already suffered climate-related impacts such as Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018; Shokry, Connolly and Anguelovski, 2020; De Koning and Filatova, 2020; Aune, Gesch and Smith, 2020)."

Similarly, SDG9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation, with associated targets. The IPCC 1.5 special report emphasized that there are often co-benefits in pursuit of SDGs and adaptation strategies where ‘well-designed mitigation and adaptation responses can support poverty alleviation, food security, healthy ecosystems, equality and other dimensions of sustainable development’ (IPCC, 2018 FAQ5.1). However there may also be negative trade-offs, for example between pursuit of growth and reducing climate change risk (International Council for Science, 2017; IPCC, 2018 Executive Summary; Roy  et al., 2018a)."

Over two-thirds, 113 out of 164, of initial Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), prior to ratification, had referenced urban responses in the context of sustainable development, climate mitigation and adaptation (UN-Habitat, 2016a). Analysis of those INDCs revealed 58 focused on urban climate adaptation, 17 focused on both adaptation and mitigation, and 4 focused on mitigation (UN-Habitat, 2017). Simultaneously, multiple efforts have emerged to align the actions of nation states with those of other actors, including the UNFCC 2014 Global Climate Action Portal (Hsu, Weinfurter and Xu, 2017). While significant optimism has been gathered around the possibility to intervene at sub-national level, the most difficult challenge has been to establish a coherent view of the overall contribution that cities and settlements are making (Hale, 2016; Chan  et al., 2015b). Although meeting the Paris goals will require staying within a ‘carbon budget’, supporting rapidly developing urban areas in the Global South to the same infrastructure level as developed cities may consume significant proportions of that budget (Bai et al., 2018)."

International efforts also include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (Data Driven Yale New Climate Institute PBL, 2018). There is also a proliferation of new non-governmental and public-private actors that address both adaptation and mitigation in cities and settlements, including: the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, 100 Resilient Cities; the Global Resilient Cities Network, We Mean Business, and We Are Still In (Ireland and Clausen, 2019) and the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (Dean  et al., 2016).

wg2_ch06_6.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In addition to direct climate impacts, interactions among changing urban form, exposure and vulnerability can create climate change-induced risks and losses for cities and settlements. Climate change already interacts with ongoing global trends in urbanisation to create regionally specific impacts and risk profiles. Through demographic change and encroachment into natural and agricultural lands and coastal zones, rapidly expanding urban settlements can place new physical assets and people in locations with high exposure (Tessler  et al., 2015; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Kundzewicz  et al., 2014). Increasing rates of global urbanisation will pose additional challenges to areas that have high levels of poverty, unemployment, informality, and housing and service backlogs (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017; Williams  et al., 2019). There is some evidence to suggest that climate change impacts themselves are increasing urbanisation rates, generating a challenging feedback loop. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, manufacturing towns have experienced growth because of population movement following droughts in agricultural hinterlands (Henderson, Storeygard and Deichmann, 2017). The rapid rate of urbanisation therefore presents a time-limited opportunity to work toward risk reduction and transformational adaptation in towns and cities. The following sections explore these dynamic interactions between urban systems and climate change, and how these shape risk for people and for key infrastructures."

For risk reduction at regional scales, scenarios require urban-relevant climate projections, for example, downscaling from global and regional climate models of variables such as temperature, precipitation, air pollutants and sea level rise that are analysed usually for mid- or end-21st Century timeframes (e.g., Mika  et al., 2018; Kusaka  et al., 2016; Masson  et al., 2014b). These data are needed to ascertain likely ranges of climate change impacts within city and settlement boundaries, and to quantify physical exposure when developing pathways for risk reduction. Consideration of current and projected future growth pathways of multiple urban sectors and key infrastructure, for example, transport, energy and buildings, are also needed to estimate probabilities of risk outcomes and damages within and across urban systems (O’Neill  et al., 2015)(WGIII AR6 Section 8)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The challenges of managing these risks are amplified by the complex interactions between climate and urban scenarios, owing to the smaller spatial–temporal scales of urban areas in climate change modelling relative to global climate models (GCM) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP); geographical or geomorphological variations in city location; uncertainties arising from incomplete assumptions about socio-economic pathways at urban scales affecting urban demographics, for example, fertility rates and life expectancies or increased rural–urban migration; and challenges in modelling the urban climate and in developing urban climate observational networks in cities (WGI Box 10.3; Kamei, Hanaki and Kurisu, 2016; Yu, Jiang and Zhai, 2016; Jiang and O’Neill, 2017; Baklanov  et al., 2018).

wg2_ch06_6.2.2_p1,6.2.2.1 Temperatures and the Urban Heat Island ,"Urban systems interact with climate systems in multiple, dynamic and complex ways (Section 6.1.1, Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021 Box 10.3). Climate change can have direct impacts on the functioning of urban systems, while the nature of those systems plays a substantial role in modifying the effects of climate change (high confidence) (Frank, Delano and Caniglia, 2017; Smid and Costa, 2018). An example of this urban system climate nexus is the urban heat island effect (discussed in Section 6.2.3.1) (Susca and Pomponi, 2020). Assessing the inter-relationships between multiple systems and a range of hazards is particularly important as many cities are presently exposed to multiple climate-related hazards: more than 100 cities analysed as part of a 571 city study in Europe were deemed vulnerable to two or more climate impacts (Guerreiro  et al., 2018). Rapid expansion of urban areas increases the exposure of urban populations to various hazards independent of global climate change. Huang et al. (2019) project that urban land areas will expand by 0.6–1.3 million km 2 between 2015 and 2050, an increase of 78–171% over the urban footprint in 2015. Specifically in relation to floods and droughts, Güneralp et al. (2015) calculate that even without accounting for climate change, the extent of urban areas exposed to flood hazards will increase 2.7 times between 2000 and 2030, the extent exposed to drought hazards will approximately double during this period, and urban land exposed to both floods and droughts will increase more than 2.5 times."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2_p2,6.2.2.1 Temperatures and the Urban Heat Island ,"This section assesses observed and expected impacts from the main hazards identified for cities, settlements and infrastructure; temperature extremes (and the urban heat island), flooding (including sea level rise), water scarcity and security, as well as other hazards that are either less well-studied and/or likely to affect only a limited number of locations. The data assessed in this section are limited by uneven coverage. Despite improvements since AR5, data continue to be more complete for extreme events than for chronic hazards and everyday risks, which may have high aggregate impacts and disproportionately erode the well-being of urban poor households, especially for the most vulnerable, including women, children, the aged, disabled and homeless (van Wesenbeeck, Sonneveld and Voortman, 2016; Kinay  et al., 2019; Connelly  et al., 2018). Data coverage is also less comprehensive for smaller settlements in poorer countries, the locations where urban growth is often high and adaptive capacities are often low (e.g., Rufat  et al., 2015). Thus, data gaps frequently coincide with highly vulnerable populations (Rufat  et al., 2015; Satterthwaite and Bartlett, 2017). Here, even small changes in livelihoods, health, or representation and voice can rapidly bring households into positions of risk, even when hazard conditions are relatively stable (Ziervogel  et al., 2017). These structural limits in available data are discussed also in Section 7 (Health, Well-being and the Changing Structure of Communities) and Section 8 (Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development), and in Doblas-Reyes et al. (2021) Box 10.3. There are implications also for adaptation (Section 6.3), where the greater availability of evidence on exposure-driven risk can limit resilience-building interventions that focus on the reduction of vulnerability."

Future urbanisation will amplify projected local air temperature increase, particularly by strong influence on minimum temperatures, which is approximately comparable in magnitude to global warming (high confidence) (Arias et al. In Press Box TS14). Within cities, exposure to heat island effects is uneven, with some populations disproportionately exposed to risk including low income communities, children, the elderly, disabled, and ethnic minorities (Quintana-Talvac  et al., 2021; Sabrin  et al., 2020; Chambers, 2020; and see later in this section)."

Depending on the RCP, between half (RCP2.6) to three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the human population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Figure 6.3; Mora  et al., 2017; Zhao  et al., 2021). Cities in mid-latitudes are potentially subject to twice the levels of heat stress compared with their rural surroundings under all RCP scenarios by 2050, for example Belgian cities (Wouters  et al., 2017). A disproportionate level of exposure exists in subtropical cities subject to year-round warm temperatures and higher humidity, requiring less warming to exceed ‘dangerous’ thresholds, for example Nairobi (Scott  et al., 2017) and São Paulo (Diniz, Gonçalves and Sheridan, 2020). It is expected that more than 90% of the 300 million people who will be exposed to super- and ultra-extreme heatwaves in the Middle East and North Africa will live in urban centres (Zittis  et al., 2021), while the major driver for increased heat exposure is the combination of global warming and population growth in already-warm cities in regions including Africa, India and the Middle East (Klein and Anderegg, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Locally, the urban heat island also elevates temperatures within cities relative to their surroundings. It is caused by physical changes to the surface energy balance of the pre-urban site from urbanisation, resulting from the thermal characteristics and spatial arrangement of the built environment, and anthropogenic heat release (Oke  et al., 2017; Chow  et al., 2014; Susca and Pomponi, 2020; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021 FAQ10.1). A considerable body of evidence exists on how the multi-scale impacts and consequent risks arise when local elevated temperatures within settlements are enhanced by climate change, with specific elements of this affecting megacities (Darmanto  et al., 2019). The urban heat island itself is amplified during heatwaves (Founda and Santamouris, 2017), but the extent to which varies regionally and by time of day (Ward  et al., 2016a; Zhao  et al., 2018b; Eunice Lo  et al., 2020). When combined with warming induced by urban growth, extreme heat risks are expected to affect half of the future urban population, with a particular impact in the tropical Global South and in coastal cities and settlements (Huang  et al., 2019; Section CCP2.2.2; Table CCP2.A.1)."

Heat stress and dehydration are also related to behavioural and learning concerns, with dehydration impairing concentration and cognition for both adults and children (Merhej, 2019). Literature on paediatric heat exposure is associated with increases in emergency department visits for heat-related illnesses, electrolyte imbalances, fever, renal disease and respiratory disease in young children (Winquist  et al., 2016), with less severe outcomes such as lethargy, headaches, rashes, cramps and exhaustion negatively affecting children in school and play environments (Vanos, 2015; Hyndman, 2017). Young children in cities are particularly sensitive to heatwaves, and may have little experience or capacity to cope with heat extremes (Norwegian Red Cross, 2019). Such vulnerability of young children to heat is compounded with projected urbanisation rates and poor infrastructure, particularly in South Asian and in African cities (Smith, 2019). There is evidence that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are more likely  to live in hotter parts of cities associated with higher-density residential land use in dwellings with less effective insulation built with poorer or older construction materials (Inostroza, Palme and de la Barrera, 2016; Tomlinson  et al., 2011). Specific emerging risks for occupational and related heat illnesses are found in urban tropical or subtropical low- and middle-income countries (Andrews  et al., 2018; Green  et al., 2019)."

Most of these studies employed numerical simulations in which different climate scenarios were used to construct future climate data.

These risks are also driven by increasing societal complexity, urban developmental policy on flood control and long-term economic growth (Berndtsson  et al., 2019), including in mega-cities (Januriyadi  et al., 2018). The increase in flood risk from urban development can be considerable; based on modelling of two RCP (4.5 and 8.5) scenarios, Kaspersen et al. (2017) noted flooding in four European cities could increase by up to 10% for every 1% increase in impervious surface area. Risks are also compounded by the location of settlements, with greater risks within cities located in low elevation coastal zones subject to sea level rise, potential land subsidence and exposure to tropical cyclones ((Koop and van Leeuwen, 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg  et al., 2018; see also Section CCP2.2) and within informal settlements, where generally little investment in drainage solutions exists and flooding regularly disrupts livelihoods and disproportionately undermines local food safety and security for the urban poor (Dodman, Colenbrander and Archer, 2017; Dodman  et al., 2017; Kundzewicz  et al., 2014; Sections 5.4 and 5.8)."

In particular, Asian cities are highly exposed to future flood risks arising from urbanisation processes. Between 2000 and 2030, rapid urbanisation in Indonesia will elevate flood risks by 76–120% for river and coastal floods, while sea level rise will further increase the exposure by 19–37% (Muis  et al., 2015). In Can Tho, Vietnam, current urban development patterns put new assets and infrastructure at risk due to sea level rise and river flooding in the Mekong Delta (Chinh  et al., 2017; Chinh  et al., 2016). Flooding in urban areas is exacerbated both by the encroachment of urban areas into areas that retain water and by the lack of infrastructure such as embankments and flood walls, as is the case for large areas of Dhaka East (Haque, Bithell and Richards, 2020). Zhou et al.

The economic risks associated with future surface water flooding in towns and cities are considerable. For example in the UK, expected annual damages from surface water flooding may increase by £60–200 million for projected 2–4°C warming scenarios; enhanced adaptation actions could manage flooding up to a 2°C scenario but will be insufficient beyond that (Sayers  et al., 2015). Analyses conducted in South Korea suggests that future flood levels could exceed current flood protection design standards by as much as 70% by 2100, considerably increasing urban flood risk (Kang  et al., 2016). Modelling of urban flood damage in the Kelani River Basin in Sri Lanka showed increased frequency of flooding by 2030 could increase potential urban property damage by up to 10.2% (Komolafe Akinola, Herath and Avtar, 2018). Urban flood impacts may also exacerbate health burdens (including disease outbreaks of malaria, typhoid and cholera), which are compounded by damage to medical facilities (e.g., damage to hospitals and disruption of medicinal supply chains), as observed in urban areas of Ghana (Gough  et al., 2019). In addition, emerging research shows the cascading consequences of hazard events, in this case urban flooding, on other risks to well-being in ways that are particularly severe for the urban poor, including mental ill-health, incidents of domestic violence impacting children and women, chronic diseases and salinity of drinking water ((Matsuyama, Khan and Khalequzzaman, 2020); Section 4.2.4.5; Section 6.2.4.2; Box 7.2; Section 8.4.5.2)."

Although frequencies and intensities of cold spells/cold waves are virtually certain to have decreased globally, and are projected to consistently decrease for most warming levels (high confidence; WGI Table 11.2), cold weather events can periodically occur and impact urban areas and their connected infrastructures. For cities in eastern Canada, the intra-annual distribution of freezing rain events may become more frequent from December to February, and less frequent in other months by 2100 (Cheng, Li and Auld, 2011). Freezing rain is also a risk to urban populations and infrastructure. In general, higher population mortality rates likely  occur during the winter season, while more temperature-attributable deaths are caused by cold than by heat in cities located in temperate climates (Gasparrini  et al., 2015; Chen  et al., 2017; Ryti, Guo and Jaakkola, 2016). Winter mortality is unlikely  to significantly decrease due to warming trends, partly because a range of other medical factors (e.g., influenza seasons and elevations in cardiac risk factors) also drive this winter-excess mortality (Kinney  et al., 2015). However, the evidence is unclear whether mortality related to cold waves will decrease in coming decades in European (Smid  et al., 2019) or US cities (Wang  et al., 2016). While projected global cold extremes are expected to decrease in frequency and intensity, the higher regional variability of future climates means that cold waves may remain locally important threats, including in milder regions where there are larger temperature differences between ‘normal’ winter days and extreme cold events, and where there is less capacity to adapt (Ma, Chen and Kan, 2014; Ho  et al., 2019). This will be accentuated in many cities, particularly in Europe, by anticipated demographic changes that result in a more elderly population susceptible to cold wave health risks (Smid  et al., 2019)."

Six major power outages associated with cold shocks and ice storms have been recorded since 2010, the majority recorded from large cities in the USA (Añel  et al., 2017).

While geomorphological events (e.g., land subsidence from permafrost thaw at high latitudes or from groundwater extraction) and factors associated with the built environment (e.g., settlement location adjacent to steep slopes and zonation laws for building construction) are major factors determining urban landslide risk, these can also be influenced by a range of climatic variables, namely precipitation (frequency, intensity and duration), snow melt and temperature change. Some 48 million people are exposed to landslide risk in Europe alone, with the majority in smaller urban centres (Mateos  et al., 2020). Travassos et al. (2020) also documented all landslide deaths in the São Paulo Macro Metropolis Region from 2016 to 2019 that occurred from extreme rainfall events in vulnerable areas prone to landslides. An increase in the number of people exposed to urban landslide risks is projected for landslide-prone settlements lying within regions projected to experience a corresponding increase in extreme rainfall (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016). In addition, human factors such as expansion of towns onto unstable land and land use changes within settlements (e.g., road building, deforestation) are increasing human exposure to landslides and the likelihood of landslides occurring (Kirschbaum, Stanley and Zhou, 2015). Rainfall triggered landslides kill at least 5000 people per year, and at least 11.7% of these landslides occurred on road networks (Froude and Petley, 2018). Although the spatial footprint of an individual landslide might be small (i.e., < 1 km 2), the ‘vulnerability shadow’ cast over an area in terms of regional transport network disruptions can be a significant proportion of a region, and cascade to other infrastructures (Winter  et al., 2016)."

Despite recent observed improvements in air quality arising from COVID-19 restrictions (Krecl  et al., 2020; Naik et al., 2021 Cross-Chapter Box 6.1), significant risks to human health in cities leading to premature mortality very likely  arise from exposure to decreased outdoor air quality from a combination of biogenic (e.g., wildfires at the WUI that advect into the urban atmosphere [Reddington  et al., 2014; Naik et al., 2021 Chapter 12 Box 12.1]) and anthropogenic sources that are influenced by climate change (e.g., fine particulate matter such as PM2.5, tropospheric ozone, oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds [Burnett  et al., 2018; Knight  et al., 2016; Turner  et al., 2016; West  et al., 2016; Chang  et al., 2019b; Li  et al., 2019a; Alexader, Luisa and Molina, 2016; Naik et al., 2021 Sections 6.5.1, 6.7.1.1, 6.7.1.2]). Risks of premature mortality from indoor air pollution in cities, arising from biomass burning for heating in winter or cooking, indoor pesticide use or exposure to volatile organic compounds from poor thermal insulation in buildings, are also likely  to occur (Leung, 2015; Peduzzi  et al., 2020; Cross-Chapter Box HEALTH in Chapter 7)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p13,NO_TITLE,"The mortality risk for several pollutants, for example PM2.5,  is considerable (high confidence). Current estimates indicate that 95% of global population live in areas where ambient PM2.5 exceeds the WHO guideline of annual average exposure of 10 µg m −3 (Shaddick  et al., 2018a; Shaddick  et al., 2018b; Chang  et al., 2019b). Among the 250 most populous urban areas, estimated PM2.5 concentrations are generally highest in cities in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and East Asia; PM2.5 in many cities in North Africa and the Middle East is likely  due mainly to wind-blown dust, whereas that in South Asia and East Asia are mainly anthropogenic in origin (Anenberg  et al., 2019). However, data on PM2.5 concentrations are unavailable in many cities in low- and middle-income countries owing to a lack of measurements (Martin  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p14,NO_TITLE,"For some air pollutants, for example concentrations of PM2.5 in several US, Western European and Chinese cities have recently decreased as a result of clean air regulations that have controlled emissions from sources such as motor vehicles, fossil fuel power plants and major industries (Zheng  et al., 2018a; Fleming  et al., 2018). These decreases have brought substantial improvements in public health in settlements within these regions (Ciarelli  et al., 2019; Zhang  et al., 2018). In South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa, however, concentrations of other air pollutants, for example tropospheric ozone, oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds are likely  to  continue to grow and peak by mid-century before they subside due to global urbanisation assumptions embedded in the SSPs (Naik et al., 2021 Sections 6.2.1; 6.7.1.2). Broadly, future air pollutant emissions are projected to decline globally by 2050 as societies become wealthier and more willing to invest in air pollution controls, but the trajectories vary among pollutants, world regions and scenarios (Silva  et al., 2016b; Rao  et al., 2017; Silva  et al., 2016c). Whereas cities in East Asia and South Asia currently have large exposure to anthropogenic air pollution, African cities may emerge by 2050 as the most polluted because of growing populations and demand for energy, increased urbanisation and relatively weak regulations to control emissions (Liousse  et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p15,NO_TITLE,"Studies modelling climate change impacts on air quality find that the spatiotemporal patterns of concentration changes vary strongly at urban scales, and that often those patterns differ among the different years modelled due to internal variability (Saari  et al., 2019) and different models used (Weaver  et al., 2009). Changes in PM2.5 due to climate change are less clear than for ozone and may be relatively smaller (Westervelt  et al., 2019) as climate change can affect PM2.5 species differently (Fiore, Naik and Leibensperger, 2015). For Beijing, climate change is expected to cause a 50% increase in the frequency of meteorological conditions conducive to high PM2.5 concentrations (Cai  et al., 2017). The impacts of future climate change on air quality and consequent risks on human health have been studied at urban (Knowlton  et al., 2004; Physick, Cope and Lee, 2014) and national scales (Fann  et al., 2015; Orru  et al., 2013; Doherty, Heal and O’Connor, 2017); globally, these studies have found a likely  net increased risk of climate change on air pollution-related health (low confidence). They have focused mainly on the USA and Europe, with few studies elsewhere (Orru, Ebi and Forsberg, 2017), although the relationship between climate and air quality in megacities is particularly complex (Baklanov, Luisa and Molina, 2016). Silva et al. (2017) found that global premature mortality attributable to climate change (and not from urbanisation) from ozone and PM2.5 will increase by about 260,000 deaths per year in 2100 under RCP8.5, but substantial variance in results exists between individual models."

Future urbanisation will amplify projected local air temperature increase, particularly by strong influence on minimum temperatures, which is approximately comparable in magnitude to global warming (high confidence) (Arias et al. In Press Box TS14). Within cities, exposure to heat island effects is uneven, with some populations disproportionately exposed to risk including low income communities, children, the elderly, disabled, and ethnic minorities (Quintana-Talvac  et al., 2021; Sabrin  et al., 2020; Chambers, 2020; and see later in this section)."

Depending on the RCP, between half (RCP2.6) to three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the human population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Figure 6.3; Mora  et al., 2017; Zhao  et al., 2021). Cities in mid-latitudes are potentially subject to twice the levels of heat stress compared with their rural surroundings under all RCP scenarios by 2050, for example Belgian cities (Wouters  et al., 2017). A disproportionate level of exposure exists in subtropical cities subject to year-round warm temperatures and higher humidity, requiring less warming to exceed ‘dangerous’ thresholds, for example Nairobi (Scott  et al., 2017) and São Paulo (Diniz, Gonçalves and Sheridan, 2020). It is expected that more than 90% of the 300 million people who will be exposed to super- and ultra-extreme heatwaves in the Middle East and North Africa will live in urban centres (Zittis  et al., 2021), while the major driver for increased heat exposure is the combination of global warming and population growth in already-warm cities in regions including Africa, India and the Middle East (Klein and Anderegg, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Locally, the urban heat island also elevates temperatures within cities relative to their surroundings. It is caused by physical changes to the surface energy balance of the pre-urban site from urbanisation, resulting from the thermal characteristics and spatial arrangement of the built environment, and anthropogenic heat release (Oke  et al., 2017; Chow  et al., 2014; Susca and Pomponi, 2020; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021 FAQ10.1). A considerable body of evidence exists on how the multi-scale impacts and consequent risks arise when local elevated temperatures within settlements are enhanced by climate change, with specific elements of this affecting megacities (Darmanto  et al., 2019). The urban heat island itself is amplified during heatwaves (Founda and Santamouris, 2017), but the extent to which varies regionally and by time of day (Ward  et al., 2016a; Zhao  et al., 2018b; Eunice Lo  et al., 2020). When combined with warming induced by urban growth, extreme heat risks are expected to affect half of the future urban population, with a particular impact in the tropical Global South and in coastal cities and settlements (Huang  et al., 2019; Section CCP2.2.2; Table CCP2.A.1)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Heat risk is associated with a range of health issues for urban residents, with the consequences of higher urban temperatures being unevenly distributed across urban populations (high confidence). Clear evidence exists of increased health risks to elderly populations in settlements, especially higher levels of mortality in elderly populations from urban heat islands during heatwave events (Fernandez Milan and Creutzig, 2015; Taylor  et al., 2015; Ward  et al., 2016a; Heaviside, Macintyre and Vardoulakis, 2017; Gough  et al., 2019; Xu  et al., 2020a), while health and fitness variables are also major determinants of the effects of heat stress (Schuster  et al., 2017) (see also Table 7.2). Heat stress and dehydration are also related to behavioural and learning concerns, with dehydration impairing concentration and cognition for both adults and children (Merhej, 2019). Literature on paediatric heat exposure is associated with increases in emergency department visits for heat-related illnesses, electrolyte imbalances, fever, renal disease and respiratory disease in young children (Winquist  et al., 2016), with less severe outcomes such as lethargy, headaches, rashes, cramps and exhaustion negatively affecting children in school and play environments (Vanos, 2015; Hyndman, 2017). Young children in cities are particularly sensitive to heatwaves, and may have little experience or capacity to cope with heat extremes (Norwegian Red Cross, 2019). Such vulnerability of young children to heat is compounded with projected urbanisation rates and poor infrastructure, particularly in South Asian and in African cities (Smith, 2019). There is evidence that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are more likely  to live in hotter parts of cities associated with higher-density residential land use in dwellings with less effective insulation built with poorer or older construction materials (Inostroza, Palme and de la Barrera, 2016; Tomlinson  et al., 2011).

Decreases in thermal comfort and increases in overheating risks depend on building characteristics, such as thermal resistance, presence of solar shading, thermal mass, ventilation, orientation and geographical location (e.g., Liu and Coley, 2015; van Hooff  et al., 2014; Vardoulakis  et al., 2015; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Taylor  et al., 2016; Hamdy  et al., 2017; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Salthammer  et al., 2018; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019; Osman and Sevinc, 2019; Roshan, Oji and Attia, 2019; Alves, Gonçalves and Duarte, 2021). Most of these studies employed numerical simulations in which different climate scenarios were used to construct future climate data. In hot climates, energy-efficient buildings with high insulation values and high airtightness, which have insufficient protection from solar heat gains and/or limited ventilation capabilities, are generally more vulnerable to overheating than older buildings with lower insulation levels (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Vardoulakis  et al., 2015; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Salthammer  et al., 2018; Fisk, 2015; Hamdy  et al., 2017; Fosas  et al., 2018; Ozarisoy and Elsharkawy, 2019; see also Fox-Kemper et al., 2021 9.7 for building heat mitigation/adaptation links)."

These risks are also driven by increasing societal complexity, urban developmental policy on flood control and long-term economic growth (Berndtsson  et al., 2019), including in mega-cities (Januriyadi  et al., 2018). The increase in flood risk from urban development can be considerable; based on modelling of two RCP (4.5 and 8.5) scenarios, Kaspersen et al. (2017) noted flooding in four European cities could increase by up to 10% for every 1% increase in impervious surface area. Risks are also compounded by the location of settlements, with greater risks within cities located in low elevation coastal zones subject to sea level rise, potential land subsidence and exposure to tropical cyclones ((Koop and van Leeuwen, 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg  et al., 2018; see also Section CCP2.2) and within informal settlements, where generally little investment in drainage solutions exists and flooding regularly disrupts livelihoods and disproportionately undermines local food safety and security for the urban poor (Dodman, Colenbrander and Archer, 2017; Dodman  et al., 2017; Kundzewicz  et al., 2014; Sections 5.4 and 5.8)."

In particular, Asian cities are highly exposed to future flood risks arising from urbanisation processes. Between 2000 and 2030, rapid urbanisation in Indonesia will elevate flood risks by 76–120% for river and coastal floods, while sea level rise will further increase the exposure by 19–37% (Muis  et al., 2015). In Can Tho, Vietnam, current urban development patterns put new assets and infrastructure at risk due to sea level rise and river flooding in the Mekong Delta (Chinh  et al., 2017; Chinh  et al., 2016). Flooding in urban areas is exacerbated both by the encroachment of urban areas into areas that retain water and by the lack of infrastructure such as embankments and flood walls, as is the case for large areas of Dhaka East (Haque, Bithell and Richards, 2020).

The economic risks associated with future surface water flooding in towns and cities are considerable. For example in the UK, expected annual damages from surface water flooding may increase by £60–200 million for projected 2–4°C warming scenarios; enhanced adaptation actions could manage flooding up to a 2°C scenario but will be insufficient beyond that (Sayers  et al., 2015). Analyses conducted in South Korea suggests that future flood levels could exceed current flood protection design standards by as much as 70% by 2100, considerably increasing urban flood risk (Kang  et al., 2016).

Urban flood impacts may also exacerbate health burdens (including disease outbreaks of malaria, typhoid and cholera), which are compounded by damage to medical facilities (e.g., damage to hospitals and disruption of medicinal supply chains), as observed in urban areas of Ghana (Gough  et al., 2019). In addition, emerging research shows the cascading consequences of hazard events, in this case urban flooding, on other risks to well-being in ways that are particularly severe for the urban poor, including mental ill-health, incidents of domestic violence impacting children and women, chronic diseases and salinity of drinking water ((Matsuyama, Khan and Khalequzzaman, 2020); Section 4.2.4.5; Section 6.2.4.2; Box 7.2; Section 8.4.5.2)."

Scarcity risks may also be exacerbated by human and ecosystem needs in water-short years (Srinivasan, Konar and Sivapalan, 2017).

Although frequencies and intensities of cold spells/cold waves are virtually certain to have decreased globally, and are projected to consistently decrease for most warming levels (high confidence; WGI Table 11.2), cold weather events can periodically occur and impact urban areas and their connected infrastructures. For cities in eastern Canada, the intra-annual distribution of freezing rain events may become more frequent from December to February, and less frequent in other months by 2100 (Cheng, Li and Auld, 2011). Freezing rain is also a risk to urban populations and infrastructure. In general, higher population mortality rates likely  occur during the winter season, while more temperature-attributable deaths are caused by cold than by heat in cities located in temperate climates (Gasparrini  et al., 2015; Chen  et al., 2017; Ryti, Guo and Jaakkola, 2016). Winter mortality is unlikely  to significantly decrease due to warming trends, partly because a range of other medical factors (e.g., influenza seasons and elevations in cardiac risk factors) also drive this winter-excess mortality (Kinney  et al., 2015). However, the evidence is unclear whether mortality related to cold waves will decrease in coming decades in European (Smid  et al., 2019) or US cities (Wang  et al., 2016). While projected global cold extremes are expected to decrease in frequency and intensity, the higher regional variability of future climates means that cold waves may remain locally important threats, including in milder regions where there are larger temperature differences between ‘normal’ winter days and extreme cold events, and where there is less capacity to adapt (Ma, Chen and Kan, 2014; Ho  et al., 2019). This will be accentuated in many cities, particularly in Europe, by anticipated demographic changes that result in a more elderly population susceptible to cold wave health risks (Smid  et al., 2019)."

Six major power outages associated with cold shocks and ice storms have been recorded since 2010, the majority recorded from large cities in the USA (Añel  et al., 2017). Cold waves can also significantly increase energy demand. A cold wave that affected the Iberian Peninsula in January 2017 caused electricity prices to peak at a mean price of 112.8 €/MWh, the highest ever recorded in Spain (AEMET, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Landslides. While geomorphological events (e.g., land subsidence from permafrost thaw at high latitudes or from groundwater extraction) and factors associated with the built environment (e.g., settlement location adjacent to steep slopes and zonation laws for building construction) are major factors determining urban landslide risk, these can also be influenced by a range of climatic variables, namely precipitation (frequency, intensity and duration), snow melt and temperature change. Some 48 million people are exposed to landslide risk in Europe alone, with the majority in smaller urban centres (Mateos  et al., 2020). Travassos et al. (2020) also documented all landslide deaths in the São Paulo Macro Metropolis Region from 2016 to 2019 that occurred from extreme rainfall events in vulnerable areas prone to landslides. An increase in the number of people exposed to urban landslide risks is projected for landslide-prone settlements lying within regions projected to experience a corresponding increase in extreme rainfall (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016). In addition, human factors such as expansion of towns onto unstable land and land use changes within settlements (e.g., road building, deforestation) are increasing human exposure to landslides and the likelihood of landslides occurring (Kirschbaum, Stanley and Zhou, 2015). Rainfall triggered landslides kill at least 5000 people per year, and at least 11.7% of these landslides occurred on road networks (Froude and Petley, 2018). Although the spatial footprint of an individual landslide might be small (i.e., < 1 km 2), the ‘vulnerability shadow’ cast over an area in terms of regional transport network disruptions can be a significant proportion of a region, and cascade to other infrastructures (Winter  et al., 2016)."

Microscale wind conditions within urban canyons also strongly affect ventilation of air pollution dispersion and thermal comfort at pedestrian level, especially in cities located in warm climates (Rajagopalan, Lim and Jamei, 2014; Middel  et al., 2014; Lin and Ho, 2016)."

These include wildfires along the margins where cities are adjacent to wildlands, that is, the wildland-urban interface (WUI) (Bento-Gonçalves and Vieira, 2020; Radeloff  et al., 2018), or fires in cities with a high degree of informal settlements having greater vulnerability to fire hazards (Kahanji, Walls and Cicione, 2019; Walls and Zweig, 2017; Sections 8.3.3.2).

Recent wildfires in Australia and California both occurred under hot and dry weather conditions exacerbated by climate change, and resulted in substantial property damage along the WUI, ecosystem destruction and lives lost (Brown  et al., 2020; Lewis  et al., 2020; Yu  et al., 2020). Future climate risk of fires at the WUI are likely  (medium confidence), and are compounded by projected urban development along the WUI within several regions, such as in the Western USA (Syphard  et al., 2019), Australia (Dowdy  et al., 2019) and the Bolivian Chiquitania (Devisscher  et al., 2016)."

Risks of premature mortality from indoor air pollution in cities, arising from biomass burning for heating in winter or cooking, indoor pesticide use or exposure to volatile organic compounds from poor thermal insulation in buildings, are also likely  to occur (Leung, 2015; Peduzzi  et al., 2020; Cross-Chapter Box HEALTH in Chapter 7)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p13,NO_TITLE,"The mortality risk for several pollutants, for example PM2.5,  is considerable (high confidence).

Among the 250 most populous urban areas, estimated PM2.5 concentrations are generally highest in cities in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and East Asia; PM2.5 in many cities in North Africa and the Middle East is likely  due mainly to wind-blown dust, whereas that in South Asia and East Asia are mainly anthropogenic in origin (Anenberg  et al., 2019). However, data on PM2.5 concentrations are unavailable in many cities in low- and middle-income countries owing to a lack of measurements (Martin  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p14,NO_TITLE,"For some air pollutants, for example concentrations of PM2.5 in several US, Western European and Chinese cities have recently decreased as a result of clean air regulations that have controlled emissions from sources such as motor vehicles, fossil fuel power plants and major industries (Zheng  et al., 2018a; Fleming  et al., 2018). These decreases have brought substantial improvements in public health in settlements within these regions (Ciarelli  et al., 2019; Zhang  et al., 2018). In South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa, however, concentrations of other air pollutants, for example tropospheric ozone, oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds are likely  to  continue to grow and peak by mid-century before they subside due to global urbanisation assumptions embedded in the SSPs (Naik et al., 2021 Sections 6.2.1; 6.7.1.2). Broadly, future air pollutant emissions are projected to decline globally by 2050 as societies become wealthier and more willing to invest in air pollution controls, but the trajectories vary among pollutants, world regions and scenarios (Silva  et al., 2016b; Rao  et al., 2017; Silva  et al., 2016c). Whereas cities in East Asia and South Asia currently have large exposure to anthropogenic air pollution, African cities may emerge by 2050 as the most polluted because of growing populations and demand for energy, increased urbanisation and relatively weak regulations to control emissions (Liousse  et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.2.4_p15,NO_TITLE,"Studies modelling climate change impacts on air quality find that the spatiotemporal patterns of concentration changes vary strongly at urban scales, and that often those patterns differ among the different years modelled due to internal variability (Saari  et al., 2019) and different models used (Weaver  et al., 2009). Changes in PM2.5 due to climate change are less clear than for ozone and may be relatively smaller (Westervelt  et al., 2019) as climate change can affect PM2.5 species differently (Fiore, Naik and Leibensperger, 2015). For Beijing, climate change is expected to cause a 50% increase in the frequency of meteorological conditions conducive to high PM2.5 concentrations (Cai  et al., 2017). The impacts of future climate change on air quality and consequent risks on human health have been studied at urban (Knowlton  et al., 2004; Physick, Cope and Lee, 2014) and national scales (Fann  et al., 2015; Orru  et al., 2013; Doherty, Heal and O’Connor, 2017); globally, these studies have found a likely  net increased risk of climate change on air pollution-related health (low confidence). They have focused mainly on the USA and Europe, with few studies elsewhere (Orru, Ebi and Forsberg, 2017), although the relationship between climate and air quality in megacities is particularly complex (Baklanov, Luisa and Molina, 2016). Silva et al. (2017) found that global premature mortality attributable to climate change (and not from urbanisation) from ozone and PM2.5 will increase by about 260,000 deaths per year in 2100 under RCP8.5, but substantial variance in results exists between individual models."

The evidence is also clear that for those with fewest resources and already constrained life chances, losses from climate change associated events reduce well-being and exacerbate vulnerability (high confidence) (van den Berg and Keenan, 2019; Kashem, Wilson and Van Zandt, 2016; Michael, Deshpande and Ziervogel, 2018).

An increasing proportion of refugees and displaced people now live in urban centres, and their characteristics also make them vulnerable to a range of shocks and stresses (Earle, 2016). While some individuals, including children, may be able to exercise agency to reduce their risk (Treichel, 2020), and some indicators are culturally specific, overall, poor, marginalised, socially isolated and informal urban households are particularly at risk (high confidence) (Brown and McGranahan, 2016; Kim  et al., 2020b; Huq  et al., 2020a; Huq  et al., 2020b)."

Informality is one pathway through which urbanisation generates differentiated vulnerability, tending to increase exposure and susceptibility of physical structures and their occupants to climate-related risks (Dodman  et al., 2017; Dobson, 2017) in contexts including Guadalajara, Mexico (Gran Castro and Ramos De Robles, 2019), Kampala, Uganda (Richmond, Myers and Namuli, 2018), Bengaluru, India (Kumar, Geneletti and Nagendra, 2016), and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (Yahia  et al., 2018).

wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Migration, displacement and resettlement each play a foundational role in differentiated vulnerability (see Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). The relationship between migration and vulnerability is complex (robust evidence, high agreement ), and is the first of the three components discussed within this section. Climate change, as a push factor, is only one among multiple drivers (political, economic and social) related to environmental migration (Heslin  et al., 2019; Plänitz, 2019; Luetz and Merson, 2019). There is consensus that it is difficult to pin climate change as the sole driver of internal (within national boundaries) rural to urban migration decisions owing to, among other factors, the disconnect between national and international policies (Wilkinson  et al., 2016), the lack of unifying theoretical frameworks and the complex interactions between climatic and other drivers (social, demographic, economic and political) at multiple scales (Cattaneo  et al., 2019; Borderon  et al., 2019). Environmental migration, including rural to urban migration, triggered by climate change may ensue from either slow- or rapid-onset climatic events and could be either temporary, cyclical or permanent movement that occurs within or beyond national boundaries (Heslin  et al., 2019; Silja, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"A range of specific studies highlight certain elements of vulnerability and migration, including the ways in which slow-onset events affect precarious, resource-dependent livelihoods (such as farming and fisheries) (Cai  et al., 2016). In small town Pakistan and Colombia, heat stress increases long-term migration of men, driven by a negative effect on farm income (Mueller, Gray and Kosec, 2014; Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013). A study from Mexico reveals that an increase in drought months led to increased rural to urban migration, while increased heat (temperature) led to a ‘nonlinear’ pattern of rural to urban migration that occurred only after extended periods of heat (nearly 34 months) (Nawrotzki  et al., 2017). This aligns with other findings that a consistent increase in temperature between 2°C and 4°C in some parts of the world renders involuntary, forced migration inevitable (Otto  et al., 2017)."

Many authors are critical of existing perspectives on climate-related migration, and argue for more nuanced research on the topic (Boas  et al., 2019; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Silja, 2017; Sakdapolrak  et al., 2016; Singh and Basu, 2020; Luetz and Havea, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate-induced migration is not necessarily higher among poorer households whose mobility is more likely to be limited due to the poverty trap (i.e., lack of financial resources) (high confidence) (Cattaneo  et al., 2019; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Silja, 2017). For example, in Bangladesh, vulnerability of rural populations is increasing, so many of the poorest employ migration as a strategy of last resort (Paprocki, 2018; Penning-Rowsell, Sultana and Thompson, 2013; Adri and Simon, 2018) that occurs as soil salinity (as opposed to inundation alone) increases and is paralleled by economic diversification (i.e., aquaculture) (Chen and Mueller, 2018). There is robust evidence and high agreement  that rapid-onset climatic events trigger involuntary migration and short-term, short-distance mobilities (Cattaneo  et al., 2019). There is also robust evidence and high agreement  that slow-onset climatic events (such as droughts and sea level rise) lead to long-distance internal displacement, more so than local or international migration (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Silja, 2017), while sea level rise is expected to lead to the displacement of communities along coastal zones, such as in Florida in the USA (Hauer, 2017; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Migration, including rural–urban migration, is also recognised as an adaptation strategy in some circumstances, whether this is voluntary or planned (Jamero  et al., 2019; Esteban  et al., 2020a; Bettini, 2014). Voluntary migration can be an element of household strategies to diversify risk, depending on the nature of the climatic stress, and interacts with household composition, individual characteristics, social networks, and historical, political and economic contexts (Hunter, Luna and Norton, 2015; Carmin  et al., 2015; Hayward  et al., 2020). For example, in Colombia, rural to urban migration is differentiated across gender depending on the climatic stress whereby men migrate due to droughts, while women migrate due to excessive rain triggers (Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013). Especially in Pacific small island developing states, migration can be a strategy for urban settlements or tribal communities to relocate in customary areas, as in the case of Vunidogoloa in Fiji (McMichael, Katonivualiku and Powell, 2019; Hayward  et al., 2020); it can be a livelihood strategy as shown in the Cataret Islands in Papua New Guinea (Connell, 2016); or it can be used to enhance education and international networks (i.e., voluntary ‘migration with dignity’) as is the case in Kiribati (Heslin  et al., 2019; Voigt-Graf and Kagan, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"The second component, displacement, also plays a crucial role in differentiated vulnerability. The lack of resources and capacities to support mobility limits the effectiveness of migration as an adaptation strategy, therefore leading to both displacement and trapped populations in the future (Adger  et al., 2015; Faist, 2018). For example, studies from Colombia (Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013), India (Singh and Basu, 2020), Mekong Delta in Vietnam (Miller, 2019) and Pakistan (Islam and Khan, 2018) showed that migration as an adaptation strategy can be constrained due to resource barriers and low mobility potential, and also, to high levels of place attachment such as in the Peruvian Highlands (Adams, 2016), Vanuatu (Perumal, 2018) and the Tulun and Nissan Atolls of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea (Luetz and Havea, 2018). Migration can also be maladaptive for the receiving contexts, whether due to the pressure on and/or conflict over land and/or the urban resources (high confidence) (Faist, 2018; Singh and Basu, 2020; Luetz and Havea, 2018). Other views maintain that migration as adaptation overlooks the agency of people and their resilience, that is the nuances of ‘translocal social resilience’ (Kelman, 2018; Silja, 2017; Sakdapolrak  et al., 2016). For example, the ni-Vanuatu prioritise in situ adaptation measures and leave migration as a last resort (Perumal, 2018)."

The protection of livelihoods contributes to ensuring the well-being (physical and mental) and the protection of the rights of communities (high confidence) (Ferris, 2015; Price, 2019). There is limited evidence but high agreement  that the outcomes of resettlement initiatives are complex and multi-faceted (Ferris, 2015).

An increasing proportion of refugees and displaced people now live in urban centres, and their characteristics also make them vulnerable to a range of shocks and stresses (Earle, 2016). While some individuals, including children, may be able to exercise agency to reduce their risk (Treichel, 2020), and some indicators are culturally specific, overall, poor, marginalised, socially isolated and informal urban households are particularly at risk (high confidence) (Brown and McGranahan, 2016; Kim  et al., 2020b; Huq  et al., 2020a; Huq  et al., 2020b)."

According to the United Nations statistics, the proportion of urban populations living in slums and informal settlements increased from 23% in 2014 to 23.5% in 2018 (United Nations, 2018). Informality is one pathway through which urbanisation generates differentiated vulnerability, tending to increase exposure and susceptibility of physical structures and their occupants to climate-related risks (Dodman  et al., 2017; Dobson, 2017) in contexts including Guadalajara, Mexico (Gran Castro and Ramos De Robles, 2019), Kampala, Uganda (Richmond, Myers and Namuli, 2018), Bengaluru, India (Kumar, Geneletti and Nagendra, 2016), and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (Yahia  et al., 2018).

Such inconsistencies between the delivery of land use planning and the aims of the SDGs combine with other social structures, economic pathways and governance systems to shape city risk profiles (Dodman  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Migration, displacement and resettlement each play a foundational role in differentiated vulnerability (see Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). The relationship between migration and vulnerability is complex (robust evidence, high agreement ), and is the first of the three components discussed within this section. Climate change, as a push factor, is only one among multiple drivers (political, economic and social) related to environmental migration (Heslin  et al., 2019; Plänitz, 2019; Luetz and Merson, 2019). There is consensus that it is difficult to pin climate change as the sole driver of internal (within national boundaries) rural to urban migration decisions owing to, among other factors, the disconnect between national and international policies (Wilkinson  et al., 2016), the lack of unifying theoretical frameworks and the complex interactions between climatic and other drivers (social, demographic, economic and political) at multiple scales (Cattaneo  et al., 2019; Borderon  et al., 2019). Environmental migration, including rural to urban migration, triggered by climate change may ensue from either slow- or rapid-onset climatic events and could be either temporary, cyclical or permanent movement that occurs within or beyond national boundaries (Heslin  et al., 2019; Silja, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"A range of specific studies highlight certain elements of vulnerability and migration, including the ways in which slow-onset events affect precarious, resource-dependent livelihoods (such as farming and fisheries) (Cai  et al., 2016). In small town Pakistan and Colombia, heat stress increases long-term migration of men, driven by a negative effect on farm income (Mueller, Gray and Kosec, 2014; Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013). A study from Mexico reveals that an increase in drought months led to increased rural to urban migration, while increased heat (temperature) led to a ‘nonlinear’ pattern of rural to urban migration that occurred only after extended periods of heat (nearly 34 months) (Nawrotzki  et al., 2017). This aligns with other findings that a consistent increase in temperature between 2°C and 4°C in some parts of the world renders involuntary, forced migration inevitable (Otto  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The complexity of migration drivers (as push or pull factors) explains why there is little agreement around quantitative estimates on migration (especially international) triggered by climate change (Silja, 2017; Otto  et al., 2017), and why estimates of future displacement attributed to climate change and other environmental causes vary between 25 million and 1 billion in 2050 (Heslin  et al., 2019). Many authors are critical of existing perspectives on climate-related migration, and argue for more nuanced research on the topic (Boas  et al., 2019; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Silja, 2017; Sakdapolrak  et al., 2016; Singh and Basu, 2020; Luetz and Havea, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate-induced migration is not necessarily higher among poorer households whose mobility is more likely to be limited due to the poverty trap (i.e., lack of financial resources) (high confidence) (Cattaneo  et al., 2019; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Silja, 2017). For example, in Bangladesh, vulnerability of rural populations is increasing, so many of the poorest employ migration as a strategy of last resort (Paprocki, 2018; Penning-Rowsell, Sultana and Thompson, 2013; Adri and Simon, 2018) that occurs as soil salinity (as opposed to inundation alone) increases and is paralleled by economic diversification (i.e., aquaculture) (Chen and Mueller, 2018). There is robust evidence and high agreement  that rapid-onset climatic events trigger involuntary migration and short-term, short-distance mobilities (Cattaneo  et al., 2019). There is also robust evidence and high agreement  that slow-onset climatic events (such as droughts and sea level rise) lead to long-distance internal displacement, more so than local or international migration (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Silja, 2017), while sea level rise is expected to lead to the displacement of communities along coastal zones, such as in Florida in the USA (Hauer, 2017; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Migration, including rural–urban migration, is also recognised as an adaptation strategy in some circumstances, whether this is voluntary or planned (Jamero  et al., 2019; Esteban  et al., 2020a; Bettini, 2014). Voluntary migration can be an element of household strategies to diversify risk, depending on the nature of the climatic stress, and interacts with household composition, individual characteristics, social networks, and historical, political and economic contexts (Hunter, Luna and Norton, 2015; Carmin  et al., 2015; Hayward  et al., 2020). For example, in Colombia, rural to urban migration is differentiated across gender depending on the climatic stress whereby men migrate due to droughts, while women migrate due to excessive rain triggers (Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013). Especially in Pacific small island developing states, migration can be a strategy for urban settlements or tribal communities to relocate in customary areas, as in the case of Vunidogoloa in Fiji (McMichael, Katonivualiku and Powell, 2019; Hayward  et al., 2020); it can be a livelihood strategy as shown in the Cataret Islands in Papua New Guinea (Connell, 2016); or it can be used to enhance education and international networks (i.e., voluntary ‘migration with dignity’) as is the case in Kiribati (Heslin  et al., 2019; Voigt-Graf and Kagan, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"The second component, displacement, also plays a crucial role in differentiated vulnerability. The lack of resources and capacities to support mobility limits the effectiveness of migration as an adaptation strategy, therefore leading to both displacement and trapped populations in the future (Adger  et al., 2015; Faist, 2018). For example, studies from Colombia (Tovar-Restrepo and Irazábal, 2013), India (Singh and Basu, 2020), Mekong Delta in Vietnam (Miller, 2019) and Pakistan (Islam and Khan, 2018) showed that migration as an adaptation strategy can be constrained due to resource barriers and low mobility potential, and also, to high levels of place attachment such as in the Peruvian Highlands (Adams, 2016), Vanuatu (Perumal, 2018) and the Tulun and Nissan Atolls of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea (Luetz and Havea, 2018). Migration can also be maladaptive for the receiving contexts, whether due to the pressure on and/or conflict over land and/or the urban resources (high confidence) (Faist, 2018; Singh and Basu, 2020; Luetz and Havea, 2018). Other views maintain that migration as adaptation overlooks the agency of people and their resilience, that is the nuances of ‘translocal social resilience’ (Kelman, 2018; Silja, 2017; Sakdapolrak  et al., 2016). For example, the ni-Vanuatu prioritise in situ adaptation measures and leave migration as a last resort (Perumal, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.3.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Regardless of the reasons and the initiators for migration, community control over resettlement both at the origin and destination leads to more positive outcomes for both the communities being resettled and the receiving communities (high confidence) (Perumal, 2018; Ferris, 2015; Price, 2019; Mortreux and Adams, 2015; Tadgell, Doberstein and Mortsch, 2018; Luetz and Havea, 2018). The protection of livelihoods contributes to ensuring the well-being (physical and mental) and the protection of the rights of communities (high confidence) (Ferris, 2015; Price, 2019). There is limited evidence but high agreement  that the outcomes of resettlement initiatives are complex and multi-faceted (Ferris, 2015). For example, in Shangnan County, northwest China, the Massive Southern Shaanxi Migration Program, based on voluntary participation, reduced risk exposure and improved the quality of life in general, but also disproportionately increased the vulnerability of disadvantaged groups (the poor, migrants, and those left behind) (Lei  et al., 2017). Similarly, vulnerability increased due to the loss of connection to place and community bonds in Mekong Delta, Vietnam (Miller, 2019), and due to unsafe construction, poor infrastructure, institutional incapacity and general neglect in resettlement initiatives in Malawi, sub-Saharan Africa (Kita, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.4_p1,6.2.4.1 Energy Infrastructure ,"Projected climatic changes, such as changing precipitation patterns, temperatures and sea levels, contribute to pressures on human well-being and the functioning of infrastructure systems (high confidence). Furthermore, risks evolve due to macro-scale drivers of change such as urbanisation, economic development, land use changes and other emergent factors (Adger, Brown and Surminski, 2018). Infrastructure networks are rapidly growing around the world (see Table 6.3). Since the quality and accessibility of infrastructure services are varied, it is important to understand how climate change poses different kinds of risk on them. Infrastructure can be broadly understood to include social infrastructure (housing, health, education, livelihoods and social safety nets, security, cultural heritage/institutions, disaster risk management and urban planning), ecological infrastructure (clean air, flood protection, urban agriculture, temperature, green corridors, watercourses and riverways) and physical infrastructure (energy, transport, communications [including digital], built form, water and sanitation and solid waste management) (Thacker et al., 2019). This section focuses especially on physical infrastructure where the literature provides discrete risk and impact assessments. Physical infrastructure systems are often immobile, indivisible, involve high fixed costs and have longer lifecycles. Social and ecological infrastructure elements are rarely assessed alone and instead tend to be included in wider assessments of event impacts."

For global physical infrastructure with a present value of USD 143 trillion, The Economist Intelligence Unit (2015) estimates present value losses of USD 4.2 trillion by 2100 under a 2°C scenario. This estimation rises to USD 13.8 trillion under a 6°C scenario. Extreme events are associated with disruption or complete loss of these infrastructure services, whilst gradual changes in mean conditions are altering physical infrastructure performance. Physical infrastructure is usually costly to repair and also have significant impacts on people’s health and well-being."
wg2_ch06_6.2.4_p5,6.2.4.1 Energy Infrastructure ,"This section synthesises and assesses the emerging literature on climate change risks to key physical infrastructure domains as listed in Table 6.3: energy/electricity infrastructure, transportation infrastructure and information and communication technology (ICT) (water infrastructure is discussed in Section 6.2.2). It draws on evidence from around the world, but the specific risks to infrastructure in different contexts are explained in more detail in the regional chapters (especially Section 9.8.4.1 for Africa, Section 10.4.6.3.8 for Asia and Section 13.6.1 for Europe). For cities and settlements, such risks are of particular concern owing to a lack of adaptive capacity across many economically important sectors and low levels of resource and capacity support to enhance adaptive capacity. Recent literature also illustrates the interconnected and interdependent nature of infrastructure systems (see Box 6.2), which lead to uncertainties over how risks in one sector lead to cascading, compounding or knock-on effects across other sectors (Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017) (see Section 6.2.6 for elaboration). Therefore, adaptation options should address climate risks to infrastructure in an integrated and co-beneficial manner (medium evidence, high confidence) (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Energy infrastructure underpins modern economies and quality of life. Disruption to power or fuel supplies impacts upon all other infrastructure sectors, and affects businesses, industry, healthcare and other critical services both within and across jurisdictional boundaries (Groundstroem and Juhola, 2019). The economic impacts of climate change risks are significant, for example in the EU, the expected annual damages to energy infrastructure, currently €0.5 billion yr −1, are projected to increase 1612% by the 2080s (Forzieri et al., 2018). In China, 33.9% of the population are vulnerable to electricity supply disruptions from a flood or drought (Hu et al., 2016), whilst in the USA, higher temperatures are projected to increase power system costs by about USD 50 billion by the year 2050 (Jaglom et al., 2014). In a study of 11 Central and Eastern European countries, researchers found that energy poverty is exacerbated by existing infrastructure deficits and energy efficient building stock, as well as income inequality, which can lead to reduced economic productivity (Karpinska and Śmiech, 2020). Climate change is expected to alter energy demand (Viguié et al., 2021), for example heatwaves increase spot market prices (Pechan and Eisenack, 2014), with a disproportionate impact on the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Energy infrastructure are susceptible to a range of climate risks (Cronin, Anandarajah and Dessens, 2018), whilst issues pertaining to energy demand are considered by Working Group III."
wg2_ch06_6.2.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change can, for example, influence energy consumption patterns by changing how household and industrial consumers respond to short-term weather shocks, as well as how they adapt to long-term changes (Auffhammer and Mansur, 2014). Recent studies from Stockholm, Sweden, show that future heating demand will decrease while cooling demand will increase (Nik and Sasic Kalagasidis, 2013). A study from the USA showed that climate change will impact buildings by affecting peak and annual building energy consumption (Fri and Savitz, 2014). From an infrastructure standpoint, the vulnerability of current hydropower and thermoelectric power generation systems may change due to changes in climate and water systems and projected reduction of usable capacities (van Vliet et al., 2016; Byers et al., 2016). These examples show how energy infrastructure planning under climate change must take into account a greater number of scenarios and investigate impacts on particular energy segments (Sharifi and Yamagata, 2016)."

wg2_ch06_6.2.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Most thermoelectric plants require water for cooling, many are therefore situated near rivers and coasts and thus vulnerable to flooding. Increases in water temperature or restrictions on cooling water availability affect hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants. A 1°C increase in the temperature of water used as coolant yields a decrease of 0.12–0.7% in power output (Mima and Criqui, 2015; Ibrahim, Ibrahim and Attia, 2014). Excess biological growth, accelerated by warmer water, increases risk of clogging water intakes (Cruz and Krausmann, 2013). While some regions are expected to experience increased capacity under climate change (namely India and Russia), global annual thermal power plant capacity is likely  to be reduced by between 7% in a mid-century RCP2.6 scenario and 12% in a mid-century RCP8.5 scenario (van Vliet et al., 2016). Worldwide, hydroelectric capacity reductions are projected at 0.4–6.1% (van Vliet et al., 2016). Analysis of the UK’s water for energy generation abstractions showed that an energy mix of high nuclear or carbon capture technologies could require as much as six times the current cooling water demands (Byers, Hall and Amezaga, 2014; Byers et al., 2016)."

Projected changes in wind and solar potential are uncertain; the trends vary by region and season (Burnett, Barbour and Harrison, 2014; Cradden et al., 2015; Fant, Schlosser and Strzepek, 2016). In an RCP8.5 scenario, Wild et al. (2015) conservatively calculate a global reduction of 1% per decade between 2005 and 2049 for future solar power production changes due to changing solar resources as a result of global warming and decreasing all-sky radiation over the coming decades.

wg2_ch06_6.2.4.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Electricity Transmission and Distribution. Electricity transmission and distribution networks span large distances, with overhead power lines often traversing exposed areas. Power lines and other assets, such as substations, are often located near population centres, including those in floodplains. Structural damage to overhead distribution lines will increase in areas projected to see more ice or freezing rain (e.g., most of Canada), snowfall (e.g., Japan) or wildfires (e.g., California, USA) (Bompard et al., 2013; Mitchell, 2013; Sathaye et al., 2013; Jeong et al., 2018; Ohba and Sugimoto, 2020). Electricity outages may last for prolonged periods of time and across vast areas, in addition to potentially disproportionately affecting poorer or more vulnerable communities. Increases in windstorm frequency and intensity increase the risk of direct damage to overhead lines and pylons, in many locations this is limited but Tyusov et al. (2017) calculate an increase as high as 30% in parts of Russia. Where the mode of failure is recorded, transmission pylons are seen to be more susceptible to wind damage, whilst distribution pylons are more likely  to be affected by treefall and debris (Karagiannis  et al., 2019). Increased temperatures can lead to the de-rating (lower performance) of power lines, whose resistance increases with temperature with efficiency reductions of 2–14% being projected by 2100 (Cradden and Harrison, 2013; Bartos et al., 2016)."

Extreme weather events impact extraction (onshore and offshore) and refining operations of petroleum, oil, coal, gas and biofuels. Disruption of road, rail and shipping routes (see Section 6.2.5.2) interrupts fuel supply chains. However, there are a number of risks that are specific to these sectors. Heat can lead to expansion in oil and gas pipes, increasing the risk of rupture (Sieber, 2013), whilst heatwaves and droughts can reduce the availability of biofuel (Moiseyev  et al., 2011; Schaeffer  et al., 2012). Subsidence and shrinkage of soils damages underground assets such as pipes intakes (Cruz and Krausmann, 2013), while additional human activity such as extractive drilling may induce earthquakes, as observed in the northern Dutch province of Groningen (Van der Voort and Vanclay, 2015). In Alaska, USA, the thaw of permafrost and subsequent ground instability is estimated to lead to USD 33 million damages to fuel pipelines in an end-of-century RCP8.5 scenario (Melvin  et al., 2017), with low-lying coastal deltas particularly vulnerable (Schmidt, 2015)."

Climate risks to transport infrastructure (from heat- and cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal floods, and windstorms) in Europe could rise from €0.5 billion to over €10 billion by the 2080s (Forzieri  et al., 2018). Across the Arctic, nearly four million people and 70% of all current infrastructure, including resource extraction and transportation routes, will be at risk by 2050 (Hjort  et al., 2018), although the design of specific infrastructure may also affect the degree of infrastructure damage, depending on local geological and ecological conditions. Globally, Koks et al. (2019) calculated that approximately 7.5% of road and railway assets are exposed to a 1-in-100 year flood events, and total global expected annual damages (EAD) of USD 3.1–22 billion (mean USD 14.6 billion) due to direct damage from cyclone winds, surface and river flooding, and coastal flooding. The majority of this is caused by surface water and fluvial flooding (mean USD 10.7 billion). Although twice as much infrastructure is exposed to cyclone winds compared with flooding, a mean EAD of USD 0.5 billion is significantly less than for coastal flooding (USD 2.3 billion), as cyclone damages are largely limited to bridge damage and the cost of removing trees fallen on road carriageways and railway tracks. This is small relative to global gross domestic product (GDP; ~0.02%). However, in some countries EAD equates to 0.5–1% of GDP, which is the same order of magnitude as typical national transport infrastructure budgets, but especially significant for countries such as Fiji that already spend 30% of their government budget on transport (World Bank Group, 2017). Koks et al. (2019) did not assess future climate change impacts, but comparable studies calculating changes in EAD from flooding based upon land use show increases of 170–1370%, depending on global greenhouse gas emissions levels (Alfieri  et al., 2017; Winsemius  et al., 2015). Moreover, Schweikert et al., (2014) report that climate risks to transport infrastructure could cost as much as 5% of annual road infrastructure budgets by 2100, with disproportionate impacts in some low and lower middle-income countries."

For instance, Pk et al. (2018) show this could lead to a 30% reduction in the engineering factor of safety of earth embankments in Southern Ontario (Canada). Increased river flows in many catchments will also increase failures from bridge scours (Forzieri  et al., 2018). HR Wallingford (2014) calculate that the projected 8% increase in scouring from high river flows in the UK will lead to 1 in 20 bridges being at high risk of failure by the 2080s, whilst in the USA the 129,000 bridges currently deficient could increase by 100,000 (Wright  et al., 2012). With respect to temperature, analysis by Forzieri et al. (2018) concludes that heatwaves will be the most significant risk to EU transport infrastructure in the 2080s, as a result of buckling of roads and railways due to thermal expansion, melting of road asphalt and softening of pavement material. In the USA, over 50% more roads will require rehabilitation (Mallick  et al., 2018), whilst USD 596 million will be required through 2050 to maintain and repair roads in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia (Chinowsky, Price and Neumann, 2013)."

A study from the USA showed that climate change will impact buildings by affecting peak and annual building energy consumption (Fri and Savitz, 2014). From an infrastructure standpoint, the vulnerability of current hydropower and thermoelectric power generation systems may change due to changes in climate and water systems and projected reduction of usable capacities (van Vliet et al., 2016; Byers et al., 2016).

A 1°C increase in the temperature of water used as coolant yields a decrease of 0.12–0.7% in power output (Mima and Criqui, 2015; Ibrahim, Ibrahim and Attia, 2014). Excess biological growth, accelerated by warmer water, increases risk of clogging water intakes (Cruz and Krausmann, 2013). While some regions are expected to experience increased capacity under climate change (namely India and Russia), global annual thermal power plant capacity is likely  to be reduced by between 7% in a mid-century RCP2.6 scenario and 12% in a mid-century RCP8.5 scenario (van Vliet et al., 2016). Worldwide, hydroelectric capacity reductions are projected at 0.4–6.1% (van Vliet et al., 2016).

Electricity outages may last for prolonged periods of time and across vast areas, in addition to potentially disproportionately affecting poorer or more vulnerable communities. Increases in windstorm frequency and intensity increase the risk of direct damage to overhead lines and pylons, in many locations this is limited but Tyusov et al. (2017) calculate an increase as high as 30% in parts of Russia. Where the mode of failure is recorded, transmission pylons are seen to be more susceptible to wind damage, whilst distribution pylons are more likely  to be affected by treefall and debris (Karagiannis  et al., 2019). Increased temperatures can lead to the de-rating (lower performance) of power lines, whose resistance increases with temperature with efficiency reductions of 2–14% being projected by 2100 (Cradden and Harrison, 2013; Bartos et al., 2016)."

Heat can lead to expansion in oil and gas pipes, increasing the risk of rupture (Sieber, 2013), whilst heatwaves and droughts can reduce the availability of biofuel (Moiseyev  et al., 2011; Schaeffer  et al., 2012). Subsidence and shrinkage of soils damages underground assets such as pipes intakes (Cruz and Krausmann, 2013), while additional human activity such as extractive drilling may induce earthquakes, as observed in the northern Dutch province of Groningen (Van der Voort and Vanclay, 2015).

Climate risks to transport infrastructure (from heat- and cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal floods, and windstorms) in Europe could rise from €0.5 billion to over €10 billion by the 2080s (Forzieri  et al., 2018). Across the Arctic, nearly four million people and 70% of all current infrastructure, including resource extraction and transportation routes, will be at risk by 2050 (Hjort  et al., 2018), although the design of specific infrastructure may also affect the degree of infrastructure damage, depending on local geological and ecological conditions. Globally, Koks et al. (2019) calculated that approximately 7.5% of road and railway assets are exposed to a 1-in-100 year flood events, and total global expected annual damages (EAD) of USD 3.1–22 billion (mean USD 14.6 billion) due to direct damage from cyclone winds, surface and river flooding, and coastal flooding. The majority of this is caused by surface water and fluvial flooding (mean USD 10.7 billion). Although twice as much infrastructure is exposed to cyclone winds compared with flooding, a mean EAD of USD 0.5 billion is significantly less than for coastal flooding (USD 2.3 billion), as cyclone damages are largely limited to bridge damage and the cost of removing trees fallen on road carriageways and railway tracks. This is small relative to global gross domestic product (GDP; ~0.02%). However, in some countries EAD equates to 0.5–1% of GDP, which is the same order of magnitude as typical national transport infrastructure budgets, but especially significant for countries such as Fiji that already spend 30% of their government budget on transport (World Bank Group, 2017). Koks et al. (2019) did not assess future climate change impacts, but comparable studies calculating changes in EAD from flooding based upon land use show increases of 170–1370%, depending on global greenhouse gas emissions levels (Alfieri  et al., 2017; Winsemius  et al., 2015).

For instance, Pk et al. (2018) show this could lead to a 30% reduction in the engineering factor of safety of earth embankments in Southern Ontario (Canada). Increased river flows in many catchments will also increase failures from bridge scours (Forzieri  et al., 2018). HR Wallingford (2014) calculate that the projected 8% increase in scouring from high river flows in the UK will lead to 1 in 20 bridges being at high risk of failure by the 2080s, whilst in the USA the 129,000 bridges currently deficient could increase by 100,000 (Wright  et al., 2012). With respect to temperature, analysis by Forzieri et al. (2018) concludes that heatwaves will be the most significant risk to EU transport infrastructure in the 2080s, as a result of buckling of roads and railways due to thermal expansion, melting of road asphalt and softening of pavement material. In the USA, over 50% more roads will require rehabilitation (Mallick  et al., 2018), whilst USD 596 million will be required through 2050 to maintain and repair roads in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia (Chinowsky, Price and Neumann, 2013)."

For example, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy led to total losses of up to USD 6.5 million to the New York City region’s low-lying salt marshes and beaches (Meixler, 2017). Research from coastal settlements across Catalonia, Spain, shows significant levels of tourism loss (which contribute to 11.1% of the region’s GDP), infrastructure damage and natural capital loss attributed to inundation and erosion of beaches, which are projected to retreat by −0.7 m yr −1 given current sea level rise projections of 0.53–1.75 m by 2100 (Jiménez  et al., 2017)."

Some may be sudden shocks from extreme weather events, which both threaten the facility, staff and patients and increase the number of people seeking health care. There are extensive reports of health facilities being damaged after major floods and windstorms (e.g., 2010 floods in Pakistan, Hurricane Sandy in the USA) which can be further exacerbated by power and water supply failures (Powell, Hanfling and Gostin, 2012). Disruption to services may persist for many months because of damage to buildings, loss of drugs and equipment, and damaged transport infrastructure significantly increasing travel time for patients (Hierink  et al., 2020). The impacts of climate change on the health of residents of ‘slum’ settlements will also compound the existing health burdens faced by these individuals, including infectious disease and other environmental public health concerns (Lilford  et al., 2016; Mberu  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Infrastructure networks are increasingly dependent on each other—for power, control (via ICT) and access for deliveries or servicing (Figure 6.2). Moreover, a range of other mechanisms can create interdependencies that impact upon climate risks by creating pathways for cascading failure (Undorf  et al., 2020; Barabási, 2013). In the UK, for example, all infrastructures utilities identify failure of components in another utility as a risk to their systems (Dawson  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,Key interdependencies include:
wg2_ch06_box-6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"There is usually limited information on the risks between infrastructure sectors. Without frameworks for collaboration, and coupled with commercial and security sensitivities, this remains a barrier to routine sharing and cooperation between operators. Despite this, methods to tackle interdependence in climate risk analysis are emerging (Dawson, 2015). For example, Thacker et al. (2017) analysed the criticality of the UK’s infrastructure networks by integrating data on infrastructure location, connectivity, interdependence and usage. The analysis showed that criticality hotspots are typically located around the periphery of urban areas where there are large facilities upon which many users depend or where several critical infrastructures are concentrated in one location. As infrastructure systems become increasingly interconnected, associated risks from climate change will increase and require a cross-sectoral approach to adaptation (Dawson et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Compound events can be initiated via hazards such as single extreme events, or multiple coincident events overlapping and interacting with exposed urban systems or sectors as compound climate risks (Leonard  et al., 2014; IPCC, 2019b; Piontek  et al., 2014). Hydrometeorological hazards, such as extreme precipitation from tropical cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms, often combine with storm surges and freshwater discharge leading to high compound risks at exposed settlements (Zheng, Westra and Sisson, 2013; Chen and Liu, 2014; Ourbak and Magnan, 2018; Dowdy and Catto, 2017). The compounding effect between these hydrometeorological hazards suggest that the combined impact of these events are greater than each of these variables on its own, and can amplify risks in affected settlements (Kew  et al., 2013; Vitousek  et al., 2017). These risks are concentrated in coastal cities exposed to sea level rise and severe storms (van den Hurk  et al., 2015; Wahl  et al., 2015; Paprotny  et al., 2018b; Lagmay  et al., 2015), or in settlements located in valleys prone to slope failure, such as the 2013 Uttarakhand floods and landslides arising from extreme precipitation and glacial lake outbursts along the Mandakini river in India (Ziegler  et al., 2016; Barata  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Cascading climate events occur when an extreme event triggers a sequence of secondary events within natural and human systems that causes additional physical, natural, social or economic disruption. The resulting impact can be significantly larger than the initial hazard (IPCC, 2019b). Each step in a risk cascade can generate direct (immediate impacts) and secondary (consequential impacts) losses. Risks from these cascading impacts are complex and multi-dimensional (Hao, Singh and Hao, 2018; Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017). For instance, combined droughts and heatwaves increases risks of urban water scarcity (Miralles  et al., 2019; Gillner, Bräuning and Roloff, 2014; Gill  et al., 2013), as well as increasing wildfire extent and lowering snowpack conditions that affected peri-urban settlements adjacent to forested areas, as observed in California during the 2014 drought (AghaKouchak  et al., 2014). Similarly, heatwaves can increase the risk of mortality associated with air pollution (see Section 7.2.2.5)."

Risks are complex and multi-dimensional, and can significantly amplify the impact of single events across space, scale and time. Impacts are determined by the magnitude of urban vulnerability and/or the interdependence of urban critical infrastructure (Pescaroli and Alexander, 2018; Zuccaro, De Gregorio and Leone, 2018). Poorer and wealthier settlements and cities are then both at risk from compound and cascading risks though potentially through contrasting mechanisms. For richer and poorer cities, managing climate risk as part of compound and cascading risks that can also include technological, biological and political risks places renewed emphasis on investment in generic capabilities that reduce vulnerability and on risk monitoring capability to track and respond to impacts across infrastructures and places (limited evidence, high agreement ). Considering climate risk and managing such risk as part of complex, compounding and/or cascading risks is in its infancy but rapidly being accepted as necessary, especially when considering the wider poverty and justice implications of climate change arising from differentiated vulnerability in cities."

wg2_ch06_6.2.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"The increased risk arises not just from greater exposure from climate events impacting cities, but is also magnified by low adaptive capacity that can arise from intra-urban variations in infrastructure quality. For instance, infrastructure within expanding informal settlements is associated with deficiency in materials, structural safety and a lack of accessibility. These areas are often located in the most risk-prone urban areas in developing nations that are vulnerable to compound hazards (Dawson  et al., 2018). Further, these risks can be exacerbated from complications arising from local versus national governance and/or regulations related to hazard management (Garschagen, 2016; Castán Broto, 2017)."

wg2_ch06_6.2.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Secondary impacts occurring sequentially after an extreme hazard can severely affect disaster management, especially in complex urban systems (robust evidence, high agreement ). Over time, relatively small perturbations can cascade outward from a primary failure, triggering further failures in other dependent parts of the network some distance away from the primary failure (Penny  et al., 2018). In some cities, such as those prone to compound flood hazards, these dependent network parts can be dams, levees or other critical flood protection infrastructure that are essential for managing these cascading risks (Serre and Heinzlef, 2018; Fekete, 2019). Failure of these infrastructure systems can result in sequential failures in urban transport (Zaidi, 2018), energy networks (Sharifi and Yamagata, 2016), urban biodiversity (Solecki and Marcotullio, 2013) and so-called na-tech disasters; when natural hazards trigger technological disasters (Girgin, Necci and Krausmann, 2019). This risk cascade can propagate more widely by stopping flows of people, goods and services, with economic consequences beyond urban areas (Wilbanks and Fernandez, 2014)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"Compound and cascading climate risks require a different way of accounting for cumulative hazard impacts in urban areas (medium evidence, high agreement ). There is emerging literature calling for analysis on interactions between individual and inter-related climate extremes with complex urban systems, so as to ascertain how urban and key infrastructural vulnerabilities can be identified and managed in a warming world (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; Gallina  et al., 2016; Moftakhari  et al., 2017; Zscheischler  et al., 2018; Baldwin  et al., 2019; Pescaroli and Alexander, 2018; Yin  et al., 2017; AghaKouchak  et al., 2020), as well as in managing adaptation for present and future pandemics, for example COVID-19 (Pelling  et al., 2021; Phillips  et al., 2020)."

Others also note the utility of a systems approach to analysing risks and benefits, including considerations of potential cascading ecological effects, full lifecycle environmental impacts, and unintended consequences, as well as possible co-benefits of responses (Ingwersen  et al., 2014). Lowering these risks requires urban stakeholders to reduce urban vulnerability by going beyond linear approaches to risk management (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch06_box-6.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Larger cities may be the most stable administrative entities in states affected by conflict. Even here, ability to plan and deliver adaptation can be hampered. Extending into urban areas within stable states, alienation and loss of trust between local populations and the state can be exacerbated by top-down adaptation planning and delivery; socially and spatially uneven adaptation investment; and in the economic and administrative limits of government that can lead to some places being excluded from formal planned investment (high confidence) (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). These pathways for exclusion can combine among already marginalised and low-income populations where trust in government agencies may already be low (Rodrigues, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change can be a threat multiplier in cities and urban regions, exacerbating existing human security tension (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Froese and Schilling, 2019; Flörke, Schneider and McDonald, 2018; Rajsekhar and Gorelick, 2017). Where conflict or administrative tensions extend beyond cities, adapting regional infrastructure systems that underpin urban life is challenging, for example where elements of networked infrastructure are under the control of conflicting political interests. This has been noted for the water sector (Tänzler, Maas and Carius, 2010). Coordinating political processes is a major challenge even for industrialised countries with adequate administrative capacity. In post-conflict societies, the difficulties of coordination for urban planning are disproportionately greater (Sovacool, Tan-Mullins and Abrahamse, 2018)."

Adaptation can provide a common goal reaching across political differences and be a part of building political trust and local cooperation between alienated communities (Tänzler, Maas and Carius, 2010). Peacebuilding programmes led by government or civil society are typically concerned with the short-term and framed by socioeconomic policy, integrating the longer-term view and engineering-technical expertise for adaptation is a challenge (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Ishiwatari, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.2.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Planning and implementing climate adaptation in cities and settlements can be hampered by incomplete scientific knowledge, a lack of awareness of cascading impacts (and residual risks), mismanagement of actions, human capacity and financing deficits, as well as opportunities for eroding long-term sustainable development priorities (Juhola  et al., 2016). These tensions can become acute in fragile and conflict affected states (see Box 6.3). It is important to differentiate between the climatic drivers of risk and social drivers that may compound risk exposures and experiences (Brown, 2014; Nightingale  et al., 2020), especially since technically- and scientifically-informed adaptation actions can be redirected depending on socioeconomic, political or cultural conditions on the ground (Eriksen, Nightingale and Eakin, 2015). The implementation of adaptation, whether by government, private sector or civil society actors, can therefore lead to unanticipated and unintended amplification of political, economic and ecological risks (Swatuk  et al., 2020). Many cities are still in the phase of piloting or testing out appropriate adaptation actions, although there is emerging consensus that adaptation plans and projects should acknowledge trade-offs, intentionally avoid past development mistakes, not lock-in detrimental impacts or further risks arising from implementation and explicitly anticipate the risks of maladaptation in decision making (Magnan  et al., 2016; Gajjar, Singh and Deshpande, 2019). Maladaptation describes actions that lead to increased vulnerability or risk to climate impacts or diminish welfare. Urban examples include green gentrification which offers nature-based solutions to the few, social safety nets that promote risk inducing subsidies. Whether an action is maladapted can depend on context, for example air conditioning can reduce risk for the individual but is maladaptive at a societal level (see Section 6.3.4.2). It is informed by process; corruption can distort processes and generate maladaptation (see Section 6.4.5.2). Climate resilient development raises the ambition for adaptation actions so that it is also possible to describe actions that do not also enhance climate mitigation and sustainable development outcomes as maladaptive (see Section 6.4.3.1). This section assesses three broad categories of risk arising from downstream adaptation actions, including interventions that transfer vulnerability across space and time, plans that yield socioeconomically exclusionary outcomes, and actions that undermine long-term sustainable and resilient development priorities."
wg2_ch06_6.2.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Downstream impacts occur because adaptive capacity is often unequally distributed across sectors and communities (Matin, Forrester and Ensor, 2018; Makondo and Thomas, 2018). In cities and settlements, adaptation interventions can displace ecological impacts to more vulnerable areas or directly lead to socioeconomically exclusionary outcomes (Anguelovski  et al., 2016), particularly when adaptation plans and actions are primarily assessed through the prism of economic and/or financial viability (Shi  et al., 2016; Klein, Juhola and Landauer, 2017). As a result, adaptation actions make only minimal contributions to the reduction of vulnerability, as the increased vulnerability of excluded communities more than offsets the decreased vulnerability of more well-off communities. Numerous examples, ranging from the mega coastal planning in Jakarta, Indonesia (Salim, Bettinger and Fisher, 2019; Goh, 2019), fragmentation of urban infrastructure intended to promote climate resilience in Manila, Philippines (Meerow, 2017), exclusionary modes of flood control in São Paulo, Brazil (Henrique and Tschakert, 2019), strategies to reduce risks in the event of mudslides in Sarno, Italy (D’Alisa and Kallis, 2016), and involuntary community relocations in Vietnam (Lindegaard, 2020) and Mozambique (Arnall, 2019) all point to how an economic logic to adaptation can lead to exclusion of lower income, informal or minority communities in adaptation."
wg2_ch06_6.2.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"A specific form of maladaptation is so-called green gentrification, this privileges wealthy urban residents in urban greening projects (Rice  et al., 2020; Shokry, Connolly and Anguelovski, 2020; Anguelovski, Irazábal-Zurita and Connolly, 2019; Blok, 2020). For example, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, researchers found that adaptation functionality had a positive effect on property values (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018). In New York City and Atlanta, Georgia, USA, research has shown that adaptation investments can increase property values and lead to neighbourhood change (Immergluck and Balan, 2018; Gould and Lewis, 2018). In the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast, South East Queensland, Australia, where local communities have a strong preference for waterfront living, local governments are pressured by property developers to protect these coastal zones (Torabi, Dedekorkut-Howes and Howes, 2018). In Lagos, Nigeria, efforts to achieve climate resilience and sustainability through future city practices risk perpetuating the enclosure and commodification of land (Ajibade, 2017). The exclusionary outcomes of some adaptation interventions can therefore further heighten the risk to communities that are socioeconomically more vulnerable. See Section 6.3 for further discussion of equity and justice considerations in local climate adaptation."
wg2_ch06_6.2.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"Human behaviour can exacerbate climate impacts, for example in the emergence of ‘last chance tourism’, Lemieux  et al. (2018) focused on built cultural heritage at risk from climate change associated events, including from decay or even total loss generated by increased flooding and sea level rise (Camuffo, Bertolin and Schenal, 2017) and water infiltration from post-flood standing water (Camuffo, 2019). Last chance tourism can lead to increased touristic interest over a short time horizon and to precarious economic conditions, which can lead to further accelerated degradation cultural heritage sites already at risk from climate change."
wg2_ch06_6.2.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"Finally, some adaptation policies or actions can erode the preconditions for sustainable and resilient development by indirectly increasing society’s vulnerability (Neset  et al., 2019; Juhola  et al., 2016). Mandates to mainstream adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates development-as-usual, reinforcing technocratic forms of local governance and locking in structural causes of marginalisation and differential vulnerability (Scoville-Simonds, Jamali and Hufty, 2020). Adaptation policy examples include: Australia’s adaptation policy focus on financial strategies, preference for business-as-usual scenarios and incremental change will not contribute to transformative change (Granberg and Glover, 2014); Surat, India, where a focus on adapting industries and economically important assets in the city can divert policy attention away from general social equity and urban sustainability priorities (Chu, 2016; Blok, 2020); Cambodia, where conflict between adaptation practitioners and local communities and non-compliance with regulatory safeguards led to conflict and potential for maladaptation (Work  et al., 2018). Finally, although insurance has the potential to incentivise practices to reduce risks, including through measures to reduce premiums (see Section 6.4.5 for additional details), researchers of insurance-led adaptation actions have argued that, since insurance regimes privilege normality, they tend to structurally embed risky behaviour and inhibit change (O’Hare, White and Connelly, 2016). All of these examples illustrate how incremental strategies that rely on business-as-usual actions can further entrench unequal and unsustainable development patterns in the long term. There are also significant limits to urban adaptation (see Section 6.4) with consequential impacts on human well-being."

It also provides adaptation options identified and elaborated on in Section 6.3 as having the highest potential for reducing the risk, and an assessment of the confidence in the judgement that this risk could become severe.

Key risks are ‘potentially’ severe because, while some could already be severe now, more typically they may become so over time because of changes in the nature of the climate-related hazards and/or of the exposure and/or vulnerability of societies or ecosystems to those hazards. They also may become severe owing to the adverse consequences of adaptation or mitigation responses to the risk."
wg2_ch06_6.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation pathways are composed of sequences of adaptation actions connected through collaborative learning with the possibility of enabling transformations in urban and infrastructure systems (Werners  et al., 2021). Individual adaptation actions co-evolve with risks (see Section 6.2) and development processes (Section 6.4) to compose more or less planned adaptation pathways that can include a range of unanticipated outcomes. This section engages with this complexity by approaching adaptation through the notion of infrastructure. The adaptation options for individual infrastructure systems are reviewed, and in Section 6.4 brought together through assessment of cross-cutting enabling conditions. Interpreted broadly, infrastructure includes the social systems, ecological systems and grey/physical systems that underpin safe, satisfying and productive life in the city and beyond (Grimm  et al., 2016). Social infrastructure includes housing, health, education, livelihoods and social safety nets, cultural heritage/institutions, disaster risk management and security and urban planning. Ecological infrastructure includes nature-based services: temperature regulation, flood protection and urban agriculture. Grey, or physical infrastructure, includes energy, transport, water and sanitation, communications (digital), built form and solid waste management. Framing infrastructure in this way enables an assessment of adaptation that is not constrained to the administrative boundaries of urban settlements, but also includes the flows of material, people and money between urban, peri-urban and more rural places, and can include adaptation actions deployed by government, individuals and the private sector. Recognising the complexity of adaptation and the research literature that reaches beyond individual infrastructural domains, the section also reviews urban adaptation through the cross-cutting lenses of equity and mitigation. Section 6.4 assesses the enabling environment (political will, governance, knowledge, finance and social context) that shapes specific adaptation contexts and futures."
wg2_ch06_6.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The adaptation gap is the difference between the ability to manage risk and loss and experienced risk and loss (Chen  et al., 2016; UNEP, 2021). It describes both levels of capacity and residual risk. Figure 6.4 presents an analysis by IPCC World Region for urban populations and current levels for risk and loss. The analysis seeks to draw out equity considerations by comparing the poorest and wealthiest quintiles for each region and for adaptation to the direct impacts of flooding and heatwave, as well as impacts felt in cities that include climate change impacts on supply chains; water and food security. Figure 6.4 should not be used to compare regions but can be used to contrast adaptation gaps by hazard type within regions."
wg2_ch06_6.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The key finding from Figure 6.4 is that for all urban populations, both currently deployed and currently planned adaptations are not able to meet current levels of risk associated with climate change.

This clearly emphasizes the fundamental importance of climate change mitigation to avoid urban risk and loss."
wg2_ch06_6.3.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The urban adaptation gap is also found to be unequal. The poorest quintile has a larger adaptation gap than the richest quintile. Reported inequality in the application of urban adaptation is greatest in North, East and Southeast Asia, reflecting rapid urbanisation in this region. Reported inequality is lowest in Europe and Australasia. Observed inequalities indicate that the markets, government actions and civil society investments available to reduce vulnerability and risk among the poor have not been observed to offset inequalities based on individual and household capacities."
wg2_ch06_6.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"There is some catch-up as analysis moves through actually deployed to planned and all conceivable deployment, particularly for water and food security, but even here, inequality in risk is not fully resolved. Africa and South and Central Asia in particular show considerable disparity in adaptation to urban food security even with all conceivable adaptation. This means that even if all available adaptation was to be deployed, inequality in ability to adapt to climate change would remain. This highlights the significance of addressing underlying inequalities in development that shape differential vulnerability (see Section 6.2.3.1, 6.2.3.3, 6.3.5.1 and 6.4) as part of vision and action on reducing risk to climate change so that no one is left behind."

wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Land use planning plays a major role in the siting of settlements and infrastructure. In relation to climate change, it affects whether development takes place in locations that are exposed to hazards; similarly, it shapes the potential effects that the built environment can have on natural systems. Despite this, generally speaking, there is limited implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts (robust evidence, high agreement ), see for example Maputo (Castán Broto, 2014), sub-Saharan cities (Dodman  et al., 2017) and Amman, Moscow and Delhi (Jabareen, 2015). Certain countries, such as South Korea, have, however, recently begun to address disaster risk reduction within their land use planning systems (Han  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Conventional zoning regulations (in which only one kind of use is permitted in a given area) and land use planning range in scale from the regional to the local and can be deployed to minimise risks through protection, accommodation or retreat. Protection entails, in addition to allocating zones for protective urban infrastructure (such as seawalls, levees and dykes, and slope revetments), avoidance measures that restrict or prevent urban development (e.g., through growth containment and/or no-build zones). Accommodation involves land use modifications and/or conversions while retreat requires either compulsory or voluntary relocations and may entail buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; León and March, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). Risk eliminating retreat measures are less widely adopted than other risk reducing zoning and land use measures (Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). This is attributed to the controversies of relocation and to the complexities of buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; King  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Evidence from both richer countries and the Global South reveals that conventional zoning is more effective when governance systems facilitate the implementation of land use policies for climate adaptation that preclude negative human-nature interactions and that curb spatial inequity, both of which can trigger climate gentrification and increase the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged groups to climate-related risk (high confidence) (Marks, 2015; Liotta  et al., 2020; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018). Cascading benefits of zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation are associated with the use of soft land cover, green infrastructure and improvement of livability through better conditions for walkability and cycling. This decreases auto-dependency and contributes to health and economic development (by attracting businesses and retail that stimulate economic prosperity and increase property values) (Larsen, 2015; Carter  et al., 2015). Such increases in property values have also been observed in zones and areas protected from risks (such as flooding), where it may trigger spatial inequity leading to climate gentrification (Marks, 2015; Votsis, 2017; Votsis and Perrels, 2016; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation actions through zoning and land use are more effective when combined with other planning measures (high confidence), for example with ecosystem-based adaptations (e.g., for flood management and curbing the urban heat island effect) (Larsen, 2015; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018; Nolon, 2016); with community-based adaptations (trade-offs and valuations, i.e., which land uses are valued more) (Larsen, 2015; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015; McPhearson  et al., 2018; Nolon, 2016); and with built form regulations and codes (León and March, 2016; Yiannakou and Salata, 2017; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Straka and Sodoudi, 2019; Larsen, 2015; Nolon, 2016). The imposition of planning-based tools such as scenario planning, flexible zoning and development incentivisation (among others) has the capacity to influence and encourage these adaptations (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). Local risk-reduction inputs can inform land use adaptation policies (accommodation and/or avoidance, specifically growth containment and no-build zones) that are better integrated within larger urban plans (Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018) (limited evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts remains limited (high agreement , robust evidence) owing to a range of challenges. A range of evidence from multiple locations indicates the challenges of mainstreaming land use planning for climate adaptation, including in Bangkok, Thailand (Marks, 2015), Legazpi City and Camalig Municipality in the Philippines (Cuevas  et al., 2016; Cuevas, 2016), the USA (Cuevas  et al., 2016; Cuevas, 2016), British Columbia, Canada (Stevens and Senbel, 2017), and Australia (Serrao-Neumann  et al., 2017). Mainstreaming is hindered by a lack of clarity of implementation strategies for climate adaptation, insufficient funding, competing priorities (especially among professional planners and politicians), institutional challenges (see Jabareen’s [2015] study of 20 cities globally) and the need to fill data gaps and continuously update weather statistics (Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement ). At the same time, however, limited evidence from cities around the world such as the urban regions of Stuttgart and Berlin in Germany (Larsen, 2015), Greater Manchester in the UK (Carter  et al., 2015), and Colombo in Sri Lanka (Perera and Emmanuel, 2018) reveals that risk reduction through zoning and land use can effectively protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect. This evidence points that one of the primary roles of land use planning is to guide the development of the urban form. As such, it underpins and establishes the basis for other infrastructure systems such as physical infrastructure and nature-based solutions (Morrissey, Moloney and Moore, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Understanding how livelihoods, particularly of the urban poor, are both impacted by climate risk and how they might be strengthened is central to understanding climate adaptation in cities and settlements (Dobson et al. 2015). Rapid urbanisation and expanding physical infrastructure do not have a clear relationship with improved outcomes for urban livelihoods of low-income residents (Soltesova  et al., 2014). Municipal and national efforts need to be closely aligned with building adaptive capacity of residents themselves, often through community-based adaptation (Soltesova  et al., 2014; Dobson, Nyamweru and Dodman, 2015). Social safety nets protect individuals or households from falling below a defined standard of living by providing cash, in kind and other social transfers to fight vulnerabilities (Islam and Hasan, 2019) including those associated with climate change impacts including food shocks. Strengthening the financial and social infrastructure of poor households is a critical component of adaptive and transformative capacity (Haque, Dodman and Hossain, 2014; Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016). Social safety nets are one mechanism for strengthening this capacity."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Social protection, or social security, is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent poverty and vulnerability throughout the lifecycle (ILO, 2017). Safety nets are intended to protect vulnerable households from impacts of economic shocks, natural hazards and disasters, and other crises. The UN policy frameworks for sustainable development, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, the new Strategic Framework 2018–2030 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UNFCCC, highlight the essential role of social protection in promoting comprehensive risk management (Aleksandrova, 2019). Since the term Adaptive Aocial Protection was introduced by the World Bank (2015) and the IPCC (2014), it has been an emerging strategic tool to integrate poverty reduction, disaster risk reduction and humanitarian development into adaptation to climate change (Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; Aleksandrova, 2019; Watson  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Adaptive social protection (ASP) is defined as a resilience-building approach by combining elements of social protection, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, so as to break the cycle of poverty and vulnerability of household by investing in their capacity to prepare for, cope with and adapt to all types of shocks, especially under climate change and other global challenges (Bowen  et al., 2020; Ivaschenko  et al., 2018). ASP has been justified as an effective instrument to build household and community resilience to climate extremes and slow-onset climate events such as sea level rise and environmental degradation (Schwan and Yu, 2018; Aleksandrova, 2019). In contexts of extreme poverty or climatic extremes, international development organisations, national provisions and market charities are complementary where family and kinship networks are weak and inadequate. To deal with short-term vulnerability to climate shocks, ASP can act as a crucial complement to risk management tools provided by communities and markets, tools which tend to be insufficient in the face of large or systemic shocks, by providing predictable transfers, developing human capital and diversifying livelihoods (Hallegatte  et al., 2016). ASP can also facilitate long-term change and adaptation by improving education and health levels, as well as providing a proactive approach to managing climate-induced migration in both rural and urban areas (Schwan and Yu, 2018; Adger  et al., 2014)."

ASP can contribute to both incremental and transformative interventions both at the system level (short-term and long-term coping strategies from communities) and at the beneficiaries’ level (vulnerable populations) (Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; World Bank, 2015; Aleksandrova, 2019; Ivaschenko  et al., 2018)."

wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"ASP may be very good at reducing extreme poverty by helping to meet individual or household needs but not collective needs to mitigate long-term climate shocks. For example, few programmes consider risk assessment and climate-proof infrastructures as anticipatory measures to foster early action and preparedness (Aleksandrova, 2019; Costella  et al., 2017). They therefore need to enable the adoption of forward-looking strategies for long-lasting adaptation (Tenzing, 2020). Some examples from China show social protection can improve adaptive capacity of urban communities with social medical insurance, housing subsidies, weather-index insurance, post-disaster construction, relocation planning, livelihood shift strategies, and so on. (Pan  et al., 2015; Zheng  et al., 2018b; Rao and Li, 2019; Song, Zheng and Lin, 2021). However, social protection may lead to maladaptation in urban policy when social security, or similar tools (for example insurance) to compensate for exposure deincentivise risk reduction (Grove, 2021). In many developing countries, high concentrations of poor and vulnerable groups living in disaster-prone zones of urban centres, new urban dwellers and informal residents are often excluded from community-based networks and social services (Aleksandrova, 2019). Risk transfer tools (such as insurance) and risk retention measures (such as social safety nets) can avoid and minimise the burden of loss and damage and limit secondary and indirect effects (Aleksandrova, 2019; Roberts and Pelling, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Inclusive, targeted, responsive and equitable social protection can support long-term transition toward more sustainable, adaptive and resilient societies (Hallegatte  et al., 2016; Shi  et al., 2018; Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; Carter and Janzen, 2018; Adger  et al., 2014). ASP systems can be cost effective and equitable when targeting accuracy, timely risk sharing (disaster assistance) and improved policy coherence. Carter and Janzen (2018) find that the long-term level and depth of poverty can be improved by incorporating vulnerability targeted social protection into a conventional social protection system. Countries at all income levels can set up ASP systems that increase resilience to natural hazards, but the systems need to identify cost–benefits and be scalable and flexible to adjust to future, increasing climate risk. Bastagli (2014) suggested a new design for effective social protection including: (i) increasing the amount or value of transfer; (ii) extending the coverage of beneficiaries; and (iii) introducing payments or new programmes of social protections. For social protection programmes to contribute more effectively to adaptation, they need to be better coordinated across a range of agencies; better integrated with climate data to anticipate times of need for vulnerable groups; and better aligned with other risk management instruments such as insurance (Agrawal  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is growing evidence of the benefits of early warning systems for urban preparedness decision making and action for climate and weather-related hazards such as cyclones, hurricanes and floods (medium evidence; high agreement ) (Lumbroso, Brown and Ranger, 2016; Zia and Wagner, 2015; Marchezini  et al., 2017). Climate forecasting is constantly evolving and becoming increasingly accurate. Global organisations such as the World Meteorological Organizations are increasingly focusing on new and emerging technologies such as crowdsourced data collection to support integrated city services and early warning systems (Baklanov  et al., 2018). However, while climate forecasting is an increasingly central tool for risk management agencies, a focus on urban areas or key infrastructure is still considerably rare (Lourenço  et al., 2015; Nissan  et al., 2019; Harvey  et al., 2019). The significant rise in urban risks poses significant challenges to humanitarian agencies. Humanitarian responses and local emergency management are vital for disaster risk reduction yet are compromised in urban contexts where it is difficult to confirm property ownership and where renters and informal dwellers are often excluded from decision-making and planning (Parker and Maynard, 2015; Maynard  et al., 2017). Disaster survivors and growing urban refugee populations are often displaced across the city thereby complicating efforts to track and provide support (Maynard  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Existing early warning systems remain insufficient and the complexity of urban landforms makes accurate and detailed early warning difficult (medium evidence; high agreement ) (Jones  et al., 2015). This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where urban centres are often characterised by rapid expansion of interlinked formal and informal human settlements and land use zones. In such contexts, early warning services vary in effectiveness within the same urban centre (Allen  et al., 2020c; Rangwala  et al., 2018). Often, forecast-based action follows linear structures where forecast information is applied mainly for responding to negative impacts rather than anticipatory decision-making and preparation to avoid such impacts (Marchezini  et al., 2017). Early warning systems are effective for warning of threshold breaching events including cyclonic activity and riverine flooding but less able to provide localised warning, though capability is rapidly increasing. Probabilistic risk forecasting and forecast based early action are only beginning to be applied to urban contexts and often those that are most vulnerable do not receive warnings regarding hazardous events (Nissan  et al., 2019). There is less capacity for early warning systems in LMICs with key challenges linked to a lack of well-established risk baseline information; accessibility, communication and understanding of forecast information, as well as political and institutional barriers and limited resources and capacities to act on such information (Jones  et al., 2015; Mustafa  et al., 2015; Zia and Wagner, 2015; Marchezini  et al., 2017; Gotgelf, Roggero and Eisenack, 2020). Political and institutional barriers to the incorporation of climate information to decision-making are not limited to LMICs (Harvey  et al., 2019). For example, comprehensive studies on sectoral use of climate information in Europe revealed that, despite climate services becoming increasingly accessible and well resourced, there is limited organisational uptake of seasonal climate forecasts across key sectors (e.g., energy, transport, water and infrastructure) in informing their decision making processes (Soares and Dessai, 2016; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018). This is due both to technical and non-technical barriers such as lack of awareness and knowledge of climate information and forecasting (Soares and Dessai, 2016; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Globally, a considerable diversity of tools and frameworks for urban resilience assessments are being developed at multiple scales (Arup and Rockefeller, 2015; Elias-Trostmann  et al., 2018). These include hybrids such as ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) (Begum  et al., 2014).While important advances have been made in assessing urban resilience, much debate remains around such tools and assessment approaches regarding issues such as validation, dynamics in exposure and vulnerability, and appropriateness of generic methods in high-density urban settlements (Leitner  et al., 2018; Cardoso  et al., 2020; Rufat  et al., 2019). Disaster impact and recovery time are strongly influenced by the behaviour and actions of individuals, communities, businesses, and government organisations (Meriläinen, 2020; Räsänen  et al., 2020). For example, the review by Aaerts et al. (2018) shows how the limitations of existing flood risk assessment methods (which tend to account for human behaviour in limited terms) can be addressed through innovative flood-risk assessments that integrate behavioural adaptation dynamics. The study by Moghadas et al. (2019) highlights the importance of hybrid multi-criteria approaches for assessing urban flood resilience in Tehran, Iran. A growing literature shows how multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches that include Local knowledge can achieve greater accuracy in risk characterisation and support lasting impact of investments into more robust climate services (Aerts  et al., 2018; Lourenço  et al., 2015; Sword-Daniels  et al., 2018; Singh  et al., 2018; Nissan  et al., 2019; Harvey  et al., 2019; Simon and Palmer, 2020). This literature highlights the need for innovative approaches in urban contexts that transcend traditional approaches of local knowledge inclusion widely applied in rural contexts, such as participatory rural appraisal."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The inclusion of Local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge in urban vulnerability and risk assessments can strongly enhance local resilience, but its effectiveness is constrained by wider decision making and policy contexts dominated by top-down approaches (medium evidence; high agreement ) (Jones  et al., 2015; Sword-Daniels  et al., 2018; Nissan  et al., 2019). Established non-state actors such as Shack and Slum Dwellers International are particularly effective at implementing inclusive approaches for local knowledge incorporation into urban decision-making. Climate change and disaster risk exacerbate existing problems of economic development, yet macro-economic planning seldom incorporates adaptation. Recent evidence also confirms the role of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in management practices to reduce climate risks through early warning preparedness and response (see also Section 6.3.2.3). These practices are particularly important where alternative early warning methods are absent. For instance, Abudu Kasei et al. (2019) show that Indigenous knowledge gathered through observations on changes in natural indicators (such as links between rainfall patterns, certain flora and fauna, and temperature changes) could be applied to develop early warning of climate hazards (floods and droughts) in informal urban settlements in African countries such as Ghana. Similarly, Hiwaski et al. (2015) show that observations of changes in the environment and celestial bodies are used to predict climate-related hazards in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste where communities in turn use local materials and methods, and customary practices to respond to the impacts of climate change."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism for middle- and high-income countries, yet is less widely available in LMICs (Surminski and Thieken, 2017). Additionally, where insurance options do exist in LMICs, these are not usually available to large populations living or operating in the informal sector. Flood insurance is widely available in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries but the demand and uptake differ significantly across countries (Hanger  et al., 2018). This financial tool is subject to increasing pressure under the changing climate, with growing concerns around affordability and availability. More integrative approaches are required, such as where changes in the insurance industry are closely linked to adaptation strategies, building standards and land use planning and their application (Cremades  et al., 2018). This is particularly important in LMICs and of central concern for all insurance schemes is ensuring access, fairness and affordability for the most poor and vulnerable. However, there are some notable examples of low-income communities setting up their own disaster insurance mechanisms. For example, the Community Development Funds for the Baan Mankong upgrading programme in Thailand include disaster funds as insurance against housing damage (Archer, 2012). Such approaches also need to be more closely linked to existing urban risk management planning approaches where urban livelihoods are seldom integrated and informed by more dynamic risk reduction frameworks that consider adaptive cycles and how resilience changes over time (Beringer and Kaewsuk, 2018; Cremades  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Disaster risk management systems face increasing challenges in adapting to evolving risk profiles, shaped by expanding urban areas and changing environmental conditions associated with climate change. In addition to flooding, risk monitoring and management systems have recently shown considerable shortfalls in planning for and responding to increased fire risk such as the devastating Californian wildfires in October 2019 (Morley, 2020) and Australia’s unprecedented and catastrophic 2019–2020 wildfire season. Risk management has also been challenged by new risk experiences including wild/bush fires encroaching on expanding urban areas and fire outbreaks in densely populated informal settlements pose increasing threats to livelihoods, human health and habitats globally (see also Sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.5.5.2)."

Cardiovascular fitness for example is a root cause of morbidity and mortality form heat stress (Schuster  et al., 2017). The World Health Organization has developed a framework of climate-resilient health systems that addresses both mitigation and adaptation goals (WHO, 2015). Universal health coverage (UHC) is an essential component of climate-resilient health systems. In most countries, access to health services is better in urban than in rural areas. However, there remain large urban populations with insufficient coverage of health services (WHO and WB, 2015) and UHC tracking needs to take better account of inequalities in coverage, including differences in access within cities and further disaggregation of urban populations by income. Thus, health sector investment is an important tool in adaptive action and capacity. Analyses of health survey data shows that, globally, access to health care is increasing toward UHC targets (Lozano  et al., 2020). Financing for global health has increased steadily in the last two decades and modelling shows this trend is likely  to continue to 2050, but at a slower pace of growth and the current disparities in per-capita health spending persist between high and low/middle income countries, leading to insufficient health service coverage for the poorest populations (Chang  et al., 2019a). Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial in LMIC and will remain the only means to access health care for many poor urban populations."

Improved building design and spatial urban planning (where facilities are located) are essential to increase resilience for higher temperature and flood risk (medium evidence; high agreement ) (WHO, 2021; Codjoe et al., 2020; Korah and Cobbinah, 2017).

Knowledge systems include formal educational provision (capital assets, syllabus and human capital), informal learning based in social interaction and customary institutions (including through social media) and public communication (news media, government and other information systems including commercial messaging). There is a growing body of literature addressing the role of information and communication technology in shaping behaviour in disaster response and recovery and climate action, with particular focus on social media use and serious gaming (Houston  et al., 2015; Carson  et al., 2018) (see Section 6.3.4.3)"

Universities and think tanks, as well as the third and private sector are key support mechanisms, particularly at the local level and when working in collaboration with local government and communities. They can support the development of critical educational resources and innovative communication methods, as well as facilitate the design and implementation of climate policies and related action plans."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Youth, adult communities, social media and the commercial media can have a significant impact on advancing climate awareness and the legitimacy of adaptive action, particularly in large urban areas (medium evidence, high agreement ). Climate change education in urban settlements has increasingly focused on enhancing children and young people’s political agency in schools, universities, and in formal and informal media settings (Cutter-Mackenzie and Rousell, 2019). However, an ambiguous framing of climate impacts and adaptation, for example around the science of urban heat islands by the media, can also exacerbate local community confusion and uncertainty (Iping  et al., 2019) and further training and capacity building opportunities such as for vocational qualifications is still required across diverse settings (Simmons, 2021). Communication strategies deployed in formal education and social media can be highly influential in exchanging information and establishing narratives and viewpoints that frame what adaptive action is legitimate, especially in large cities (Simpson, Napawan and Snyder, 2019). However, the effectiveness of communication strategies for change, for example from Mayoral offices, can also be influenced by wider political and structural drivers including community literacy or political partisanship (Boussalis, Coan and Holman, 2019). Recent research (e.g., Macintyre  et al., 2018) highlights the need for new learning approaches to climate education from school age to adult education. Emphasis is on inclusivity in learning and recognising diverse perspectives across multiple levels and settings, from formal and informal education to wider social learning. Informal learning that takes place outside of school settings, such as in libraries and botanical gardens, in everyday life is increasingly recognised as a key arena for climate education, life-long learning and nurturing environmental citizenship and activism (Paraskeva-Hadjichambi  et al., 2020)."

However, urban cultural policies are still limited, for example, Cape Town is the only African city to have developed a city-level cultural policy (Sitas, 2020). Cultural heritage refers to both tangible (e.g., historic buildings and sites) and intangible (e.g., oral traditions and social practices) resources inherited from the past (Fatorić and Egberts, 2020; Jackson, Dugmore and Riede, 2018). Learning about past societal and environment changes through heritage offers opportunity for reflection and transfer of knowledge and skills. This takes place in multiple contexts such as museums and cultural landscapes, and in everyday life (Fatorić and Egberts, 2020; Jackson, Dugmore and Riede, 2018). Cultural heritage is primarily associated with identity and is closely intertwined with the complexities of history, politics, economics and memory. Climate change adds another layer of complexity to cultural heritage and resource management (Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017b). Changing climatic conditions are already negatively impacting World Heritage Sites such as the Cordilleras’ Rice Terraces of the Philippines and earthen architecture sites, for example the Djenné mosque in Mali, are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and water interactions (UNESCO, 2021). Climate change impacts intangible cultural heritage across diverse settings such as in the Caribbean and Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) where traditional ways of life and related aspects such as oral traditions and performing arts are under threat from extreme weather events (UNESCO, 2021)."

To date, however, evidence indicates that adaptation actions prioritise archaeological sites (Carmichael  et al., 2017; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2018; Pollard  et al., 2014; Dawson, 2013). The efficacy of adaptation of historic buildings can be increased through increased and stable funding, incentives, stakeholder engagement, and legal and political frameworks (Dutra  et al., 2017; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2018; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017b; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017a; Leijonhufvud, 2016; Phillips, 2015; Sesana  et al., 2019; Sesana  et al., 2018; Sitas, 2020)."

Despite challenges associated with intangibility, socio-cultural heritage such as Indigenous knowledge (e.g., food security and water management practices) presents important opportunities for climate adaptation and resilience building.

Accommodation involves land use modifications and/or conversions while retreat requires either compulsory or voluntary relocations and may entail buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; León and March, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). Risk eliminating retreat measures are less widely adopted than other risk reducing zoning and land use measures (Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018).

wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Evidence from both richer countries and the Global South reveals that conventional zoning is more effective when governance systems facilitate the implementation of land use policies for climate adaptation that preclude negative human-nature interactions and that curb spatial inequity, both of which can trigger climate gentrification and increase the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged groups to climate-related risk (high confidence) (Marks, 2015; Liotta  et al., 2020; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018). Cascading benefits of zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation are associated with the use of soft land cover, green infrastructure and improvement of livability through better conditions for walkability and cycling. This decreases auto-dependency and contributes to health and economic development (by attracting businesses and retail that stimulate economic prosperity and increase property values) (Larsen, 2015; Carter  et al., 2015). Such increases in property values have also been observed in zones and areas protected from risks (such as flooding), where it may trigger spatial inequity leading to climate gentrification (Marks, 2015; Votsis, 2017; Votsis and Perrels, 2016; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation actions through zoning and land use are more effective when combined with other planning measures (high confidence), for example with ecosystem-based adaptations (e.g., for flood management and curbing the urban heat island effect) (Larsen, 2015; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018; Nolon, 2016); with community-based adaptations (trade-offs and valuations, i.e., which land uses are valued more) (Larsen, 2015; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015; McPhearson  et al., 2018; Nolon, 2016); and with built form regulations and codes (León and March, 2016; Yiannakou and Salata, 2017; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Straka and Sodoudi, 2019; Larsen, 2015; Nolon, 2016). The imposition of planning-based tools such as scenario planning, flexible zoning and development incentivisation (among others) has the capacity to influence and encourage these adaptations (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). Local risk-reduction inputs can inform land use adaptation policies (accommodation and/or avoidance, specifically growth containment and no-build zones) that are better integrated within larger urban plans (Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018) (limited evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts remains limited (high agreement , robust evidence) owing to a range of challenges. A range of evidence from multiple locations indicates the challenges of mainstreaming land use planning for climate adaptation, including in Bangkok, Thailand (Marks, 2015), Legazpi City and Camalig Municipality in the Philippines (Cuevas  et al., 2016; Cuevas, 2016), the USA (Cuevas  et al., 2016; Cuevas, 2016), British Columbia, Canada (Stevens and Senbel, 2017), and Australia (Serrao-Neumann  et al., 2017). Mainstreaming is hindered by a lack of clarity of implementation strategies for climate adaptation, insufficient funding, competing priorities (especially among professional planners and politicians), institutional challenges (see Jabareen’s [2015] study of 20 cities globally) and the need to fill data gaps and continuously update weather statistics (Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement ). At the same time, however, limited evidence from cities around the world such as the urban regions of Stuttgart and Berlin in Germany (Larsen, 2015), Greater Manchester in the UK (Carter  et al., 2015), and Colombo in Sri Lanka (Perera and Emmanuel, 2018) reveals that risk reduction through zoning and land use can effectively protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect. This evidence points that one of the primary roles of land use planning is to guide the development of the urban form. As such, it underpins and establishes the basis for other infrastructure systems such as physical infrastructure and nature-based solutions (Morrissey, Moloney and Moore, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Understanding how livelihoods, particularly of the urban poor, are both impacted by climate risk and how they might be strengthened is central to understanding climate adaptation in cities and settlements (Dobson et al. 2015). Rapid urbanisation and expanding physical infrastructure do not have a clear relationship with improved outcomes for urban livelihoods of low-income residents (Soltesova  et al., 2014). Municipal and national efforts need to be closely aligned with building adaptive capacity of residents themselves, often through community-based adaptation (Soltesova  et al., 2014; Dobson, Nyamweru and Dodman, 2015). Social safety nets protect individuals or households from falling below a defined standard of living by providing cash, in kind and other social transfers to fight vulnerabilities (Islam and Hasan, 2019) including those associated with climate change impacts including food shocks. Strengthening the financial and social infrastructure of poor households is a critical component of adaptive and transformative capacity (Haque, Dodman and Hossain, 2014; Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016). Social safety nets are one mechanism for strengthening this capacity."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Social protection, or social security, is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent poverty and vulnerability throughout the lifecycle (ILO, 2017). Safety nets are intended to protect vulnerable households from impacts of economic shocks, natural hazards and disasters, and other crises. The UN policy frameworks for sustainable development, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, the new Strategic Framework 2018–2030 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UNFCCC, highlight the essential role of social protection in promoting comprehensive risk management (Aleksandrova, 2019). Since the term Adaptive Aocial Protection was introduced by the World Bank (2015) and the IPCC (2014), it has been an emerging strategic tool to integrate poverty reduction, disaster risk reduction and humanitarian development into adaptation to climate change (Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; Aleksandrova, 2019; Watson  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Adaptive social protection (ASP) is defined as a resilience-building approach by combining elements of social protection, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, so as to break the cycle of poverty and vulnerability of household by investing in their capacity to prepare for, cope with and adapt to all types of shocks, especially under climate change and other global challenges (Bowen  et al., 2020; Ivaschenko  et al., 2018). ASP has been justified as an effective instrument to build household and community resilience to climate extremes and slow-onset climate events such as sea level rise and environmental degradation (Schwan and Yu, 2018; Aleksandrova, 2019). In contexts of extreme poverty or climatic extremes, international development organisations, national provisions and market charities are complementary where family and kinship networks are weak and inadequate. To deal with short-term vulnerability to climate shocks, ASP can act as a crucial complement to risk management tools provided by communities and markets, tools which tend to be insufficient in the face of large or systemic shocks, by providing predictable transfers, developing human capital and diversifying livelihoods (Hallegatte  et al., 2016). ASP can also facilitate long-term change and adaptation by improving education and health levels, as well as providing a proactive approach to managing climate-induced migration in both rural and urban areas (Schwan and Yu, 2018; Adger  et al., 2014)."

ASP instruments can be classified into four major types as presented in Table 6.5 (Ivaschenko  et al., 2018; ILO, 2017). ASP can contribute to both incremental and transformative interventions both at the system level (short-term and long-term coping strategies from communities) and at the beneficiaries’ level (vulnerable populations) (Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; World Bank, 2015; Aleksandrova, 2019; Ivaschenko  et al., 2018)."

wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"ASP may be very good at reducing extreme poverty by helping to meet individual or household needs but not collective needs to mitigate long-term climate shocks. For example, few programmes consider risk assessment and climate-proof infrastructures as anticipatory measures to foster early action and preparedness (Aleksandrova, 2019; Costella  et al., 2017). They therefore need to enable the adoption of forward-looking strategies for long-lasting adaptation (Tenzing, 2020). Some examples from China show social protection can improve adaptive capacity of urban communities with social medical insurance, housing subsidies, weather-index insurance, post-disaster construction, relocation planning, livelihood shift strategies, and so on. (Pan  et al., 2015; Zheng  et al., 2018b; Rao and Li, 2019; Song, Zheng and Lin, 2021). However, social protection may lead to maladaptation in urban policy when social security, or similar tools (for example insurance) to compensate for exposure deincentivise risk reduction (Grove, 2021). In many developing countries, high concentrations of poor and vulnerable groups living in disaster-prone zones of urban centres, new urban dwellers and informal residents are often excluded from community-based networks and social services (Aleksandrova, 2019). Risk transfer tools (such as insurance) and risk retention measures (such as social safety nets) can avoid and minimise the burden of loss and damage and limit secondary and indirect effects (Aleksandrova, 2019; Roberts and Pelling, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Inclusive, targeted, responsive and equitable social protection can support long-term transition toward more sustainable, adaptive and resilient societies (Hallegatte  et al., 2016; Shi  et al., 2018; Béné, Cornelius and Howland, 2018; Carter and Janzen, 2018; Adger  et al., 2014). ASP systems can be cost effective and equitable when targeting accuracy, timely risk sharing (disaster assistance) and improved policy coherence. Carter and Janzen (2018) find that the long-term level and depth of poverty can be improved by incorporating vulnerability targeted social protection into a conventional social protection system. Countries at all income levels can set up ASP systems that increase resilience to natural hazards, but the systems need to identify cost–benefits and be scalable and flexible to adjust to future, increasing climate risk. Bastagli (2014) suggested a new design for effective social protection including: (i) increasing the amount or value of transfer; (ii) extending the coverage of beneficiaries; and (iii) introducing payments or new programmes of social protections. For social protection programmes to contribute more effectively to adaptation, they need to be better coordinated across a range of agencies; better integrated with climate data to anticipate times of need for vulnerable groups; and better aligned with other risk management instruments such as insurance (Agrawal  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is growing evidence of the benefits of early warning systems for urban preparedness decision making and action for climate and weather-related hazards such as cyclones, hurricanes and floods (medium evidence; high agreement ) (Lumbroso, Brown and Ranger, 2016; Zia and Wagner, 2015; Marchezini  et al., 2017). Climate forecasting is constantly evolving and becoming increasingly accurate. Global organisations such as the World Meteorological Organizations are increasingly focusing on new and emerging technologies such as crowdsourced data collection to support integrated city services and early warning systems (Baklanov  et al., 2018). However, while climate forecasting is an increasingly central tool for risk management agencies, a focus on urban areas or key infrastructure is still considerably rare (Lourenço  et al., 2015; Nissan  et al., 2019; Harvey  et al., 2019). The significant rise in urban risks poses significant challenges to humanitarian agencies. Humanitarian responses and local emergency management are vital for disaster risk reduction yet are compromised in urban contexts where it is difficult to confirm property ownership and where renters and informal dwellers are often excluded from decision-making and planning (Parker and Maynard, 2015; Maynard  et al., 2017). Disaster survivors and growing urban refugee populations are often displaced across the city thereby complicating efforts to track and provide support (Maynard  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Existing early warning systems remain insufficient and the complexity of urban landforms makes accurate and detailed early warning difficult (medium evidence; high agreement ) (Jones  et al., 2015). This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where urban centres are often characterised by rapid expansion of interlinked formal and informal human settlements and land use zones. In such contexts, early warning services vary in effectiveness within the same urban centre (Allen  et al., 2020c; Rangwala  et al., 2018). Often, forecast-based action follows linear structures where forecast information is applied mainly for responding to negative impacts rather than anticipatory decision-making and preparation to avoid such impacts (Marchezini  et al., 2017). Early warning systems are effective for warning of threshold breaching events including cyclonic activity and riverine flooding but less able to provide localised warning, though capability is rapidly increasing. Probabilistic risk forecasting and forecast based early action are only beginning to be applied to urban contexts and often those that are most vulnerable do not receive warnings regarding hazardous events (Nissan  et al., 2019). There is less capacity for early warning systems in LMICs with key challenges linked to a lack of well-established risk baseline information; accessibility, communication and understanding of forecast information, as well as political and institutional barriers and limited resources and capacities to act on such information (Jones  et al., 2015; Mustafa  et al., 2015; Zia and Wagner, 2015; Marchezini  et al., 2017; Gotgelf, Roggero and Eisenack, 2020). Political and institutional barriers to the incorporation of climate information to decision-making are not limited to LMICs (Harvey  et al., 2019). For example, comprehensive studies on sectoral use of climate information in Europe revealed that, despite climate services becoming increasingly accessible and well resourced, there is limited organisational uptake of seasonal climate forecasts across key sectors (e.g., energy, transport, water and infrastructure) in informing their decision making processes (Soares and Dessai, 2016; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018). This is due both to technical and non-technical barriers such as lack of awareness and knowledge of climate information and forecasting (Soares and Dessai, 2016; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Globally, a considerable diversity of tools and frameworks for urban resilience assessments are being developed at multiple scales (Arup and Rockefeller, 2015; Elias-Trostmann  et al., 2018). These include hybrids such as ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) (Begum  et al., 2014).While important advances have been made in assessing urban resilience, much debate remains around such tools and assessment approaches regarding issues such as validation, dynamics in exposure and vulnerability, and appropriateness of generic methods in high-density urban settlements (Leitner  et al., 2018; Cardoso  et al., 2020; Rufat  et al., 2019). Disaster impact and recovery time are strongly influenced by the behaviour and actions of individuals, communities, businesses, and government organisations (Meriläinen, 2020; Räsänen  et al., 2020). For example, the review by Aaerts et al. (2018) shows how the limitations of existing flood risk assessment methods (which tend to account for human behaviour in limited terms) can be addressed through innovative flood-risk assessments that integrate behavioural adaptation dynamics. The study by Moghadas et al. (2019) highlights the importance of hybrid multi-criteria approaches for assessing urban flood resilience in Tehran, Iran. A growing literature shows how multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches that include Local knowledge can achieve greater accuracy in risk characterisation and support lasting impact of investments into more robust climate services (Aerts  et al., 2018; Lourenço  et al., 2015; Sword-Daniels  et al., 2018; Singh  et al., 2018; Nissan  et al., 2019; Harvey  et al., 2019; Simon and Palmer, 2020). This literature highlights the need for innovative approaches in urban contexts that transcend traditional approaches of local knowledge inclusion widely applied in rural contexts, such as participatory rural appraisal."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"The inclusion of Local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge in urban vulnerability and risk assessments can strongly enhance local resilience, but its effectiveness is constrained by wider decision making and policy contexts dominated by top-down approaches (medium evidence; high agreement ) (Jones  et al., 2015; Sword-Daniels  et al., 2018; Nissan  et al., 2019). Established non-state actors such as Shack and Slum Dwellers International are particularly effective at implementing inclusive approaches for local knowledge incorporation into urban decision-making. Climate change and disaster risk exacerbate existing problems of economic development, yet macro-economic planning seldom incorporates adaptation. Recent evidence also confirms the role of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in management practices to reduce climate risks through early warning preparedness and response (see also Section 6.3.2.3). These practices are particularly important where alternative early warning methods are absent. For instance, Abudu Kasei et al. (2019) show that Indigenous knowledge gathered through observations on changes in natural indicators (such as links between rainfall patterns, certain flora and fauna, and temperature changes) could be applied to develop early warning of climate hazards (floods and droughts) in informal urban settlements in African countries such as Ghana. Similarly, Hiwaski et al. (2015) show that observations of changes in the environment and celestial bodies are used to predict climate-related hazards in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste where communities in turn use local materials and methods, and customary practices to respond to the impacts of climate change."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism for middle- and high-income countries, yet is less widely available in LMICs (Surminski and Thieken, 2017). Additionally, where insurance options do exist in LMICs, these are not usually available to large populations living or operating in the informal sector. Flood insurance is widely available in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries but the demand and uptake differ significantly across countries (Hanger  et al., 2018). This financial tool is subject to increasing pressure under the changing climate, with growing concerns around affordability and availability. More integrative approaches are required, such as where changes in the insurance industry are closely linked to adaptation strategies, building standards and land use planning and their application (Cremades  et al., 2018). This is particularly important in LMICs and of central concern for all insurance schemes is ensuring access, fairness and affordability for the most poor and vulnerable. However, there are some notable examples of low-income communities setting up their own disaster insurance mechanisms. For example, the Community Development Funds for the Baan Mankong upgrading programme in Thailand include disaster funds as insurance against housing damage (Archer, 2012). Such approaches also need to be more closely linked to existing urban risk management planning approaches where urban livelihoods are seldom integrated and informed by more dynamic risk reduction frameworks that consider adaptive cycles and how resilience changes over time (Beringer and Kaewsuk, 2018; Cremades  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Disaster risk management systems face increasing challenges in adapting to evolving risk profiles, shaped by expanding urban areas and changing environmental conditions associated with climate change. In addition to flooding, risk monitoring and management systems have recently shown considerable shortfalls in planning for and responding to increased fire risk such as the devastating Californian wildfires in October 2019 (Morley, 2020) and Australia’s unprecedented and catastrophic 2019–2020 wildfire season. Risk management has also been challenged by new risk experiences including wild/bush fires encroaching on expanding urban areas and fire outbreaks in densely populated informal settlements pose increasing threats to livelihoods, human health and habitats globally (see also Sections 2.4.4.2 and 2.5.5.2)."

Cardiovascular fitness for example is a root cause of morbidity and mortality form heat stress (Schuster  et al., 2017). The World Health Organization has developed a framework of climate-resilient health systems that addresses both mitigation and adaptation goals (WHO, 2015). Universal health coverage (UHC) is an essential component of climate-resilient health systems. In most countries, access to health services is better in urban than in rural areas. However, there remain large urban populations with insufficient coverage of health services (WHO and WB, 2015) and UHC tracking needs to take better account of inequalities in coverage, including differences in access within cities and further disaggregation of urban populations by income. Thus, health sector investment is an important tool in adaptive action and capacity. Analyses of health survey data shows that, globally, access to health care is increasing toward UHC targets (Lozano  et al., 2020). Financing for global health has increased steadily in the last two decades and modelling shows this trend is likely  to continue to 2050, but at a slower pace of growth and the current disparities in per-capita health spending persist between high and low/middle income countries, leading to insufficient health service coverage for the poorest populations (Chang  et al., 2019a). Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial in LMIC and will remain the only means to access health care for many poor urban populations."

Improved building design and spatial urban planning (where facilities are located) are essential to increase resilience for higher temperature and flood risk (medium evidence; high agreement ) (WHO, 2021; Codjoe et al., 2020; Korah and Cobbinah, 2017). Public health systems rely on information systems (including disease and vector surveillance and monitoring) to identify new and emergent public health risks.

Access to knowledge is an important determinant of well-being, inclusivity and livelihood mobility and of driving human behaviour. Knowledge systems include formal educational provision (capital assets, syllabus and human capital), informal learning based in social interaction and customary institutions (including through social media) and public communication (news media, government and other information systems including commercial messaging). There is a growing body of literature addressing the role of information and communication technology in shaping behaviour in disaster response and recovery and climate action, with particular focus on social media use and serious gaming (Houston  et al., 2015; Carson  et al., 2018) (see Section 6.3.4.3)"

Universities and think tanks, as well as the third and private sector are key support mechanisms, particularly at the local level and when working in collaboration with local government and communities. They can support the development of critical educational resources and innovative communication methods, as well as facilitate the design and implementation of climate policies and related action plans."
wg2_ch06_6.3.3.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Youth, adult communities, social media and the commercial media can have a significant impact on advancing climate awareness and the legitimacy of adaptive action, particularly in large urban areas (medium evidence, high agreement ). Climate change education in urban settlements has increasingly focused on enhancing children and young people’s political agency in schools, universities, and in formal and informal media settings (Cutter-Mackenzie and Rousell, 2019). However, an ambiguous framing of climate impacts and adaptation, for example around the science of urban heat islands by the media, can also exacerbate local community confusion and uncertainty (Iping  et al., 2019) and further training and capacity building opportunities such as for vocational qualifications is still required across diverse settings (Simmons, 2021). Communication strategies deployed in formal education and social media can be highly influential in exchanging information and establishing narratives and viewpoints that frame what adaptive action is legitimate, especially in large cities (Simpson, Napawan and Snyder, 2019). However, the effectiveness of communication strategies for change, for example from Mayoral offices, can also be influenced by wider political and structural drivers including community literacy or political partisanship (Boussalis, Coan and Holman, 2019). Recent research (e.g., Macintyre  et al., 2018) highlights the need for new learning approaches to climate education from school age to adult education. Emphasis is on inclusivity in learning and recognising diverse perspectives across multiple levels and settings, from formal and informal education to wider social learning. Informal learning that takes place outside of school settings, such as in libraries and botanical gardens, in everyday life is increasingly recognised as a key arena for climate education, life-long learning and nurturing environmental citizenship and activism (Paraskeva-Hadjichambi  et al., 2020)."

However, urban cultural policies are still limited, for example, Cape Town is the only African city to have developed a city-level cultural policy (Sitas, 2020). Cultural heritage refers to both tangible (e.g., historic buildings and sites) and intangible (e.g., oral traditions and social practices) resources inherited from the past (Fatorić and Egberts, 2020; Jackson, Dugmore and Riede, 2018). Learning about past societal and environment changes through heritage offers opportunity for reflection and transfer of knowledge and skills. This takes place in multiple contexts such as museums and cultural landscapes, and in everyday life (Fatorić and Egberts, 2020; Jackson, Dugmore and Riede, 2018). Cultural heritage is primarily associated with identity and is closely intertwined with the complexities of history, politics, economics and memory. Climate change adds another layer of complexity to cultural heritage and resource management (Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017b). Changing climatic conditions are already negatively impacting World Heritage Sites such as the Cordilleras’ Rice Terraces of the Philippines and earthen architecture sites, for example the Djenné mosque in Mali, are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and water interactions (UNESCO, 2021). Climate change impacts intangible cultural heritage across diverse settings such as in the Caribbean and Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) where traditional ways of life and related aspects such as oral traditions and performing arts are under threat from extreme weather events (UNESCO, 2021)."

To date, however, evidence indicates that adaptation actions prioritise archaeological sites (Carmichael  et al., 2017; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2018; Pollard  et al., 2014; Dawson, 2013). The efficacy of adaptation of historic buildings can be increased through increased and stable funding, incentives, stakeholder engagement, and legal and political frameworks (Dutra  et al., 2017; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2018; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017b; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017a; Leijonhufvud, 2016; Phillips, 2015; Sesana  et al., 2019; Sesana  et al., 2018; Sitas, 2020)."

This is particularly important given that the significance of cultural heritage is often intangible, and its value cannot be determined solely through quantitative indicators. Accessing local resources (craftsmanship and materials compatible with the originals) can also improve built cultural heritage’s adaptation capacity (Phillips, 2015)."

As noted in Section 6.2.6, human behaviour can be a driving force for adaptation impacts on BCH at risk. Despite challenges associated with intangibility, socio-cultural heritage such as Indigenous knowledge (e.g., food security and water management practices) presents important opportunities for climate adaptation and resilience building. More research is needed across diverse contexts to understand feasible climate adaptation measures, and barriers and opportunities for building the resilience of both built and intangible cultural heritage, as well as to increase awareness of cultural heritage benefits among climate change policymakers (Fatorić and Egberts, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4_p1,6.3.4.1 Temperature Regulation ,"Well-functioning ecosystems can play a significant role in buffering cities, settlements and infrastructure from climate hazards at multiple scales (robust evidence, high agreement ). Nature-based solutions (NBS) are actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits (Cohen-Shacham  et al., 2016). Widely recognised as low-regret measures for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, green and blue infrastructure investments and natural area conservation in cities can provide NBS across scales to reduce temperature shocks and provide natural flood defences among other adaptation and resilience benefits (McPhearson  et al., 2018; Andersson  et al., 2019; Frantzeskaki  et al., 2019). Blue infrastructure, for example, provides ecological and hydrological functions (e.g., evaporation, transpiration, drainage, infiltration, detention) critical to sustainable urban water management (Iojă et al., 2021). Public parks, urban forests, street trees and green roofs, as well as lakes, ponds and streams are widely documented for providing local cooling, grass and riparian buffers, forested watersheds can enhance flood and drought protection for cities and settlements, and mangrove stands and wetlands in coastal areas can reduce storm surges. Despite increasing knowledge about NBS (here encompassing literature on ecosystem services for climate change adaptation and resilience, ecosystem-based adaptation, and benefits of green and blue infrastructure for adaptation), recent studies indicate that nature-based approaches to adaptation and resilience are still under-recognised and under-invested in urban planning and development (Matthews, Lo and Byrne, 2015; Geneletti and Zardo, 2016; Frantzeskaki  et al., 2019), despite the potential scale of benefits, for example, a recent study covering 70 cities in Latin America calculated that 96 million people would benefit from improving main watersheds with green infrastructure (Tellman  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4_p2,6.3.4.1 Temperature Regulation ,"Grey infrastructure often damages or eliminates biophysical processes (e.g., through soil sealing, stream burial or altered hydrology) necessary to sustain ecosystems, habitats and livelihoods, where urban ecological infrastructure (Childers  et al., 2019) can be more flexible and cost effective for providing flood risk reduction and other benefits (Palmer  et al., 2015). Hybrid approaches are emerging that integrate ecological and grey (engineered) infrastructure in adaptation planning and hazard protection (Grimm  et al., 2016; Depietri and McPhearson, 2017). Explicit policy uptake by city authorities is increasing (Hansen  et al., 2015; Hölscher  et al., 2019), such as in New York where in 2010 the city committed to a hybrid infrastructure plan for storm water management, investing USD 5.3 billion over 20 years, of which USD 2.4 billion was targeted for green infrastructure investments (NYC, 2010). A subset of services from urban ecosystems are being increasingly invested in as NBS for climate adaptation pathways (Keeler  et al., 2019; Kabisch  et al., 2016) and included as regulatory drivers through flood management, hazard mitigation and air pollution regulations that encourage or enforce the implementation of green infrastructure practices (Davis  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4_p3,6.3.4.1 Temperature Regulation ,"Development and climate mitigation co-benefits of NBS is an additional reason that NBS are being increasingly taken up by cities, including for improving health and livelihoods, particularly for poor, marginalised groups (Poulsen  et al., 2015; Poulsen, Neff and Winch, 2017; Maughan, Laycock Pedersen and Pitt, 2018; Simon-Rojo, 2019; Cederlöf, 2016). Co-benefits include a wide range of social and environmental benefits (Brink  et al., 2016; Alves  et al., 2019) for human physical and mental health (Kabisch, van den Bosch and Lafortezza, 2017; Sarkar, Webster and Gallacher, 2018; Engemann  et al., 2019; Rojas-Rueda  et al., 2019), climate mitigation (De la Sota  et al., 2019) and as habitat for local biodiversity (Ziter, 2016; Knapp, Schmauck and Zehnsdorf, 2019). At the same time, concerns about the unintended consequences of investing in green infrastructure for NBS, such as how it may contribute to gentrification (Turkelboom  et al., 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2018; Haase  et al., 2017), create more public use, increase water demand (Nouri, Borujeni and Hoekstra, 2019) or contribute to criminal activity (Cilliers and Cilliers, 2015) underlines the challenges of investing in adaptation in complex urban systems (see Section 6.2.6). Additionally, more place-based analyses of the efficacy of NBS for reducing climate impacts across varying urban contexts and future climate scenarios are needed to better understand the cost effectiveness of investing in NBS to provide disaster risk reduction and deliver critical co-benefits for human well-being. Cooperation between scientists, decision-makers and Indigenous knowledge-holders can supplement current efforts and ensure that investments in NBS do not negatively impact indigenous communities (Ban  et al., 2018; Seddon  et al., 2021; Townsend, Moola and Craig, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Nature-based strategies, including street trees, green roofs, green walls and other urban vegetation, can reduce heat and extreme heat by cooling private and public spaces (robust evidence, high agreement ). Shading and evapotranspiration are the primary mechanisms for vegetation-induced urban cooling (Coutts  et al., 2016). Shading reduces mean radiant temperature, which is the dominant influence on outdoor human thermal comfort under warm, sunny conditions (Thorsson  et al., 2014; Viguié et al., 2020). Outdoor green space and parks may also slightly reduce indoor heat hazard (Viguié et al., 2020). Apart from lowering temperature, NBS may also contribute to lower energy costs by reducing extra demand for conventional sources of cooling (e.g., air conditioning) (Viguié et al., 2020; Foustalieraki  et al., 2017), especially during peak demand periods. Homes with shade trees that are located in cities where air conditioning systems are common can save over 30% of residential peak cooling demand (Zardo  et al., 2017; Wang  et al., 2015). Green roofs have been shown to significantly lower surface temperatures on buildings (Bevilacqua  et al., 2017) and modelling suggests that green roofs, if employed widely throughout urban areas, have the potential to impact the regional heat profile of cities (Bevilacqua  et al., 2017; Rosenzweig, Gaffin and Parshall, 2006). Community or allotment gardens, backyard greening and other types of low vegetation, as well as lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, can also provide local cooling benefits to nearby residents (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017; Larondelle  et al., 2014; Santamouris, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Urban climate models show that increased vegetation cover results in reducing both mean air temperatures and extreme temperatures during heatwaves (Heaviside, Cai and Vardoulakis, 2015; Ferreira and Duarte, 2019; Schubert and Grossman-Clarke, 2013). Greater density and more canopy coverage relative to other built and paved surfaces increases shade provision and evapotranspiration (Hamstead  et al., 2016; Grilo  et al., 2020; Herath, Halwatura and Jayasinghe, 2018; Knight  et al., 2021). However, local cooling by vegetation depends on regional climate context, geographic setting of the city, urban form, the density and placement of the trees, in addition to a variety of other ecological, technical, and social factors, such as local stewardship (Salmond  et al., 2016). Green spaces less than 0.5–2.0 ha may have negligible cooling effects at regional scales, but impacts of shading can have microscale cooling benefits (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017; Zardo  et al., 2017). Vegetation impacts on day versus night-time cooling varies (Imran  et al., 2019) as does cooling potential in temperate versus tropical climates. The supply of cooler air from surrounding peri-urban and rural areas can impact cooling in the urban core suggesting that regional adaptation planning for NBS is important to maintain or extend ventilation paths from the urban fringe into the city centre (Schau-Noppel, Kossmann and Buchholz, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"To maximize the adaptation benefits of NBS for regulating urban heat, it can be helpful to prioritise tree planting and other urban greening investments in areas where heat vulnerability and risk are the highest, especially communities that lack urban tree canopy or accessibility to parks to cool off during hot days or heatwaves (Ziter  et al., 2019). Planting trees closely together or in partly permeable vegetated barriers along streets can improve local cooling benefits. Additionally, choosing tree species with leaves that have the greatest leaf area index or the largest leaves can improve cooling performance, as those trees have the greatest shading and evapotranspiration benefits that, in turn, provide the greatest cooling effects (Keeler  et al., 2019). Drought-resistant trees, often native trees, are ideal to avoid high watering costs, though dry or water scarce areas may limit adoption of urban vegetation as an NBS strategy (Coutts  et al., 2013). Native trees and permaculture can provide additional benefits for local biodiversity as shown in study in Melbourne, Australia which found that increasing vegetation from 10% to 30% increased occupancy of bats, birds, bees, beetles and bugs by up to 130% (Threlfall  et al., 2017), with particularly high impact on native species.. Additionally, planting fruit or nut trees can provide co-benefits for local food production, and yet choice of species and placement is important to consider with respect to local cultural needs and norms (Adegun, 2018; Adegun, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"NBS in cities can help regulate air quality by absorbing air pollutants (medium evidence, medium agreement ). For example, planting trees  or vegetated barriers along streets or in urban forests can reduce particulate matter, the ambient air pollutant with the largest global health burden (Janhäll, 2015; Tiwary, Reff and Colls, 2008; Matos  et al., 2019; McDonald  et al., 2016). However, findings show that trees can also positively affect ground-level ozone (Calfapietra  et al., 2013; Kroeger  et al., 2014), airborne pollen concentrations (Willis and Petrokofsky, 2017) and indirectly affect air quality through reduced emissions from energy production offset by shade provision (Keeler  et al., 2019). Certain tree species however can also be detrimental to urban ozone formation by emitting significant amounts of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Decreasing urban emissions of VOCs is an increasingly important ozone mitigation strategy in urban areas (Fitzky  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Trees can also have negative effects by increasing pedestrian exposure to pollution if they are introduced in heavily travelled street canyons where air pollutants can be trapped (Vos  et al., 2013; Gromke and Blocken, 2015). To maximise the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving air quality, planners and managers can target tree selection for species with low VOC emissions, low allergen emissions and high pollutant deposition potential (Keeler  et al., 2019), and combine with low pollution transportation policies. Studies suggest sensitive planting of roadside tree canopies can have positive effects on air pollutants (Beckett, Freer Smith and Taylor, 2000; Yang, Chang and Yan, 2015). For example, Xue et al. (2021) found that the PM2.5 reduction between 2013 and 2017 in China was associated with a saving of approximately USD 111 billion yr -1 nationally. Tree planting near schools, nursing homes and hospitals can ensure that benefits provided by trees are delivered to the local populations that stand to benefit the most from improved air quality, but species need to be adapted to regional climate to provide benefits over time (Donovan, 2017; Nowak  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urban parks and open spaces, forests, wetlands, green roofs and engineered stormwater treatment devices help manage stormwater and wastewater by reducing the volume of stormwater runoff, reducing surface flooding, and reducing contamination of runoff by pollutants (robust evidence, high agreement ). Engineered devices include bioswales, rain gardens, and detention and retention ponds, and are becoming common and standard approaches to mitigate the negative effects of impervious surfaces on stormwater quality and surface flooding in cities (Zhou, 2014; McPhillips  et al., 2020). Allotment gardens, street trees, green roofs and urban forests may also help reduce runoff and provide a stormwater retention service (Pennino, McDonald and Jaffe, 2016; Berland  et al., 2017; Gittleman  et al., 2017). Modelling and empirical studies show that NBS at small spatial scales lead to improvements in water quality and reduction of peak flows (Moore  et al., 2016; Keeler  et al., 2019; Webber  et al., 2020). Peak flow reductions are greatest for small rain events. For example, D-Ville et al. (2018) observed a 30–70% reduction in peak flow for the 1-in-30 year storm, but performance reduces for more intense rainfall or if saturated (Garofalo  et al., 2016). Employing NBS to reduce flooding on roads can be an important adaptation mechanism for reducing the impact of flooding events on traffic flows (Pregnolato  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"During periods with intense precipitation, low-lying urban parks and open space, engineered devices and wetlands can play an important role in reducing stormwater runoff volumes by providing places for water to be stored and infiltrate during heavy storms (Moore  et al., 2016). However, the magnitude of the runoff reduction service will depend on the total area of green infrastructure, vegetation type and its position on the landscape. There is less evidence of the effectiveness of NBS at larger temporal and spatial scales (Pregnolato  et al., 2017; Jefferson  et al., 2017). The performance of NBS depends on the degree to which their extent and spatial configuration in the city are optimised to capture runoff (Fry and Maxwell, 2017). Investing in a diversity of NBS types may be important to maximise stormwater management and flood regulation, as different types of engineered NBS have different strengths and weaknesses."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Overall, NBS are attractive adaptation options for stormwater management and to reduce impacts of pluvial and fluvial flooding in cities (Rosenzweig  et al., 2018a) compared, and in combination, with grey infrastructure. Cities with combined sewer infrastructure are likely  to see benefits from NBS due to reductions in stormwater quantity and reduced sewage overflows. Cities where a large proportion of residents lack access to piped infrastructure and drink surface water may see large benefits, especially to human health, from NBS investments (Keeler  et al., 2019). Where future large-scale upgrades or installation of grey infrastructure will be necessary, new and growing cities may have more opportunity to realise large net benefits from investments in NBS. Older cities, and new, rapidly urbanising areas that lack large-scale water infrastructure may see the greatest benefits from enhanced NBS, relative to cities where heavy investments infrastructure upgrades have already been made. Cities facing climate changes that include more frequent or extreme precipitation may also see large water quality benefits from investment in NBS (Keeler  et al., 2019). Overall, there is increasing evidence that NBS for addressing stormwater is cost effective (Bixler  et al., 2020; Kozak  et al., 2020; Mguni, Herslund and Jensen, 2016), especially in cities facing a need to update current infrastructures."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Coastal ecosystems including coral and oyster reefs, coastal forests including mangroves and other tree species, salt marshes and other types of wetland habitat, seagrass, dunes and barrier islands can reduce impacts of coastal flooding and storms (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Zhao, Roberts and Ludy, 2014; Boutwell and Westra, 2016; Narayan  et al., 2017; Yang, Kerger and Nepf, 2015; Bridges  et al., 2015; World Bank, 2016) (see also Section CCP2 Cities and Settlements by the Sea). Recent literature highlights the value of nature-based approaches for coastal protection in terms of avoided damages and human well-being (Narayan  et al., 2017; Silva  et al., 2016a). NBS can protect coasts from flooding through reducing the wave energy by drag friction, reducing wave overtopping by eliminating vertical barriers, and absorbing floodwaters in soil (Arkema, Scyphers and Shepard, 2017; Dasgupta  et al., 2019; Zhu  et al., 2020). For example, coastal and marine vegetation and reefs can dissipate wave energy, attenuate wave heights and nearshore currents, decrease the extent of wave run-up on beaches, and trap sediments (Ferrario  et al., 2014; Bridges  et al., 2015). These effects result in lower water levels and reduce shoreline erosion, which in turn has potential to save lives and prevent expensive property damages (Narayan  et al., 2017)."

The expectation is that coastal ecosystems can help stabilise shorelines, protect communities against storm surge and from tidal-influenced flooding, while providing other co-benefits for people and ecosystems. However, vegetation along protected coastlines with higher frequency, lower intensity coastal hazards (National Research Council, 2014) may be more effective for stabilising shorelines and reducing risk to coastal communities and properties, and benefits will depend on local hydrology of the coastal region. Narayan et al. (2017) estimate that coastal wetlands alone reduced direct flood damages by USD 625 million during Hurricane Sandy in the USA in 2012. Similarly, researchers found that villages with wider mangroves between them and the coast experienced significantly fewer deaths than villages with narrow or no mangroves during a 1999 cyclone in India (World Bank, 2016). Recently, Arkema et al. (2017) noted that the number of people, poor families, elderly and total value of residential property most exposed to hazards along the entire coast of the USA can be reduced by half if existing coastal habitats remain fully intact."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Coastal habitats also have limitations in their ability to protect coasts from extreme events. Some studies suggest reduced effectiveness of vegetation and reefs for coastal protection from large storm waves and surge (Möller  et al., 2014; Guannel  et al., 2016) and there is active debate in the literature about the ability of ecosystems to mitigate the impact of tsunamis (Gillis  et al., 2017). Further research is needed to understand and quantify coastal protection services provided by these hybrid green-grey solutions, especially in urban areas (Bilkovic  et al., 2017). Additionally, in some coastlines, water may be too deep or waves too high for some species such as mangroves to grow, thrive and provided needed NBS."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Maximising the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving coastal flood protection research requires that cities seek to restore and conserve the vegetation and reef types that are appropriate for the exposure setting and in sufficient abundance to be effective. In particular, planners and managers can use vegetation in protected bays as alternatives to hard infrastructure for shoreline stabilisation. However, the influence of ecosystems on flooding and erosion is variable and depends on a suite of social, ecological and infrastructural factors that vary within and among urban areas (Narayan  et al., 2017; Ruckelshaus  et al., 2016; Bridges  et al., 2015). Additionally, long-term planning to restore or ensure resilience of individual species and ecosystems that may themselves be damaged or destroyed during extreme events is needed in order for urban green and blue infrastructure to continue providing NBS over the longer term."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"NBS reduce both the volume of floodwater and the impact of floods (medium evidence, medium agreement ). NBS reduce the volume of runoff by increasing infiltration and water storage (Shuster  et al., 2005; Salvadore, Bronders and Batelaan, 2015), and affect the production and impact of flood waters through reducing river energy and flow speed through physical blockage, stabilising riverbanks during flood events, creating space for floodwaters to expand and combating land subsidence (Palmer, Filoso and Fanelli, 2014; Ahilan  et al., 2018). Installing NBS to increase infiltration on low slopes and high-permeability soils can reduce the impacts of potential increases in urban flooding driven by climate change, especially for small- to medium-scale flood events (lower than 20% mean annual flood) (Moftakhari  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Source reduction strategies include creating permeable areas such as parks and open spaces, as well as engineered devices such as raingardens, bioswales and retention ponds that help retain stormwater runoff from impervious areas. River restoration can reduce flood peak flow and provide space for floodwaters to expand. Planting and maintaining vegetation along riverbanks, often in the form of parks or river restoration, maintains structural integrity during flood events. Wetland construction and improved connectivity to floodplains also reduces flood peaks. Efforts to restore floodplains are important to create space for floodwaters and reduce exposure by moving people out of the hazard zone. Floodplain restoration also provides access to the river that has multiple benefits including recreation, access to water for domestic use and other cultural ecosystem services. A key adaptation strategy is to reduce streambank erosion (a result of high peak flow) using riparian vegetation to stabilise riverbanks during flood events."

Built flood-control infrastructure, such as levees and stream channelisation, reduces the demand for nature-based flood impact reduction. Cities facing flood risk that do not currently have extensive grey flood-mitigation infrastructure may find NBS to be an appealing, lower cost solution (Keeler  et al., 2019). In cities where flood-control grey infrastructure already exists, there is less demand for NBS of flood protection, but NBS may provide important back up, especially in a changing climate that may increase flood hazards (City of Los Angeles, 2017; Elmqvist  et al., 2019). Overall, city and basin-wide NBS for riverine flood impact reduction can reduce the generation of new hazards by making space for water which can reduce the potential for a false sense of security provided by traditional flood management approaches (Ruangpan  et al., 2020; Turkelboom  et al., 2021)."

NBS that protect or restore the natural infiltration capacity of a watershed can increase the water supply service to various extents, improving drought protection and providing resilient water supply (Drosou  et al., 2019; Krauze and Wagner, 2019), although different forms of NBS (e.g., street trees, parks and open space, community gardens, and engineered devices such as rain gardens, bioswales or retention ponds) contribute in different ways to increasing stormwater infiltration. Additional sources of water may be available to replace the water supplied by NBS, such as rainwater harvesting, inter-basin transfers or desalination plants. Reliance on naturally sourced, locally available surface water and groundwater is more energy efficient and economical than desalination or water reuse for potable use (Boelee  et al., 2017), while rainwater harvesting is even more economical. Increasing the amount of green space in urban areas can secure and regulate water supplies, improving water security (Liu and Jensen, 2018; Bichai and Cabrera Flamini, 2018). However, Bhaskar et al. (2016) reviewed the effect of urbanisation and NBS on baseflow and suggest that the confounded effects of infiltration and evapotranspiration losses, combined with the subsurface infrastructure (sewer systems) and geology, makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of baseflow enhancement resulting from the implementation of NBS in cities."

This is particularly true in some lower-income countries where rapid urbanisation is occurring, which compounds existing food insecurity (Satterthwaite, McGranahan and Tacoli, 2010; Vermeiren  et al., 2013). Land availability and suitability for gardens can be further constrained by land use history, including past industrial uses that can contaminate soils with pollutants such as lead."

Not all cities can benefit similarly from vertical agriculture since higher heating costs to produce vegetables indoors during northern winters consumes considerable amounts of energy and may generate fossil fuel emissions depending on the energy source (Goldstein  et al., 2016a; Mohareb  et al., 2017). Some regions can benefit from more traditional outdoor urban farming, such as in South and Southeast Asia, which can support multiple growing cycles per year for some crops, particularly in tropical areas where irrigation is available. Light availability, soil health and water availability will impact food production in urban areas. For example, a study conducted in Vancouver, Canada, demonstrated that light attenuation from buildings and trees can reduce both crop yield and water demand for crop growth (Johnson  et al., 2015)."

While urban agriculture may provide benefits in terms of stability of food access in low-income households in some regions of the Global South where the climate is warmer, the shorter growing seasons in colder climates will reduce the role of outdoor urban agriculture in year-round food supply and diets. Though urban agriculture constitutes a small fraction of total food consumption in some urban areas, several studies have attempted to estimate the extent to which urban agriculture could theoretically meet urban total food or vegetable demand (Badami and Ramankutty, 2015; McClintock, 2014; Hara  et al., 2018).

The supply of cooler air from surrounding peri-urban and rural areas can impact cooling in the urban core suggesting that regional adaptation planning for NBS is important to maintain or extend ventilation paths from the urban fringe into the city centre (Schau-Noppel, Kossmann and Buchholz, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"To maximize the adaptation benefits of NBS for regulating urban heat, it can be helpful to prioritise tree planting and other urban greening investments in areas where heat vulnerability and risk are the highest, especially communities that lack urban tree canopy or accessibility to parks to cool off during hot days or heatwaves (Ziter  et al., 2019). Planting trees closely together or in partly permeable vegetated barriers along streets can improve local cooling benefits. Additionally, choosing tree species with leaves that have the greatest leaf area index or the largest leaves can improve cooling performance, as those trees have the greatest shading and evapotranspiration benefits that, in turn, provide the greatest cooling effects (Keeler  et al., 2019). Drought-resistant trees, often native trees, are ideal to avoid high watering costs, though dry or water scarce areas may limit adoption of urban vegetation as an NBS strategy (Coutts  et al., 2013). Native trees and permaculture can provide additional benefits for local biodiversity as shown in study in Melbourne, Australia which found that increasing vegetation from 10% to 30% increased occupancy of bats, birds, bees, beetles and bugs by up to 130% (Threlfall  et al., 2017), with particularly high impact on native species.. Additionally, planting fruit or nut trees can provide co-benefits for local food production, and yet choice of species and placement is important to consider with respect to local cultural needs and norms (Adegun, 2018; Adegun, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"NBS in cities can help regulate air quality by absorbing air pollutants (medium evidence, medium agreement ). For example, planting trees  or vegetated barriers along streets or in urban forests can reduce particulate matter, the ambient air pollutant with the largest global health burden (Janhäll, 2015; Tiwary, Reff and Colls, 2008; Matos  et al., 2019; McDonald  et al., 2016). However, findings show that trees can also positively affect ground-level ozone (Calfapietra  et al., 2013; Kroeger  et al., 2014), airborne pollen concentrations (Willis and Petrokofsky, 2017) and indirectly affect air quality through reduced emissions from energy production offset by shade provision (Keeler  et al., 2019). Certain tree species however can also be detrimental to urban ozone formation by emitting significant amounts of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Decreasing urban emissions of VOCs is an increasingly important ozone mitigation strategy in urban areas (Fitzky  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Trees can also have negative effects by increasing pedestrian exposure to pollution if they are introduced in heavily travelled street canyons where air pollutants can be trapped (Vos  et al., 2013; Gromke and Blocken, 2015). To maximise the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving air quality, planners and managers can target tree selection for species with low VOC emissions, low allergen emissions and high pollutant deposition potential (Keeler  et al., 2019), and combine with low pollution transportation policies. Studies suggest sensitive planting of roadside tree canopies can have positive effects on air pollutants (Beckett, Freer Smith and Taylor, 2000; Yang, Chang and Yan, 2015). For example, Xue et al. (2021) found that the PM2.5 reduction between 2013 and 2017 in China was associated with a saving of approximately USD 111 billion yr -1 nationally. Tree planting near schools, nursing homes and hospitals can ensure that benefits provided by trees are delivered to the local populations that stand to benefit the most from improved air quality, but species need to be adapted to regional climate to provide benefits over time (Donovan, 2017; Nowak  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urban parks and open spaces, forests, wetlands, green roofs and engineered stormwater treatment devices help manage stormwater and wastewater by reducing the volume of stormwater runoff, reducing surface flooding, and reducing contamination of runoff by pollutants (robust evidence, high agreement ). Engineered devices include bioswales, rain gardens, and detention and retention ponds, and are becoming common and standard approaches to mitigate the negative effects of impervious surfaces on stormwater quality and surface flooding in cities (Zhou, 2014; McPhillips  et al., 2020). Allotment gardens, street trees, green roofs and urban forests may also help reduce runoff and provide a stormwater retention service (Pennino, McDonald and Jaffe, 2016; Berland  et al., 2017; Gittleman  et al., 2017). Modelling and empirical studies show that NBS at small spatial scales lead to improvements in water quality and reduction of peak flows (Moore  et al., 2016; Keeler  et al., 2019; Webber  et al., 2020). Peak flow reductions are greatest for small rain events. For example, D-Ville et al. (2018) observed a 30–70% reduction in peak flow for the 1-in-30 year storm, but performance reduces for more intense rainfall or if saturated (Garofalo  et al., 2016). Employing NBS to reduce flooding on roads can be an important adaptation mechanism for reducing the impact of flooding events on traffic flows (Pregnolato  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"During periods with intense precipitation, low-lying urban parks and open space, engineered devices and wetlands can play an important role in reducing stormwater runoff volumes by providing places for water to be stored and infiltrate during heavy storms (Moore  et al., 2016). However, the magnitude of the runoff reduction service will depend on the total area of green infrastructure, vegetation type and its position on the landscape. There is less evidence of the effectiveness of NBS at larger temporal and spatial scales (Pregnolato  et al., 2017; Jefferson  et al., 2017). The performance of NBS depends on the degree to which their extent and spatial configuration in the city are optimised to capture runoff (Fry and Maxwell, 2017). Investing in a diversity of NBS types may be important to maximise stormwater management and flood regulation, as different types of engineered NBS have different strengths and weaknesses."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Overall, NBS are attractive adaptation options for stormwater management and to reduce impacts of pluvial and fluvial flooding in cities (Rosenzweig  et al., 2018a) compared, and in combination, with grey infrastructure. Cities with combined sewer infrastructure are likely  to see benefits from NBS due to reductions in stormwater quantity and reduced sewage overflows. Cities where a large proportion of residents lack access to piped infrastructure and drink surface water may see large benefits, especially to human health, from NBS investments (Keeler  et al., 2019). Where future large-scale upgrades or installation of grey infrastructure will be necessary, new and growing cities may have more opportunity to realise large net benefits from investments in NBS. Older cities, and new, rapidly urbanising areas that lack large-scale water infrastructure may see the greatest benefits from enhanced NBS, relative to cities where heavy investments infrastructure upgrades have already been made. Cities facing climate changes that include more frequent or extreme precipitation may also see large water quality benefits from investment in NBS (Keeler  et al., 2019). Overall, there is increasing evidence that NBS for addressing stormwater is cost effective (Bixler  et al., 2020; Kozak  et al., 2020; Mguni, Herslund and Jensen, 2016), especially in cities facing a need to update current infrastructures."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Coastal ecosystems including coral and oyster reefs, coastal forests including mangroves and other tree species, salt marshes and other types of wetland habitat, seagrass, dunes and barrier islands can reduce impacts of coastal flooding and storms (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Zhao, Roberts and Ludy, 2014; Boutwell and Westra, 2016; Narayan  et al., 2017; Yang, Kerger and Nepf, 2015; Bridges  et al., 2015; World Bank, 2016) (see also Section CCP2 Cities and Settlements by the Sea). Recent literature highlights the value of nature-based approaches for coastal protection in terms of avoided damages and human well-being (Narayan  et al., 2017; Silva  et al., 2016a). NBS can protect coasts from flooding through reducing the wave energy by drag friction, reducing wave overtopping by eliminating vertical barriers, and absorbing floodwaters in soil (Arkema, Scyphers and Shepard, 2017; Dasgupta  et al., 2019; Zhu  et al., 2020). For example, coastal and marine vegetation and reefs can dissipate wave energy, attenuate wave heights and nearshore currents, decrease the extent of wave run-up on beaches, and trap sediments (Ferrario  et al., 2014; Bridges  et al., 2015). These effects result in lower water levels and reduce shoreline erosion, which in turn has potential to save lives and prevent expensive property damages (Narayan  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Researchers, practitioners and policy-makers are increasingly calling for the use of nature-based approaches to protect urban shorelines from coastal hazards (Cunniff and Schwartz, 2015; Bilkovic  et al., 2017). The expectation is that coastal ecosystems can help stabilise shorelines, protect communities against storm surge and from tidal-influenced flooding, while providing other co-benefits for people and ecosystems. However, vegetation along protected coastlines with higher frequency, lower intensity coastal hazards (National Research Council, 2014) may be more effective for stabilising shorelines and reducing risk to coastal communities and properties, and benefits will depend on local hydrology of the coastal region. Narayan et al. (2017) estimate that coastal wetlands alone reduced direct flood damages by USD 625 million during Hurricane Sandy in the USA in 2012. Similarly, researchers found that villages with wider mangroves between them and the coast experienced significantly fewer deaths than villages with narrow or no mangroves during a 1999 cyclone in India (World Bank, 2016). Recently, Arkema et al. (2017) noted that the number of people, poor families, elderly and total value of residential property most exposed to hazards along the entire coast of the USA can be reduced by half if existing coastal habitats remain fully intact."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Coastal habitats also have limitations in their ability to protect coasts from extreme events. Some studies suggest reduced effectiveness of vegetation and reefs for coastal protection from large storm waves and surge (Möller  et al., 2014; Guannel  et al., 2016) and there is active debate in the literature about the ability of ecosystems to mitigate the impact of tsunamis (Gillis  et al., 2017). Further research is needed to understand and quantify coastal protection services provided by these hybrid green-grey solutions, especially in urban areas (Bilkovic  et al., 2017). Additionally, in some coastlines, water may be too deep or waves too high for some species such as mangroves to grow, thrive and provided needed NBS."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Maximising the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving coastal flood protection research requires that cities seek to restore and conserve the vegetation and reef types that are appropriate for the exposure setting and in sufficient abundance to be effective. In particular, planners and managers can use vegetation in protected bays as alternatives to hard infrastructure for shoreline stabilisation. However, the influence of ecosystems on flooding and erosion is variable and depends on a suite of social, ecological and infrastructural factors that vary within and among urban areas (Narayan  et al., 2017; Ruckelshaus  et al., 2016; Bridges  et al., 2015). Additionally, long-term planning to restore or ensure resilience of individual species and ecosystems that may themselves be damaged or destroyed during extreme events is needed in order for urban green and blue infrastructure to continue providing NBS over the longer term."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"NBS reduce both the volume of floodwater and the impact of floods (medium evidence, medium agreement ). NBS reduce the volume of runoff by increasing infiltration and water storage (Shuster  et al., 2005; Salvadore, Bronders and Batelaan, 2015), and affect the production and impact of flood waters through reducing river energy and flow speed through physical blockage, stabilising riverbanks during flood events, creating space for floodwaters to expand and combating land subsidence (Palmer, Filoso and Fanelli, 2014; Ahilan  et al., 2018). Installing NBS to increase infiltration on low slopes and high-permeability soils can reduce the impacts of potential increases in urban flooding driven by climate change, especially for small- to medium-scale flood events (lower than 20% mean annual flood) (Moftakhari  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Source reduction strategies include creating permeable areas such as parks and open spaces, as well as engineered devices such as raingardens, bioswales and retention ponds that help retain stormwater runoff from impervious areas. River restoration can reduce flood peak flow and provide space for floodwaters to expand. Planting and maintaining vegetation along riverbanks, often in the form of parks or river restoration, maintains structural integrity during flood events. Wetland construction and improved connectivity to floodplains also reduces flood peaks. Efforts to restore floodplains are important to create space for floodwaters and reduce exposure by moving people out of the hazard zone. Floodplain restoration also provides access to the river that has multiple benefits including recreation, access to water for domestic use and other cultural ecosystem services. A key adaptation strategy is to reduce streambank erosion (a result of high peak flow) using riparian vegetation to stabilise riverbanks during flood events."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Cities manage flood risk using different types of adaptation and regulatory mechanisms (Naturally Resilient Communities, 2017). Built flood-control infrastructure, such as levees and stream channelisation, reduces the demand for nature-based flood impact reduction. Cities facing flood risk that do not currently have extensive grey flood-mitigation infrastructure may find NBS to be an appealing, lower cost solution (Keeler  et al., 2019). In cities where flood-control grey infrastructure already exists, there is less demand for NBS of flood protection, but NBS may provide important back up, especially in a changing climate that may increase flood hazards (City of Los Angeles, 2017; Elmqvist  et al., 2019). Overall, city and basin-wide NBS for riverine flood impact reduction can reduce the generation of new hazards by making space for water which can reduce the potential for a false sense of security provided by traditional flood management approaches (Ruangpan  et al., 2020; Turkelboom  et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"The role of NBS has been increasingly recognised for improving urban water management, emphasising it’s contribution for climate-adapted development and sustainable urbanisation (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Wong and Brown, 2009). NBS that protect or restore the natural infiltration capacity of a watershed can increase the water supply service to various extents, improving drought protection and providing resilient water supply (Drosou  et al., 2019; Krauze and Wagner, 2019), although different forms of NBS (e.g., street trees, parks and open space, community gardens, and engineered devices such as rain gardens, bioswales or retention ponds) contribute in different ways to increasing stormwater infiltration. Additional sources of water may be available to replace the water supplied by NBS, such as rainwater harvesting, inter-basin transfers or desalination plants. Reliance on naturally sourced, locally available surface water and groundwater is more energy efficient and economical than desalination or water reuse for potable use (Boelee  et al., 2017), while rainwater harvesting is even more economical. Increasing the amount of green space in urban areas can secure and regulate water supplies, improving water security (Liu and Jensen, 2018; Bichai and Cabrera Flamini, 2018). However, Bhaskar et al. (2016) reviewed the effect of urbanisation and NBS on baseflow and suggest that the confounded effects of infiltration and evapotranspiration losses, combined with the subsurface infrastructure (sewer systems) and geology, makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of baseflow enhancement resulting from the implementation of NBS in cities."
wg2_ch06_6.3.4.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"To maximise the adaptation benefits of NBS for urban water supply research suggests that managers and planners consider NBS as alternatives to traditional stormwater management techniques, where possible, since these solutions can promote groundwater recharge. As green infrastructure is increasingly being used for stormwater absorption in cities (McPhillips  et al., 2020), rain gardens, wetlands, or engineered infiltration ponds and bioswales are the NBS most likely to promote recharge, reduce evapotranspiration and contribute to water provisioning."

However, potential for expanding open air urban food production may be practically constrained by land availability (Badami and Ramankutty, 2015; Martellozzo  et al., 2014). This is particularly true in some lower-income countries where rapid urbanisation is occurring, which compounds existing food insecurity (Satterthwaite, McGranahan and Tacoli, 2010; Vermeiren  et al., 2013). Land availability and suitability for gardens can be further constrained by land use history, including past industrial uses that can contaminate soils with pollutants such as lead."

Not all cities can benefit similarly from vertical agriculture since higher heating costs to produce vegetables indoors during northern winters consumes considerable amounts of energy and may generate fossil fuel emissions depending on the energy source (Goldstein  et al., 2016a; Mohareb  et al., 2017). Some regions can benefit from more traditional outdoor urban farming, such as in South and Southeast Asia, which can support multiple growing cycles per year for some crops, particularly in tropical areas where irrigation is available. Light availability, soil health and water availability will impact food production in urban areas. For example, a study conducted in Vancouver, Canada, demonstrated that light attenuation from buildings and trees can reduce both crop yield and water demand for crop growth (Johnson  et al., 2015)."

While urban agriculture may provide benefits in terms of stability of food access in low-income households in some regions of the Global South where the climate is warmer, the shorter growing seasons in colder climates will reduce the role of outdoor urban agriculture in year-round food supply and diets. Though urban agriculture constitutes a small fraction of total food consumption in some urban areas, several studies have attempted to estimate the extent to which urban agriculture could theoretically meet urban total food or vegetable demand (Badami and Ramankutty, 2015; McClintock, 2014; Hara  et al., 2018). Maximising the adaptation and resilience benefits of NBS for food production and security suggests the need to embrace the multi-functionality of urban agriculture, rather than viewing it as solely concerning food production (Barthel, Parker and Ernstson, 2015)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5_p1,6.3.5.1 Urban Morphology and Built Form ,"Globally, it is estimated that as much as USD 94 trillion of investment is required between 2016 and 2040 to replace, upgrade and extend the world’s physical infrastructure (Oxford Economics, 2017), much of which is ageing and will require replacement. Given the typical lifespan of infrastructure, this is both an opportunity and an imperative to ensure this investment is low carbon and resilient to climate change risks (Grafakos  et al., 2020). ‘Grey’ or physical infrastructure is a priority for adaptation because its performance is sensitive to climate (particularly extreme events) and decisions on design and renovation have long-lasting implications and are hard to reverse (Ürge-Vorsatz  et al., 2018). Avoiding longer-term impacts on society, the economy and the environment will require future investment and retrofitting of existing infrastructure, to be undertaken in the context of the risks of climate change (Dawson  et al., 2018; Rosenzweig  et al., 2018b). However, evidence from Africa shows that the benefits of pro-active adaptation measures and policies for infrastructure can result in net savings depending on the country context (Section 9.8.5)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5_p2,6.3.5.1 Urban Morphology and Built Form ,"Engineered measures for hazard mitigation such as seawalls, slope revetments and river levees, as well as air conditioning are increasingly implemented in urban centres, but many engineering interventions are less affordable and accessible in LMICs because of high construction and maintenance costs. These adaptive measures can also counter mitigation objectives because of reliance on climate-polluting energy sources. Despite this, engineering measures such as seawalls for tsunami protection and cooling areas in cities provide critical hazard reduction functions in urban contexts (Depietri and McPhearson, 2017). As Pelling et al. (2018) highlight, sustainable risk reduction can be better achieved where these engineering measures include the at-risk poor majority and inclusive planning to support pro-poor risk reduction. Inclusive design and management of physical infrastructure can enhance contributions to climate resilient development (Table 6.6 and Supplementary Material). This section covers urban morphology and built form, building design, information and communication technology, energy, transport, water and sanitation, and coastal management. All these domains of physical infrastructure will require adaptation to cope with a changing climate; many of them can also contribute to broader adaptation for cities and settlements."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urban morphology describes the overall status of cities as physical, environmental and cultural entities. Cities interact with surrounding environmental processes, for example, as documented in Section 6.2 by influencing urban temperature, but also precipitation and through coastal and riverine development fluvial and coastal sedimentary regimes of erosion and deposition that impact on flood risk. Rapid, increased urbanisation has contributed to observed flood risks in recent decades (see Section 5 4.2.4; Tramblay  et al., 2019). The design process for physical infrastructure projects and significant construction (e.g., residential or industrial estates and large industrial development) typically includes risk assessments and social and environmental impact assessments that consider neighbouring land uses and connected infrastructure. Land use planning can consider diverse land uses and their interactions at the neighbourhood level (Section 6.3.2.1). Resilience planning aims to bring together integrated, systemic views and enable joined-up planning at the city level (as well as lower scales) (Section 6.3.2.1). There is however a lack of long-term studies that assess the climate change impacts on urban form, including informal settlements (Bai  et al., 2018; Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019), leading to impact assessments that often overlook urban form (Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019). Additionally, context-specific spatial tools and community based approaches lack a precise connection to urban morphology. For example, there is a need for further studies that connect solar radiation, urban morphology (e.g., aspect and plot ratio), and the urban heat island spatio-temporal variability (Giridharan and Emmanuel, 2018; Li  et al., 2019c)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several tools and models have emerged in response to recommendations from AR5, including models that assess the impacts of urban heat island (Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019), climatic uncertainty (Dhar and Khirfan, 2017), flood vulnerability (Abebe, Kabir and Tesfamariam, 2018) and inundation (Barau  et al., 2015; Ford  et al., 2019). For example, findings from Kano, Nigeria, reveal that a lack of distribution of certain urban morphological features, including open spaces and streets (both pervious and impervious), roof and building materials (e.g., concrete and metallic) and urban ecological features (e.g., urban ponds and ecological basin), exacerbates inundations and their associated impacts (Barau  et al., 2015). Also, findings about the urban forms of coastal settlements, particularly in small islands, reveal that they often experience severe beach erosion due to wave action, sea level rise and storm surge that leads to landward retreat of coastline which threatens their social and economic activities (Dhar and Khirfan, 2016; Lane  et al., 2015; Khirfan and El-Shayeb, 2019). Despite these examples, very limited research is available to offer assessments of different urban scale morphologies and urban scale adaptation planning, including planning adaptation across supply chains and networked relationships with distant urban and rural places connected through trade and resource (financial, human and material) or waste flows."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Interventions in the morphology and built form of cities can contribute to the reduction of the urban heat island effect and reduce the consequences of urban heatwaves. These can include installing air conditioning, establishing public cooling centres (i.e., for use during heatwaves), pavement watering (Parison  et al., 2020a) and increasing surface albedo through ‘cool roofs’ (i.e., with high-reflectance materials) and walls. Air conditioning can significantly increase the local urban heat island (Salamanca  et al., 2014; Wang  et al., 2019a) and the choice of refrigerant has a significant impact on global warming potential (McLinden  et al., 2017). The relative efficiency of cool roofs compared with green roofs is variable, because while white roofs have similar potential to reduce the urban heat island (Li, Bou-Zeid and Oppenheimer, 2014), they can quickly turn grey due to dust and air pollution, losing their effectiveness (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017), although these effects are now well studied and newer performance standards should account for ageing and soiling effects on reflectivity (Paolini  et al., 2014). Ageing of ‘cool pavements’ is more complex, which makes their long-term performance less reliable to predict (Lontorfos, Efthymiou and Santamouris, 2018). The cooling performance of green roofs is highly variable and depends on the actual water content of the green roof substrate, with dry vegetation performing poorly in terms of cooling (Parison  et al., 2020b). This holds true for regular vegetation and NBS in general (Daniel, Lemonsu and Viguie, 2018). For all built environment adaptations, changes are locked-in for a long time, and are likely to be expensive so that care is needed to avoid potential negative impacts on social equity (Cabrera and Najarian, 2015; Romero-Lankao  et al., 2018; Fried  et al., 2020; Rode  et al., 2017) and carbon-intensive construction (Bai  et al., 2018; Seto  et al., 2016)."

They include buildings that are adaptive to ensure user comfort during extremes of hot and cold as well as to floods (e.g., building on stilts and amphibian architecture). Changes to design standards can scale quickly and widely, but retrofit of existing buildings is expensive, so care must be taken to avoid potential negative impacts on social equity (Schünemann  et al., 2020; Matopoulos, Kovács and Hayes, 2014; Ajibade and McBean, 2014; Bastidas-Arteaga and Stewart, 2019). Buildings can be adapted to the negative consequences of climate change by altering their characteristics, for example increasing the insulation values (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Fisk, 2015; Fosas  et al., 2018; Barbosa, Vicente and Santos, 2015; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Taylor  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018), adding solar shading (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Barbosa, Vicente and Santos, 2015; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Taylor  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Osman and Sevinc, 2019), increasing natural ventilation, preferably during the night (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Osman and Sevinc, 2019; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Cellura  et al., 2017; Fosas  et al., 2018; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019), solar orientation of bedroom windows (Schuster  et al., 2017), applying high-albedo materials for the building envelope (van Hooff  et al., 2014; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Baniassadi  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018), altering the thermal mass (van Hooff  et al., 2014; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Din and Brotas, 2017), adding green roofs/facades to poorly insulated buildings (Geneletti and Zardo, 2016; Skelhorn, Lindley and Levermore, 2014; van Hooff  et al., 2014; de Munck  et al., 2018; Feitosa and Wilkinson, 2018) and for water harvesting (Sepehri  et al., 2018)."

However, it must be noted that the cooling potential of natural ventilation will decrease in the future because of increasing outdoor air temperatures (Gilani and O’Brien, 2020). Increased insulation (including through green solutions) without shading and ventilation can also lead to adverse impacts through the lowering of nighttime cooling (Reder  et al., 2018). Similarly, air conditioning performance also decreases with increasing outdoor temperatures, in addition to being maladaptive where use increases anthropogenic heat emissions into the urban area, and global greenhouse gas emissions if powered by carbon intensive energy systems (Wang  et al., 2018c)."

Façade fixes such as overhangs, louvres and insulated walls are effective at shading buildings from solar radiation, while complex ones such as texture walls, diode roofs and roof ponds are effective at minimising heat gains from solar radiation and ambient heat (Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard, 2018). Passive cooling is inspired also by traditional design forms, for example from Mediterranean, Islamic and Mughal architecture in the Indian sub-continent (Di Turi and Ruggiero, 2017; Izadpanahi, Farahani and Nikpey, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"In addition, wind towers, solar chimneys and air vents are features that facilitate cool air circulation within buildings while dissipating heat (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019). These features may be arranged to address hotspots or highly frequented spaces within buildings. Similar to NBS, the effectiveness of passive cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island varies widely depending on the location of the sun, wind direction and the type of strategy used. For instance, natural ventilation strategies (e.g., wind towers, solar chimneys, etc.) have shown temperature reductions of up to 14°C (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019; Calautit and Hughes, 2016; Rabani  et al., 2014). Shading strategies alone can reduce indoor temperatures by 3°C, while heat sinks (in which heat is directed at a medium such as water) may result in indoor temperatures up to 6°C lower than the outdoor temperature (Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard, 2018). More systemic interventions, such as altering urban form through urban planning, can mitigate the urban heat island across suburbs and cities (Lee and Levermore, 2019; Takkanon and Chantarangul, 2019; Yin  et al., 2018; Liang and Keener, 2015; Emmanuel and Steemers, 2018). Experience in Kano (Nigeria) has shown that incorporating Indigenous knowledge into building design and urban planning can increase resilience to heat and flood risks (Barau  et al., 2015). A review by Lemi (2019) suggests that traditional ecological knowledge can provide wider climate change adaptation benefits."

This can be a result of pressures from clients for cheaper structures, developers illegally cutting costs or regulators lacking capacity for enforcement. Technological innovation can also be slow to embed itself in building norms and standards. Innovation also lies outside the formal sector and can include artisanal building techniques that may have adaptive value. Examples from Latin America demonstrate how initiatives in informal settlement improvement associated with housing policy, guaranteeing access to land and decent housing, show the opportunity for overarching policies encompassing development, poverty reduction, disaster-risk reduction, climate-change adaptation and climate-change mitigation (see Section 12.5.5)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are deeply intertwined with the functioning of urban and infrastructure systems, and are at the core of the ‘smart city’ concept (Angelidou, 2015). ICT is more flexible than other physical infrastructure, although as other sectors are increasingly reliant on ICT, it is creating new climate-related failure mechanisms (Norman, 2018; Maki  et al., 2019). ICT assets and networks in urban, national and international communications systems will need to be strengthened to enable ICT infrastructure to better cope with climate change, and to enable ICT infrastructure to support the resilience of cities, settlements and other infrastructure. The increased pervasiveness of ICT in smart cities, smart infrastructure and day-to-day living, will evidently have long-term implications for exposure to climate change risks and how cities manage those risks (Norman, 2018; Maki  et al., 2019). For example, even if the ICT network is resilient to heatwaves, it is dependent on the electricity network to power it. Conversely, other networks are dependent upon ICT for control systems, for example smart grids for energy. There is limited information on how these interdependencies, and associated risks, will evolve."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Although networked like many other infrastructure systems, ICT components have some distinctive properties. They are relatively cheap, and the advent of wireless communications has enabled ICT to have the widest reach of all infrastructures. Components can be rapidly deployed or repaired, and generally ICT networks are therefore built with inherent redundancy and flexibility (Sakano  et al., 2016). Components have a wide range of expected lifetimes which leads to faster cycles of innovation. There is therefore greater potential to accelerate uptake of climate resilience in this infrastructure sector, but conversely, this can increase waste and (energy intensive) resource consumption. For example, mobile phones and computers may last as little as a year, cables and switching units may be moved and upgraded to improve bandwidth every few years, poles and masts are typically designed to last several decades, whilst exchanges and other critical nodes can be in use for over half a century."

Big data is being used to inform responses to humanitarian emergencies (Pham  et al., 2014; Ali  et al., 2016), as well as to generate new forms of citizen engagement and reporting (e.g., community-based maps of flood-prone areas) that can help to inform coping and adaptive responses (Ogie  et al., 2019)."

Typically, ICT is inadequate on its own to make a significant difference (Toya and Skidmore, 2015). The role of ICTs in adaptive pathways is influenced by the availability of locally relevant information (e.g., weather-based advisory messages, local market prices), the accessibility of information by all members of the community (e.g., using various text, audio and visual content, local languages, addressing gender-related exclusion, cost and digital competencies) and the applicability of information at the appropriate scale (local, regional or national), including data quality and verification (Namukombo, 2016; Haworth  et al., 2018)."

Many assets can be strengthened, relocated or replaced with new equipment built to higher standards. An example of this is in the UK where a total of £172 million is being invested between 2011 and 2023 to raise flood protection of substations to be resilient to the 1-in-1000 year flood (ENA, 2015). Electricity cables can be upgraded in anticipation of reduced efficiency in a warmer climate, although in many locations this may be achieved autonomously to meet growth in electricity demand (Fu  et al., 2017)."

Shreshta et al. (2021) show that changing reservoir operation rules can offset reduced water availability under RCP8.5 until 2050, but is insufficient by the 2080s. van Vliet et al., (2016) showed that a 10% increase in hydroelectric generation efficiency can compensate for reduced water availability in most regions. Higher efficiency thermoelectric plans offset impacts under lower climate change scenarios but are shown to be inadequate under RCP8.5 by the 2080s; whereas a switch to seawater and dry (air) cooling provides a net increase under this scenario. However, these technologies can increase costs. Increasing the temperature of water discharged from the power station can have negative environmental impacts (Thome  et al., 2016; Yang  et al., 2015)."

Smart grids are being increasingly deployed within municipalities to provide more efficient management of supply and demand and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, however, there is limited understanding of their performance and reliability during floods and other extreme weather events (Vasenev, Montoya and Ceccarelli, 2016; Feldpausch-Parker  et al., 2018)."

For example, solar-charged street lamps and household lighting gives reliable nighttime lighting, providing safety, security and resilience to disruption of network power supplies (Burgess  et al., 2017). At larger scales, deploying solar power on building roofs reduces energy demand for cooling by 12% and lowers the urban heat island, and thereby has health benefits (Masson  et al., 2014a).

Adaptation of road and rail networks in Australasia includes re-routing, coastal protection, improved drainage and upgrading of rails (Table 11.7.) In areas with substantial infrastructure deficits, such as much of Africa, investments in public transport and transit-oriented development are highlighted as desired mitigation-adaptation interventions within cities of South Africa, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso (Section 9.8.5.3).

Mobility transitions have the potential to improve mobility and accessibility, to influence urban form and to reduce vehicular use (and thereby infrastructure degradation), vehicle miles travelled and vehicle-based emissions (Sperling, Pike and Chase, 2018). For example, use of electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles and greater uptake of public transport and other vehicles that reduce exhaust head emissions reduces the urban heat island (Kolbe, 2019). Carsharing can reduce carbon emissions by over 50% (Shaheen, Martin and Hoffman-Stapleton, 2019). Ride hailing, matching non-professional drivers of private vehicles with paying passengers, positively impacts low-income, low-car ownership households in Los Angeles (Brown, 2018), and fills market gaps in cities where public transit infrastructure is inadequate, unreliable or unsafe (Suatmadi, Creutzig and Otto, 2019; Vanderschuren and Baufeldt, 2018), but can also create a precarious and insecure job market that impacts well-being (Fleming, 2017).

A combination of these measures is usually required (e.g., Ives, Simpson and Hall, 2018; Dirwai  et al., 2021; Wang  et al., 2018a).

Adaptation in African cities is often dominated by informal responses (Owusu-Daaku and Diko, 2018). In the absence of centralised responses, low-income residents in Nairobi (Kenya) dig trenches and construct temporary dikes to protect homes, and in Accra (Ghana) the community has developed a range of social responses, including communal drains and local evacuation teams, to help protect people and critical valuables, although these innovations require connection to city-wide infrastructure to effectively reduce widespread risk (Amoako, 2018)."

Water-sensitive urban design, low-impact development, sponge cities, sustainable urban drainage and natural flood management involve deployment of systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes that result in the infiltration, evapotranspiration or use of stormwater to protect water quality and associated aquatic habitat. These are being designed and implemented at increasingly ambitious scales. For example, China’s Sponge City initiative sets a goal of 80% of urban land able to absorb or reuse 70% of stormwater through underground storage tanks and tunnels, and use of pervious pavements, in addition to NBS (Chan  et al., 2018; Muggah, 2019).

wg2_ch06_6.3.5.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"Physical infrastructure can provide substantial benefits, be constructed quickly and has enabled coastal cities and settlements around the world to flourish and grow. Multifunctional physical infrastructure can also provide economic and social co-benefits. These include integration of transport, recreation, agriculture (e.g., cattle pasture), founding for wind turbines, housing, office or industry into the coastal management infrastructure (Anvarifar  et al., 2017; Kothuis and Kok, 2017). However, physical infrastructures can also disrupt natural processes, often leading to undesirable impacts such as pollution, degradation of ecosystems and displacement of erosion and flood risk to other locations (Wang  et al., 2018b; Dawson, 2015; Nicholls, Dawson and Day, 2015). Coastal management strategies that take a hybrid approach, integrating physical and natural infrastructure, provide the best opportunities for managing risk and achieving wider socioeconomic and environmental benefits (Depietri and McPhearson, 2017; Morris  et al., 2018; Schoonees  et al., 2019; Powell  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urban morphology describes the overall status of cities as physical, environmental and cultural entities. Cities interact with surrounding environmental processes, for example, as documented in Section 6.2 by influencing urban temperature, but also precipitation and through coastal and riverine development fluvial and coastal sedimentary regimes of erosion and deposition that impact on flood risk. Rapid, increased urbanisation has contributed to observed flood risks in recent decades (see Section 5 4.2.4; Tramblay  et al., 2019). The design process for physical infrastructure projects and significant construction (e.g., residential or industrial estates and large industrial development) typically includes risk assessments and social and environmental impact assessments that consider neighbouring land uses and connected infrastructure. Land use planning can consider diverse land uses and their interactions at the neighbourhood level (Section 6.3.2.1). Resilience planning aims to bring together integrated, systemic views and enable joined-up planning at the city level (as well as lower scales) (Section 6.3.2.1). There is however a lack of long-term studies that assess the climate change impacts on urban form, including informal settlements (Bai  et al., 2018; Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019), leading to impact assessments that often overlook urban form (Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019). Additionally, context-specific spatial tools and community based approaches lack a precise connection to urban morphology. For example, there is a need for further studies that connect solar radiation, urban morphology (e.g., aspect and plot ratio), and the urban heat island spatio-temporal variability (Giridharan and Emmanuel, 2018; Li  et al., 2019c)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several tools and models have emerged in response to recommendations from AR5, including models that assess the impacts of urban heat island (Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019), climatic uncertainty (Dhar and Khirfan, 2017), flood vulnerability (Abebe, Kabir and Tesfamariam, 2018) and inundation (Barau  et al., 2015; Ford  et al., 2019). For example, findings from Kano, Nigeria, reveal that a lack of distribution of certain urban morphological features, including open spaces and streets (both pervious and impervious), roof and building materials (e.g., concrete and metallic) and urban ecological features (e.g., urban ponds and ecological basin), exacerbates inundations and their associated impacts (Barau  et al., 2015). Also, findings about the urban forms of coastal settlements, particularly in small islands, reveal that they often experience severe beach erosion due to wave action, sea level rise and storm surge that leads to landward retreat of coastline which threatens their social and economic activities (Dhar and Khirfan, 2016; Lane  et al., 2015; Khirfan and El-Shayeb, 2019). Despite these examples, very limited research is available to offer assessments of different urban scale morphologies and urban scale adaptation planning, including planning adaptation across supply chains and networked relationships with distant urban and rural places connected through trade and resource (financial, human and material) or waste flows."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Interventions in the morphology and built form of cities can contribute to the reduction of the urban heat island effect and reduce the consequences of urban heatwaves. These can include installing air conditioning, establishing public cooling centres (i.e., for use during heatwaves), pavement watering (Parison  et al., 2020a) and increasing surface albedo through ‘cool roofs’ (i.e., with high-reflectance materials) and walls. Air conditioning can significantly increase the local urban heat island (Salamanca  et al., 2014; Wang  et al., 2019a) and the choice of refrigerant has a significant impact on global warming potential (McLinden  et al., 2017). The relative efficiency of cool roofs compared with green roofs is variable, because while white roofs have similar potential to reduce the urban heat island (Li, Bou-Zeid and Oppenheimer, 2014), they can quickly turn grey due to dust and air pollution, losing their effectiveness (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017), although these effects are now well studied and newer performance standards should account for ageing and soiling effects on reflectivity (Paolini  et al., 2014). Ageing of ‘cool pavements’ is more complex, which makes their long-term performance less reliable to predict (Lontorfos, Efthymiou and Santamouris, 2018). The cooling performance of green roofs is highly variable and depends on the actual water content of the green roof substrate, with dry vegetation performing poorly in terms of cooling (Parison  et al., 2020b). This holds true for regular vegetation and NBS in general (Daniel, Lemonsu and Viguie, 2018). For all built environment adaptations, changes are locked-in for a long time, and are likely to be expensive so that care is needed to avoid potential negative impacts on social equity (Cabrera and Najarian, 2015; Romero-Lankao  et al., 2018; Fried  et al., 2020; Rode  et al., 2017) and carbon-intensive construction (Bai  et al., 2018; Seto  et al., 2016)."

They include buildings that are adaptive to ensure user comfort during extremes of hot and cold as well as to floods (e.g., building on stilts and amphibian architecture). Changes to design standards can scale quickly and widely, but retrofit of existing buildings is expensive, so care must be taken to avoid potential negative impacts on social equity (Schünemann  et al., 2020; Matopoulos, Kovács and Hayes, 2014; Ajibade and McBean, 2014; Bastidas-Arteaga and Stewart, 2019). Buildings can be adapted to the negative consequences of climate change by altering their characteristics, for example increasing the insulation values (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Fisk, 2015; Fosas  et al., 2018; Barbosa, Vicente and Santos, 2015; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Taylor  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018), adding solar shading (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Barbosa, Vicente and Santos, 2015; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Taylor  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Osman and Sevinc, 2019), increasing natural ventilation, preferably during the night (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Pérez-Andreu  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Osman and Sevinc, 2019; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Cellura  et al., 2017; Fosas  et al., 2018; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019), solar orientation of bedroom windows (Schuster  et al., 2017), applying high-albedo materials for the building envelope (van Hooff  et al., 2014; Invidiata and Ghisi, 2016; Baniassadi  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018), altering the thermal mass (van Hooff  et al., 2014; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Din and Brotas, 2017), adding green roofs/facades to poorly insulated buildings (Geneletti and Zardo, 2016; Skelhorn, Lindley and Levermore, 2014; van Hooff  et al., 2014; de Munck  et al., 2018; Feitosa and Wilkinson, 2018) and for water harvesting (Sepehri  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"In general, the most promising adaptation measures are a combination of solar shading with increased levels of insulation and ample possibilities to apply natural ventilation to cool down a building (e.g., van Hooff  et al., 2014; Makantasi and Mavrogianni, 2016; Fosas  et al., 2018; Barbosa, Vicente and Santos, 2015; Taylor  et al., 2018; Triana, Lamberts and Sassi, 2018; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016). However, it must be noted that the cooling potential of natural ventilation will decrease in the future because of increasing outdoor air temperatures (Gilani and O’Brien, 2020). Increased insulation (including through green solutions) without shading and ventilation can also lead to adverse impacts through the lowering of nighttime cooling (Reder  et al., 2018). Similarly, air conditioning performance also decreases with increasing outdoor temperatures, in addition to being maladaptive where use increases anthropogenic heat emissions into the urban area, and global greenhouse gas emissions if powered by carbon intensive energy systems (Wang  et al., 2018c)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Passive cooling is a design-based, widely used strategy to create naturally ventilated buildings, making it an important alternative to address the urban heat island for residential and commercial buildings (Al-Obaidi, Ismail and Rahman, 2014). Generally, passive cooling is achieved by controlling the interactions between the building envelope and the natural elements. Façade fixes such as overhangs, louvres and insulated walls are effective at shading buildings from solar radiation, while complex ones such as texture walls, diode roofs and roof ponds are effective at minimising heat gains from solar radiation and ambient heat (Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard, 2018). Passive cooling is inspired also by traditional design forms, for example from Mediterranean, Islamic and Mughal architecture in the Indian sub-continent (Di Turi and Ruggiero, 2017; Izadpanahi, Farahani and Nikpey, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"In addition, wind towers, solar chimneys and air vents are features that facilitate cool air circulation within buildings while dissipating heat (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019). These features may be arranged to address hotspots or highly frequented spaces within buildings. Similar to NBS, the effectiveness of passive cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island varies widely depending on the location of the sun, wind direction and the type of strategy used. For instance, natural ventilation strategies (e.g., wind towers, solar chimneys, etc.) have shown temperature reductions of up to 14°C (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019; Calautit and Hughes, 2016; Rabani  et al., 2014). Shading strategies alone can reduce indoor temperatures by 3°C, while heat sinks (in which heat is directed at a medium such as water) may result in indoor temperatures up to 6°C lower than the outdoor temperature (Oropeza-Perez and Østergaard, 2018). More systemic interventions, such as altering urban form through urban planning, can mitigate the urban heat island across suburbs and cities (Lee and Levermore, 2019; Takkanon and Chantarangul, 2019; Yin  et al., 2018; Liang and Keener, 2015; Emmanuel and Steemers, 2018). Experience in Kano (Nigeria) has shown that incorporating Indigenous knowledge into building design and urban planning can increase resilience to heat and flood risks (Barau  et al., 2015). A review by Lemi (2019) suggests that traditional ecological knowledge can provide wider climate change adaptation benefits."

This can be a result of pressures from clients for cheaper structures, developers illegally cutting costs or regulators lacking capacity for enforcement. Technological innovation can also be slow to embed itself in building norms and standards. Innovation also lies outside the formal sector and can include artisanal building techniques that may have adaptive value. Examples from Latin America demonstrate how initiatives in informal settlement improvement associated with housing policy, guaranteeing access to land and decent housing, show the opportunity for overarching policies encompassing development, poverty reduction, disaster-risk reduction, climate-change adaptation and climate-change mitigation (see Section 12.5.5)."

ICT is more flexible than other physical infrastructure, although as other sectors are increasingly reliant on ICT, it is creating new climate-related failure mechanisms (Norman, 2018; Maki  et al., 2019). ICT assets and networks in urban, national and international communications systems will need to be strengthened to enable ICT infrastructure to better cope with climate change, and to enable ICT infrastructure to support the resilience of cities, settlements and other infrastructure. The increased pervasiveness of ICT in smart cities, smart infrastructure and day-to-day living, will evidently have long-term implications for exposure to climate change risks and how cities manage those risks (Norman, 2018; Maki  et al., 2019). For example, even if the ICT network is resilient to heatwaves, it is dependent on the electricity network to power it. Conversely, other networks are dependent upon ICT for control systems, for example smart grids for energy. There is limited information on how these interdependencies, and associated risks, will evolve."

They are relatively cheap, and the advent of wireless communications has enabled ICT to have the widest reach of all infrastructures. Components can be rapidly deployed or repaired, and generally ICT networks are therefore built with inherent redundancy and flexibility (Sakano  et al., 2016). Components have a wide range of expected lifetimes which leads to faster cycles of innovation. There is therefore greater potential to accelerate uptake of climate resilience in this infrastructure sector, but conversely, this can increase waste and (energy intensive) resource consumption. For example, mobile phones and computers may last as little as a year, cables and switching units may be moved and upgraded to improve bandwidth every few years, poles and masts are typically designed to last several decades, whilst exchanges and other critical nodes can be in use for over half a century."

Big data is being used to inform responses to humanitarian emergencies (Pham  et al., 2014; Ali  et al., 2016), as well as to generate new forms of citizen engagement and reporting (e.g., community-based maps of flood-prone areas) that can help to inform coping and adaptive responses (Ogie  et al., 2019)."

Typically, ICT is inadequate on its own to make a significant difference (Toya and Skidmore, 2015). The role of ICTs in adaptive pathways is influenced by the availability of locally relevant information (e.g., weather-based advisory messages, local market prices), the accessibility of information by all members of the community (e.g., using various text, audio and visual content, local languages, addressing gender-related exclusion, cost and digital competencies) and the applicability of information at the appropriate scale (local, regional or national), including data quality and verification (Namukombo, 2016; Haworth  et al., 2018)."

Many assets can be strengthened, relocated or replaced with new equipment built to higher standards. An example of this is in the UK where a total of £172 million is being invested between 2011 and 2023 to raise flood protection of substations to be resilient to the 1-in-1000 year flood (ENA, 2015).

Shreshta et al.

Higher efficiency thermoelectric plans offset impacts under lower climate change scenarios but are shown to be inadequate under RCP8.5 by the 2080s; whereas a switch to seawater and dry (air) cooling provides a net increase under this scenario.

At larger scales, deploying solar power on building roofs reduces energy demand for cooling by 12% and lowers the urban heat island, and thereby has health benefits (Masson  et al., 2014a).

For example, use of electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles and greater uptake of public transport and other vehicles that reduce exhaust head emissions reduces the urban heat island (Kolbe, 2019).

wg2_ch06_6.3.5.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"A number of adaptation actions are available to reduce the impacts of floods on water and sanitation infrastructure. Active management reduces blockages in water infrastructure and protects related services such as roads and culverts which are essential to ensure the operation of onsite sanitation infrastructure (Capone  et al., 2020). The impact of floods for onsite or sewerage systems can be lowered by reducing or eliminating excreta from the environment through regular maintenance, cleaning and clearing of blockages (O’Donnell and Thorne, 2020; Borges Pedro  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"Infrastructure to protect key assets such as water and wastewater treatment plants or pumping stations has a high cost but benefits all connected households and reduces pollution from flood events. In well-regulated water sectors, there has been an increasing focus on such investments (Campos and Darch, 2015). Whereas more diffused cheaper interventions can reduce flood water ingress to domestic toilets (Irwin  et al., 2018). Luh et al. (2017) found that protected dug wells were one of the least resilient technologies, whereas piped, treated, utility managed surface water systems had higher resilience."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"Protecting water sources from pollution is even more important in a warmer climate that increases the frequency of algal blooms. Individual assets such as water intake pipes can be protected using screens (Kim  et al., 2020a), whereas basin-scale land management is required to reduce nutrient load from runoff (Me  et al., 2018), whilst injecting water or installing barriers can protect coastal aquifers from salinisation (Siegel, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"More radical structural interventions may be needed in the longer term, but would need to be planned and delivered in coordination with investments in other sectors, particularly housing (Lüthi, Willetts and Hoffmann, 2020). As an interim measure, sanitation services with a lower reliance on fixed infrastructure, or container-based sanitation could be appropriate in many urban areas that are badly affected by flooding (Mills  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.6_p7,NO_TITLE,"Other actions include use of adaptive planning (Evans, Rowell and Semazzi, 2020), integration of measures of climate resilience into water safety plans (Prats  et al., 2017), as well as improved accounting and management of water resources (Lasage  et al., 2015). Policy prescriptions on technologies for service delivery and changes in management models offer potential to reduce risks, particularly in low-income settings (Howard  et al., 2016). Where formal sewerage provision is lacking, community based adaptation that incorporates both the function of the sanitation system and the vulnerability of users (e.g., women, children, elderly, ill or disabled) into the design is essential (Duncker, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Cities are deploying a broad range of strategies to adapt infrastructure to flooding, with hard engineering approaches (e.g., dikes and seawalls) increasingly complementing soft approaches, including planning and use of nature-based solutions, that emphasise natural and social capital (Jongman, 2018; Sovacool, 2011). The infrastructure can alter downstream risks and lead to increased residual risk by encouraging more floodplain construction (Miller, Gabe and Sklarz, 2019; Ludy and Kondolf, 2012). Physical infrastructure is highly cost effective for large settlements, but not always for small settlements (Tiggeloven  et al., 2020) and can be inaccessible to poorer communities (Sayers, Penning-Rowsell and Horritt, 2018; Van Bavel, Curtis and Soens, 2018).

wg2_ch06_6.3.5.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"As urban areas have expanded, so too have the number of vulnerable assets, and efforts may now emphasise reducing construction in high-risk regions (Paprotny  et al., 2018a). The National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, for example, calls for reductions in inappropriate developments in floodplains (Kuklicke and Demeritt, 2016; UK Environment Agency, 2020). Because climate change increases the flood risk profile of certain regions, reconsideration of design criteria has become more common (Ayyub, 2018). New York City now requires the sewer system currently designed for hydraulic capacity in 5-year design life should be designed for 50-year design life, taking into account climate changes over that period (NYC, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation strategies are diverse and often involve hybrid physical and NBS, and increasingly integrated management plans that consider both flood prevention and designing infrastructure and supporting people to cope with floods when they occur. Adaptation typically focuses on (i) increasing the standard of protection to compensate for the increased magnitude of extreme events; (ii) increased maintenance to cope with increased frequency of extremes and changes in ambient conditions; (iii) changed maintenance regimes from narrower maintenance windows, for example as assets are used more frequently (Sayers, Walsh and Dawson, 2015); (iv) land use planning and management to reduce exposure and manage hydrological flows; and (v) raising awareness, preparedness and incident management. In high population areas, hard interventions such as dikes and levees are generally cost effective (Jongman, 2018; Ward  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"Prevention or attenuation solutions include: rooftop detention, reservoirs, bioretention, permeable paving, infiltration techniques, open drainage, floating structures, wet-proofing, raised structures, coastal defences, barriers and levees, and have been deployed in diverse configurations and environments around the world (Matos Silva and Costa, 2016). Barcelona (Spain) reached 90% impermeable surface cover by the 1980s, and has recently begun implementing artificial detention, underground reservoirs and permeable pavement technologies (Favaro and Chelleri, 2018; Matos Silva and Costa, 2016). Florida Power and Light (USA), which provides service to approximately 10 million people, is investing USD 3 billion in flood protection and the hardening of assets (for example, upgrading wooden poles to steel and concrete) (Brody, Rogers and Siccardo, 2019). The City of Seattle recommends increasing preventative maintenance activities, the regular review of appropriate pavement technologies and modifications to subgrades and drainage facilities for high-risk areas (City of Seattle, 2017), whilst also providing benefits to transport disruption (Arrighi  et al., 2019). Adaptation in African cities is often dominated by informal responses (Owusu-Daaku and Diko, 2018). In the absence of centralised responses, low-income residents in Nairobi (Kenya) dig trenches and construct temporary dikes to protect homes, and in Accra (Ghana) the community has developed a range of social responses, including communal drains and local evacuation teams, to help protect people and critical valuables, although these innovations require connection to city-wide infrastructure to effectively reduce widespread risk (Amoako, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.7_p5,NO_TITLE,"More recent developments include sensor arrays to catalogue a river’s reach and how changing hydraulics interact with roadways (Forbes  et al., 2019). Kuala Lumpur’s (Malaysia) stormwater management and road tunnel (SMART) during extreme rain events transitions the motorway to a stormwater conduit, an example of multifunctionality enabling agility (Isah, 2016; Markolf  et al., 2019). Smart stormwater control systems are starting to use real-time control to dynamically manage the retention and movement of water during storms, though uptake at large scales which provide the greatest improvements in performance have been limited (Xu  et al., 2020b)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.7_p6,NO_TITLE,"In contrast to a ‘fail-safe’ approach to design which emphasises strengthening infrastructure against more intense environmental conditions, ‘safe-to-fail’ flood strategies allow infrastructure to fail in its ability to carry out its primary function but control the consequences of the failure. Examples include the use of a bioretention basin in Scottsdale (Arizona, USA) to accommodate excess runoff and help drain the city; a subsidy for affected farmers for lost crop production as part of the Netherlands’ Room for the River programme; targeted destruction of a levee to control flooding in the Mississippi River Valley in 2011 (Kim  et al., 2019). Water-sensitive urban design, low-impact development, sponge cities, sustainable urban drainage and natural flood management involve deployment of systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes that result in the infiltration, evapotranspiration or use of stormwater to protect water quality and associated aquatic habitat. These are being designed and implemented at increasingly ambitious scales. For example, China’s Sponge City initiative sets a goal of 80% of urban land able to absorb or reuse 70% of stormwater through underground storage tanks and tunnels, and use of pervious pavements, in addition to NBS (Chan  et al., 2018; Muggah, 2019). Similarly, several thousand water-sensitive urban design interventions have been implemented across the city of Melbourne (Kuller  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.8_p1,NO_TITLE,"Physical coastal management infrastructure has significant benefits in reducing flood and erosion losses and damage from storms. Physical infrastructure includes seawalls, dikes, breakwaters, revetments, groynes and tidal barriers. Adapted infrastructure can alter risks in morphologically connected areas, and lead to increased residual risk by encouraging more construction in the coastal zone (Miller, Gabe and Sklarz, 2019; Ludy and Kondolf, 2012). The infrastructure is highly cost effective for large settlements, but not always for small settlements (Tiggeloven  et al., 2020) and can be inaccessible to poorer communities (Fletcher  et al., 2016; Pelling and Garschagen, 2019)."

(2020) calculate the cost of adaptation to be USD 176 billion (although this would provide a benefit–cost ratio of 106 under RCP8.5); while Nicholls et al. (2019) estimate that global coastal protection would cost substantially more, up to USD 18.3 trillion between 2015 and 2100 for RCP8.5 (this includes ranges of unit costs and maintenance costs which have often been ignored)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.5.8_p3,NO_TITLE,"Coastal protection infrastructure such as dikes and sluice gates can inhibit salinity intrusion through careful management of water levels, this can provide co-benefits for flood risk reduction and agricultural productivity, but can also have negative impacts on ecosystems (Renaud  et al., 2015).

wg2_ch06_6.3.5.8_p4,NO_TITLE,"Physical infrastructure can provide substantial benefits, be constructed quickly and has enabled coastal cities and settlements around the world to flourish and grow. Multifunctional physical infrastructure can also provide economic and social co-benefits. These include integration of transport, recreation, agriculture (e.g., cattle pasture), founding for wind turbines, housing, office or industry into the coastal management infrastructure (Anvarifar  et al., 2017; Kothuis and Kok, 2017). However, physical infrastructures can also disrupt natural processes, often leading to undesirable impacts such as pollution, degradation of ecosystems and displacement of erosion and flood risk to other locations (Wang  et al., 2018b; Dawson, 2015; Nicholls, Dawson and Day, 2015). Coastal management strategies that take a hybrid approach, integrating physical and natural infrastructure, provide the best opportunities for managing risk and achieving wider socioeconomic and environmental benefits (Depietri and McPhearson, 2017; Morris  et al., 2018; Schoonees  et al., 2019; Powell  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6_p1,6.3.6.1 Equity and Justice ,This section builds on 6.3.4 to offer two entry points for assessing urban adaptation that extend beyond individual infrastructure types and that demonstrate the interdependent and dynamic natures of urban systems.
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Questions of equity and justice influence adaptation pathways for cities, settlements and infrastructure (see also Chapter 8). Although infrastructure, ranging from social to ecological and physical to digital, can help to reduce the impacts of climate change (Stewart and Deng, 2014; Baró Porras  et al., 2021), there is limited evidence of how infrastructures, implemented to reduce climate risk, also reduce inequality. Rather, there is more evidence to suggest that both adaptation plans and associated infrastructure implementation pathways are increasing inequality in cities and settlements (Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Romero-Lankao and Gnatz, 2019). Social, economic and cultural structures that marginalise people by race, class, ethnicity and gender all contribute in complex ways to climate injustices and need to be urgently addressed for adaptation options to shift to benefit those most vulnerable, rather than mainly benefitting the already privileged and maintaining the status quo (Thomas  et al., 2019; Porter  et al., 2020; Ranganathan and Bratman, 2019). Innovation and imagination are needed in adaptation responses to ensure that cities and settlements shift from perpetuating structural domination and inequality to fairer cities (Porter  et al., 2020; Henrique and Tschakert, 2019; Parnell, 2016b). To support these possibilities, this section explores adaptation through the lens of distributive and procedural justice. Although not expanded on here, spatial and recognition injustices are equally important (Fisher, 2015; Chu and Michael, 2018; Campello Torres  et al., 2020). Recognition can be supported through a capabilities approach that helps to bring attention to past cultural domination and enable citizens to develop the functioning life they choose (Schlosberg, Collins and Niemeyer, 2017). This brings a focus on local action, emphasising the relevance to vulnerability reduction and resilience building of individual and local/community capacities and supporting structures. This blurs the distinction between climate change adaptation and community development, with the former firmly embedded in the latter. Struggles for recognition are deeply political and central to adaptation responses which requires increased focus on power to support more equitable and just adaptation (Nightingale, 2017). Justice questions are not static, Box 6.4 overviews the implications of COVID-19 for urban justice and vulnerability."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Distributive justice calls attention to unequal access to urban services, land, capital and technology. Related to this, exposure to health, flooding and drought risks of people living in low-income and informal settlements is a growing concern, as is disaster preparedness and the ability to support the needs of vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and disabled, where data is often lacking (Lilford  et al., 2016; Castro  et al., 2017). There are also differences in who benefits from infrastructures, as they are inherently political, embedded in social contexts, politics and cultural norms (McFarlane and Silver, 2017) and often tend to benefit those already privileged (Henrique and Tschakert, 2019). As an example, fixing water leaks can depend as much on the politics of who is involved and whose knowledge is prioritised as on the technical aspects (Anand, 2015)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The quality and maintenance of infrastructure is often unequal across cities, benefiting some and increasing vulnerability of others. Some property is seen as dangerous and of lower value if highly exposed to risk (Wamsley  et al., 2015). Similarly, areas suffering from disinvestment in infrastructure might have a high risk of flooding (Haddock and Edwards, 2013). Zoning and land use trade-offs have been seen to be unequally skewed in favour of prime real estate and economically valuable assets (e.g., protecting factories and refineries from flooding) (Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015). Urban planning reforms are therefore central to building a fairer urban adaptation response (Parnell, 2016b)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Infrastructure is often not adequately implemented in low-income urban areas and not equally accessible to all (Meller  et al., 2017). For example, low-income neighbourhoods often have less green space and therefore less associated cooling benefits. Even in high-income areas, there is often unequal access to services. For example, an assessment of sustainable urban mobility plans in Portugal showed that some areas have considered equity in their plans and increased access for disadvantaged users including the elderly and disabled, but in other cities this is lacking (Arsenio, Martens and Di Ciommo, 2016). Understanding who has access to what infrastructure can help to redress the drivers of social vulnerability that are central to just urban adaptation (Michael, Deshpande and Ziervogel, 2018; Shi  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Changing land use and increasing green spaces to reduce climate risks and attract investments and job opportunities has increased real estate values, triggered climate gentrification in some areas (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018) and decreased access to affordable housing in other areas (Larsen, 2015; Carter  et al., 2015). Displacement through evictions and relocations linked to land use conversion and resettlement in the name of adaptation has also increased people’s vulnerability (Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Henrique and Tschakert, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Understanding social and economic elites and their investment in infrastructure has implications for distributive justice, particularly when there is secession from public infrastructure services that has financial implications for viability (Romero-Lankao, Gnatz and Sperling, 2016). In the case of the 2015–17 Cape Town drought, wealthy households secured their water needs through off-grid technologies such as rainwater tanks and boreholes. Although this resulted in more water being available in the dams, it also led to less revenue being collected for municipal water and less ability to cross-subsidise water for poor households (Ziervogel, 2019b; Simpson, 2019; Bigger and Millington, 2019). More attention needs to be paid to how shifts in infrastructure are serving the interests of urban elites, often driven by the state, and failing to adequately consider the needs of the disadvantaged (Bulkeley, Castán Broto and Edwards, 2014; Ajibade, 2017; Shi  et al., 2016). Equally, more risk-reducing infrastructure is needed across all urban areas (Reckien  et al., 2018a)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Procedural justice, which focuses on the institutional processes by which adaptation decisions are made, brings attention to the lack of opportunity for engaging in political decision making and limited representation of diverse voices in cities and settlements, and in relation to investment in infrastructure (Coates and Nygren, 2020; Henrique and Tschakert, 2019). Even when inclusive adaptation processes are run, they seldom produce procedurally just outcomes (Malloy and Ashcraft, 2020). Understanding who is excluded and included is important (Sara, Pfeffer and Baud, 2017). One example is the increasing numbers of migrants who are confronted with lack of access to citizenship rights and housing tenure (Romero-Lankao and Norton, 2018). Often, migrants are not allowed to formally claim public provisions in health, finance and shelter (Chu and Michael, 2018). Further, migrants and their settlements are likely unrecognised in spatial or infrastructure development plans. In this context, social infrastructure, zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation has triggered inequity through omission, as some planning process have been racialised and excluded groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities (Anguelovski  et al., 2016). Urban adaptation policy-making processes that explicitly integrate multiple stakeholder interests can help to balance top-down solutions (Reckien  et al., 2018a)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Identifying who is least able to adapt to climate risks sufficiently is important (Thomas  et al., 2019). Some people may have few opportunities to relocate away from flooded areas in the long term or to evacuate in the short term. It is also harder for many from low-income areas to rebuild after an extreme event. Lack of housing tenure and sub-standard housing has been shown to limit the ability of residents to improve and manage their landscapes and therefore it is hard for them to enhance energy efficiency (Dempsey  et al., 2011). Access to information is critical for adapting to climate risk and reducing vulnerability to hazards, yet access to this information is often not equally available (Ma  et al., 2014). For example, low literacy can hamper ability to respond to early warning information (Dugan  et al., 2011). In other instances, racial violence has surfaced during disasters, with Black victims’ lives being seen as less important than others (Anderson  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"When looking at justice issues in urban adaptation, it is important to recognise that the adaptation of one individual or household may lead to maladaptation and negative impacts elsewhere (Holland, 2017; Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017; Atteridge and Remling, 2018). For example, the case of an area of peri-urban Bangkok experiencing localised flooding due to unregulated private sector development saw households take both individual (building flood walls around homes, digging temporary drainage swales in the carriageway) and collective action (petitioning authorities, pumping water into vacant land). These actions, to a certain extent, merely displaced the flood water to other areas, or created new problems by damaging the carriageway, creating negative impacts on other households and the wider community. However, ultimately, it was the actions of improperly regulated private sector developers driving the need for this autonomous adaptation (Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"One of the tensions that emerge when addressing injustice is that the global provision of modern infrastructure is increasingly seen as unfeasible. It is unfeasible, both in terms of the current high emissions associated with infrastructure (World Bank, 2017 ) and the centralised, high standard ideal (Lawhon, Nilsson and Silver, 2018; Coutard and Rutherford, 2015). Decentralisation is increasingly needed, which the urban poor already engage in through their use of ‘informal’ infrastructure technologies, given their limited access to infrastructure networks. Transformative adaptation pathways that reduce climate risk whilst reducing inequity require an approach that sees infrastructure as inherently social and political."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"As analytical concepts, mitigation and adaptation have helped, over the years, to structure thinking and action around climate change. However, since AR5 there has been a growing debate about the adequacy of a neat separation between adaptation and mitigation (Castán Broto, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The delivery of climate change action has revealed numerous co-benefits between adaptation and mitigation, around diverse areas such as implementing NBS and delivering health and development benefits (Ürge-Vorsatz  et al., 2014; Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015; Puppim de Oliveira and Doll, 2016; Spencer  et al., 2017). There has been a strong interest in delivering development benefits alongside climate mitigation, thus benefiting the overall infrastructure base (Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015). Some of these co-benefits have also emerged in experiences of urban planning, pointing toward the dilemma of separating adaptation and mitigation in a context in which integration, rather than an analytical differentiation, was seen as being required to transcend work in silos (Aylett, 2015). Because urban planning needs to carefully consider long time scales, the neat separation between mitigation and adaptation runs counter to integrated forms of planning that can consider scales (time and space) carefully and that are aimed to deliver the sustainable city as a whole (Solecki  et al., 2015; Grafakos  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"For example, the ideas of climate resilient development and climate compatible development help planners to consider the simultaneous wins that emerge between adaptation, mitigation and development, requiring institutional building and partnerships to deliver triple win solutions (Stringer  et al., 2014; Seo, Jaber and Srinivasan, 2017; Mitchell and Maxwell, 2010). While the evidence base for the actual possibility of achieving such triple wins remains scarce (Tompkins  et al., 2013; Sharifi, 2020), emerging examples show important developments. For example, establishing safe and convenient walking and cycling infrastructure can lead to improvements in population health, thereby highlighting the close interaction between urban land use, infrastructure and population health (Schuster  et al., 2017), while clean cooking has the potential to deliver positive health outcomes alongside improvements in air quality and emissions reductions and through reducing pressure on woodland as a fuel source for expanding urban populations (Msoffe, 2017). Furthermore, active transport infrastructure reduces air pollution and related health risks, and helps to mitigate further climate change (Schuster  et al., 2017). These are supported by city networks such as the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration and the Clean Air Coalition that complements WHO guidelines and standards, for example through the Breathe Life Campaign. In conclusion, in both urban environments and infrastructural sectors, triple wins are only realisable through broader perspectives that link climate compatible development to institutional change or the achievements of wider welfare objectives such as those enshrined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda of Development (Castán Broto  et al., 2015; England  et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The aspiration to deliver climate change action within a broader agenda of transformative change, introduced in the SREX report, received renewed attention after the publication of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, which argues for a focus on urban transformations and highlighted that informal settlements were vital for understanding the delivery of these transformations. Deep decarbonisation has emerged as a new idea that regards the development of low or zero carbon pathways as a condition for good adaptation in the long term. Decarbonisation becomes urgent in the face of growing impacts attributable to climate change (Ribera  et al., 2015; Bataille  et al., 2016; Wesseling  et al., 2017). Urbanisation opens opportunities for deep mitigation in low-impact developments, and hence, it is imperative to understand the implications of those opportunities for climate action (Mulugetta and Broto, 2018). These gains are not limited to urban areas. The reliance on connected urban–rural systems for water, food and fuel has led to city government and urban-based businesses supporting landscape adaptations in rural hinterlands with strong potential for mitigation and rural development co-benefits. Water Funds bring downstream urban public and private finance to support upstream rural residents to make land use and agricultural management decisions to avoid damaging runoff, soil erosion and downstream sedimentation with reduction in water quality and increased flood risk. There are more than 30 Water Funds in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. These operate at landscape scale; the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, Kenya (Vogl  et al., 2017), planned for a USD 10 million investment in Water Fund-led conservation interventions, with a projected return of USD 21.5 million in economic benefits over a 30-year timeframe (Apse and Bryant, 2015). However, these investments do not occur where communities lack funding or the institutions to direct funding from downstream beneficiaries to upstream residents (Brauman  et al., 2019)."

Understanding who has access to what infrastructure can help to redress the drivers of social vulnerability that are central to just urban adaptation (Michael, Deshpande and Ziervogel, 2018; Shi  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Changing land use and increasing green spaces to reduce climate risks and attract investments and job opportunities has increased real estate values, triggered climate gentrification in some areas (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018) and decreased access to affordable housing in other areas (Larsen, 2015; Carter  et al., 2015). Displacement through evictions and relocations linked to land use conversion and resettlement in the name of adaptation has also increased people’s vulnerability (Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Henrique and Tschakert, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Understanding social and economic elites and their investment in infrastructure has implications for distributive justice, particularly when there is secession from public infrastructure services that has financial implications for viability (Romero-Lankao, Gnatz and Sperling, 2016). In the case of the 2015–17 Cape Town drought, wealthy households secured their water needs through off-grid technologies such as rainwater tanks and boreholes. Although this resulted in more water being available in the dams, it also led to less revenue being collected for municipal water and less ability to cross-subsidise water for poor households (Ziervogel, 2019b; Simpson, 2019; Bigger and Millington, 2019). More attention needs to be paid to how shifts in infrastructure are serving the interests of urban elites, often driven by the state, and failing to adequately consider the needs of the disadvantaged (Bulkeley, Castán Broto and Edwards, 2014; Ajibade, 2017; Shi  et al., 2016). Equally, more risk-reducing infrastructure is needed across all urban areas (Reckien  et al., 2018a)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Procedural justice, which focuses on the institutional processes by which adaptation decisions are made, brings attention to the lack of opportunity for engaging in political decision making and limited representation of diverse voices in cities and settlements, and in relation to investment in infrastructure (Coates and Nygren, 2020; Henrique and Tschakert, 2019). Even when inclusive adaptation processes are run, they seldom produce procedurally just outcomes (Malloy and Ashcraft, 2020). Understanding who is excluded and included is important (Sara, Pfeffer and Baud, 2017). One example is the increasing numbers of migrants who are confronted with lack of access to citizenship rights and housing tenure (Romero-Lankao and Norton, 2018). Often, migrants are not allowed to formally claim public provisions in health, finance and shelter (Chu and Michael, 2018). Further, migrants and their settlements are likely unrecognised in spatial or infrastructure development plans. In this context, social infrastructure, zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation has triggered inequity through omission, as some planning process have been racialised and excluded groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities (Anguelovski  et al., 2016). Urban adaptation policy-making processes that explicitly integrate multiple stakeholder interests can help to balance top-down solutions (Reckien  et al., 2018a)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Identifying who is least able to adapt to climate risks sufficiently is important (Thomas  et al., 2019). Some people may have few opportunities to relocate away from flooded areas in the long term or to evacuate in the short term. It is also harder for many from low-income areas to rebuild after an extreme event. Lack of housing tenure and sub-standard housing has been shown to limit the ability of residents to improve and manage their landscapes and therefore it is hard for them to enhance energy efficiency (Dempsey  et al., 2011). Access to information is critical for adapting to climate risk and reducing vulnerability to hazards, yet access to this information is often not equally available (Ma  et al., 2014). For example, low literacy can hamper ability to respond to early warning information (Dugan  et al., 2011). In other instances, racial violence has surfaced during disasters, with Black victims’ lives being seen as less important than others (Anderson  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"When looking at justice issues in urban adaptation, it is important to recognise that the adaptation of one individual or household may lead to maladaptation and negative impacts elsewhere (Holland, 2017; Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017; Atteridge and Remling, 2018). For example, the case of an area of peri-urban Bangkok experiencing localised flooding due to unregulated private sector development saw households take both individual (building flood walls around homes, digging temporary drainage swales in the carriageway) and collective action (petitioning authorities, pumping water into vacant land). These actions, to a certain extent, merely displaced the flood water to other areas, or created new problems by damaging the carriageway, creating negative impacts on other households and the wider community. However, ultimately, it was the actions of improperly regulated private sector developers driving the need for this autonomous adaptation (Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"One of the tensions that emerge when addressing injustice is that the global provision of modern infrastructure is increasingly seen as unfeasible. It is unfeasible, both in terms of the current high emissions associated with infrastructure (World Bank, 2017 ) and the centralised, high standard ideal (Lawhon, Nilsson and Silver, 2018; Coutard and Rutherford, 2015). Decentralisation is increasingly needed, which the urban poor already engage in through their use of ‘informal’ infrastructure technologies, given their limited access to infrastructure networks. Transformative adaptation pathways that reduce climate risk whilst reducing inequity require an approach that sees infrastructure as inherently social and political."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"As analytical concepts, mitigation and adaptation have helped, over the years, to structure thinking and action around climate change. However, since AR5 there has been a growing debate about the adequacy of a neat separation between adaptation and mitigation (Castán Broto, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The delivery of climate change action has revealed numerous co-benefits between adaptation and mitigation, around diverse areas such as implementing NBS and delivering health and development benefits (Ürge-Vorsatz  et al., 2014; Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015; Puppim de Oliveira and Doll, 2016; Spencer  et al., 2017). There has been a strong interest in delivering development benefits alongside climate mitigation, thus benefiting the overall infrastructure base (Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015). Some of these co-benefits have also emerged in experiences of urban planning, pointing toward the dilemma of separating adaptation and mitigation in a context in which integration, rather than an analytical differentiation, was seen as being required to transcend work in silos (Aylett, 2015). Because urban planning needs to carefully consider long time scales, the neat separation between mitigation and adaptation runs counter to integrated forms of planning that can consider scales (time and space) carefully and that are aimed to deliver the sustainable city as a whole (Solecki  et al., 2015; Grafakos  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"For example, the ideas of climate resilient development and climate compatible development help planners to consider the simultaneous wins that emerge between adaptation, mitigation and development, requiring institutional building and partnerships to deliver triple win solutions (Stringer  et al., 2014; Seo, Jaber and Srinivasan, 2017; Mitchell and Maxwell, 2010). While the evidence base for the actual possibility of achieving such triple wins remains scarce (Tompkins  et al., 2013; Sharifi, 2020), emerging examples show important developments. For example, establishing safe and convenient walking and cycling infrastructure can lead to improvements in population health, thereby highlighting the close interaction between urban land use, infrastructure and population health (Schuster  et al., 2017), while clean cooking has the potential to deliver positive health outcomes alongside improvements in air quality and emissions reductions and through reducing pressure on woodland as a fuel source for expanding urban populations (Msoffe, 2017). Furthermore, active transport infrastructure reduces air pollution and related health risks, and helps to mitigate further climate change (Schuster  et al., 2017). These are supported by city networks such as the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration and the Clean Air Coalition that complements WHO guidelines and standards, for example through the Breathe Life Campaign. In conclusion, in both urban environments and infrastructural sectors, triple wins are only realisable through broader perspectives that link climate compatible development to institutional change or the achievements of wider welfare objectives such as those enshrined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda of Development (Castán Broto  et al., 2015; England  et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch06_6.3.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The aspiration to deliver climate change action within a broader agenda of transformative change, introduced in the SREX report, received renewed attention after the publication of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, which argues for a focus on urban transformations and highlighted that informal settlements were vital for understanding the delivery of these transformations. Deep decarbonisation has emerged as a new idea that regards the development of low or zero carbon pathways as a condition for good adaptation in the long term. Decarbonisation becomes urgent in the face of growing impacts attributable to climate change (Ribera  et al., 2015; Bataille  et al., 2016; Wesseling  et al., 2017). Urbanisation opens opportunities for deep mitigation in low-impact developments, and hence, it is imperative to understand the implications of those opportunities for climate action (Mulugetta and Broto, 2018). These gains are not limited to urban areas. The reliance on connected urban–rural systems for water, food and fuel has led to city government and urban-based businesses supporting landscape adaptations in rural hinterlands with strong potential for mitigation and rural development co-benefits. Water Funds bring downstream urban public and private finance to support upstream rural residents to make land use and agricultural management decisions to avoid damaging runoff, soil erosion and downstream sedimentation with reduction in water quality and increased flood risk. There are more than 30 Water Funds in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. These operate at landscape scale; the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, Kenya (Vogl  et al., 2017), planned for a USD 10 million investment in Water Fund-led conservation interventions, with a projected return of USD 21.5 million in economic benefits over a 30-year timeframe (Apse and Bryant, 2015). However, these investments do not occur where communities lack funding or the institutions to direct funding from downstream beneficiaries to upstream residents (Brauman  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"COVID-19 impacts have highlighted the depth and unevenness of systemic social vulnerability and the compounding characteristics of contemporary development models, with direct relevance to climate change risk accumulation and its reduction (Patel  et al., 2020b; Manzanedo and Manning, 2020; Bahadur and Dodman, 2020). This is plain at the global level: of the estimated 119–124 million additional people induced into poverty by COVID-19 in 2020, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa each contribute two-fifths (Lakner  et al., 2021). These are rapidly urbanising and highly climate-hazard-exposed world regions, indicating COVID-19 impacts may further concentrate risk in these regions. Within cities, COVID-19 and climate change risk and loss is concurrent by gender, race and income or livelihood, for example, when vulnerable elderly populations are simultaneously exposed to COVID-19 and heatwave risk. Globally, in 2020, about 431.7 million vulnerable people were exposed to extreme heat during the COVID-19 pandemic, including about 75.5 million during the July and August 2020 European heatwave, with an excess mortality of over 9000 people arising from heat exposure (Walton and van Aalst, 2020)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"The pandemic has demonstrated the multiple, often reinforcing, ways in which specific drivers of vulnerability interact both in generating urban risk and shaping who is more or less able to recover (Phillips  et al., 2020; Honey-Rosés  et al., 2020) (see Section 6.2). Again, this is not a new lesson for urban climate change adaptation, but it is a lesson that has not yet been seen to enter into routine practice for urban adaptation. Two key challenges for climate change adaptation are the associations between COVID-19 risk and urban connectivity and overcrowding. Connectivity has been presented in urban adaptation policy as a virtue, a means to share risk and diversity inputs (Ge  et al., 2019; Kim and Bostwick, 2020), COVID-19 has surfaced the unevenness with which people and places are connected and also the need to balance connectivity against risk transfer, through the failure of food supply chains or remittance flows, as well as by the direct transfer of disease (Challinor  et al., 2018). High-density living has advantages for urban resource efficiency including benefiting climate change mitigation. When high-density living is not supported by adequate access to critical infrastructure (sufficient internal living space, access to potable water and sanitation, access to open green space), this exacerbates overcrowding and generates vulnerability to multiple risks, including climate change hazards and communicable disease (Bamweyana  et al., 2020; Hamidi, Sabouri and Ewing, 2020; Peters, 2020; Satterthwaite  et al., 2020). Where overcrowding coincides with precarious livelihoods, for example in informal settlements, risk is further elevated (Wilkinson, 2020). Neighbourhood associations (a benefit of high-density living) have been an important source of resilience through providing trusted information, access to food and water for washing during the pandemic and serving populations unable to access government or market provision (Pelling  et al., 2021). Here local organising has not only met gaps in service provision, but opened dialogue to vision and organise for alternative development futures. These distinctly urban challenges should be read as a sub-set of wider cross-cutting lessons for recovery from COVID-19 (see Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Where responses to COVID-19 include addressing inequities in social infrastructure, this opens a considerable and potentially society-wide opportunity to reduce social vulnerability to climate change risks (see Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7)."

wg2_ch06_6.3.7_p10,NO_TITLE,"Two overarching messages and one key consequence for planning arise from Figure 6.4. First, urban adaptation measures can offer a considerable contribution to CRD. Second, this potential is realised by adaptations that extend predominant physical infrastructure approaches to also deploy nature-based solutions and social interventions. The consequence for planning is support for comprehensive monitoring and joined-up evaluation across the multiple components of CRD, as well as between the sectors that contribute to adaptation."
wg2_ch06_6.3.7_p11,NO_TITLE,"Table 6.6 shows that adapting key grey/physical infrastructure (built form and design, ICT, energy, transport, water and sanitation) is fundamental to CRD. This provides resilience to a range of hazards, with benefits to livelihoods, social capital and health, and provides benefits for the adaptation of other, connected infrastructure systems. Challenges to the contributions of grey/physical infrastructure, where adaptation through nature-based solutions and social policy offer alternatives are a lack of flexibility post-deployment constraining ability to flex as climate and vulnerability change; risk transferred to other people/places, not resolved; negative ecological consequences; and limited evidence of targeting marginality and inequality."
wg2_ch06_6.3.7_p12,NO_TITLE,"The significance of a CRD lens for the evaluation of adaptation strategy can be seen in approaches to riverine and coastal flooding. This viewpoint brings physical (e.g., embankments and defenses), nature-based (e.g., mangrove stands) and social policy (livelihood and social protection) options together. The benefits of physical infrastructure interventions for strengthening existing livelihoods and protecting health, for being deployable at scale and supporting other infrastructures to adapt are recognised and set these against challenges including hazard generation and risk transfer, limited flexibility, ecological harm, carbon costs and an undermining of social inclusion and accountability. Final evaluations will be determined by individual contexts, raising the importance of comprehensive monitoring of existing urban systems adaptation interventions and their association with ongoing development processes and outcomes (see Section 6.4)."
wg2_ch06_6.3.7_p13,NO_TITLE,"The most consistent limit for all urban systems infrastructure types is in risk transfer. Current adaptation approaches in cities, settlements and key infrastructure have a tendency to move risk from one sector or place to others. With the exception of social infrastructure, the observed contribution of adaptation to social transformation is also limited. There are consequences for equity and sustainability as the impacts of climate change increase, and implications for evaluation and planning to work across adaptation interventions and connect with social and environmental policy and practice."
wg2_ch06_6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"This section assesses the effectiveness of efforts to create enabling conditions for adaptation. New policy innovations such as National Urban Policies are emerging to address the multi-level governance demands of climate change (UN-Habitat, 2020; Kinyanjui, 2020). There is no one-size-fits-all approach to deliver adaptation that will fit every case, because the local conditions of implementation bear a strong influence on adaptation’s feasibility and impacts (Archer  et al., 2014). Ways to foster adequate enabling conditions for adaptation are well-documented (IPCC, 2018 Ch.4). These often include integrated planning, multi-agency working and multi-scale and sector action. Existing techniques can be shared and new innovations taken up (Maxwell  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation in urban areas and settlements can be incremental (when it addresses the causes of problems but without fundamentally changing the social and political structures that drive it, for example through planning or new regulations), reformist  (when it changes the features that cause problems but without fundamentally changing the structures) or transformative (when it addresses fundamental systems attributes and outcomes such as reducing inequality in political and socioeconomic structures or enhancing well-being [Mendizabal  et al., 2018; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018 ] which change the situation completely) (Heikkinen, Ylä-Anttila and Juhola, 2019; Roberts and Pelling, 2020; O’Brien, Selboe and Hayward, 2018). In the context of the SGDs mission to leave-no-one behind, transformative adaptation addresses fundamental systems’ functions to enable enhanced social justice and socio-ecological well-being. Incremental adaptation actions seek to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation that seeks only to defend existing development status will not contribute to enhanced well-being and is not transformative, even if fundamental infrastructure engineering or legislative systems are changed to maintain the status quo in the face of increasing risk (Mendizabal  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"City populations and non-state actors, together with local and regional governments, can play an essential role in creating enabling conditions for action, including, for example, civil society mobilising concerns of marginalised voices and future generations, as indicated in the worldwide student mobilisations against climate change (Wood, 2019; Maor, Tosun and Jordan, 2017; Cloutier, Papin and Bizier, 2018; Prendergast  et al., 2021), which may then be prioritised by local and regional governments. National governments also play a crucial role, for example in facilitating resources and finance for urban adaptation actions, alongside financial organisations and the business sector (see Section 6.4.5). This section starts assessing adaptation experiences in cities, settlements and infrastructures since the AR5, before reviewing evidence of how to foster enabling conditions for adaptation through institutionalisation, governance capacity, finance, evaluation and social learning."

This section assesses the contributions of key urban actors, local government, civil society and the local private sector, in enabling adaptation. Wider influences from national government cross cut this and are discussed with the role of international agencies, and finance which is assessed in Section 6.4.5."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1_p2,6.4.1.1 Experiences of Adaptation Action in Sub-national Governments ,"The literature on the governance of adaptation has grown since the AR5, though with few cases from cities and settlements in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and former USSR countries. Potential reasons for the continued lack of studies in these areas include the centralised character of decision making systems in countries in these regions and the early stage of adaptation planning in these urban areas (Clar, 2019; Mitchell and Laycock, 2019; Olazabal  et al., 2019a)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1_p3,6.4.1.1 Experiences of Adaptation Action in Sub-national Governments ,"Flexible institutions that allow for both top-down and bottom-up action can bring capacities together from across levels of government and actors within a settlement (Sharifi and Yamagata, 2017). Predominant planning and capacity-building strategies, however, lack the flexibility to address the needs of a rapidly changing environment (Carter  et al., 2015; Dhar and Khirfan, 2017; Juhola, 2016). Efforts to adapt to new challenges may have to speed up. This is especially true in urban areas and settlements with lower levels of development and experiencing rapid urbanisation, growing inequality and exposure to multiple hazards (Dulal, 2019; Grafakos  et al., 2019; Solecki  et al., 2018). Even within cities that share similar characteristics, there are considerable differences in the level of investment in adaptation (Georgeson  et al., 2016). There is also a danger that uncoordinated actions for climate change mitigation and adaptation may constrain future adaptation opportunities or create maladaptation (Juhola  et al., 2016). The evidence emerging since the AR5 suggests that institutional change can be accelerated by closer collaboration between the diverse actors and deployment of the diverse approaches that can deliver adaptation."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The assessment of cases of local adaptation demonstrates that most urban adaptation is led by local governments (although the local government is also a heterogeneous category and local governance arrangements may vary across administrative and political contexts) (high confidence) (Amundsen  et al., 2018; Lesnikowski  et al., 2021). Local government reform at different levels can improve local adaptation, whether this is by strengthening specific teams or building cross-departmental linkages (high confidence) (Paterson  et al., 2017; Shi, 2019; Wamsler and Raggers, 2018). Adaptation success often depends on having political champions driving the adaptation agenda alongside measures such as access to a knowledge base, resources at hand, political stability and the presence of dense social networks that can be supported through local government reform (Pasquini  et al., 2015). Aligning adaptation objectives with other potential benefits of sustainable development also supports adaptation. Specifically, policies and plans that link adaptation to the objectives of Agenda 2030 supports action at the local level (UN-Habitat, 2016b). Showing the economic benefits of adaptation is a strategy for local institutions to gain support for adaptation action. For example, local governments in Surat, Indore and Bhubaneswar in India linked adaptation to local development needs in experiments that facilitated accessing human and finance resources, at the local, national and international levels (Chu, 2016). However, linking adaptation to co-benefits may also divide efforts and reduce the effectiveness of adaptation actions. For example, urban land use planning and management in Ambo town, Ethiopia, resulted in the implementation of urban greening projects, but these projects did not directly address the climate-related disaster risks affecting the settlement, including urban flooding, water stress, water shortages, increased urban heat, wind and dust storms (Ogato  et al., 2017)."

Effective action by local government requires national government’s support (medium confidence). For example, Araos et al. (2017) documents the case of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a national plan prioritises measures for protecting coasts and agricultural production. In this context, the local government has minimal access to human and financial resources. Without national support, the local government struggles to coordinate action among different stakeholders. National urban adaptation directives can influence municipal governments’ action and planning, but evidence suggests that national policy alone is not sufficient to deliver action on the ground without understanding local conditions (high confidence) (Archer  et al., 2014; Lehmann  et al., 2015)."

Often, a focus on institutional change and reform limits attention to more practical aspects of adaptation that improve communities’ resilience (Castán Broto and Westman, 2020). Adaptation actions, even where financed effectively, do not always deliver positive outcomes (high confidence) (Reckien  et al., 2015; Woodruff and Stults, 2016; Uittenbroek, 2016; Aguiar  et al., 2018; Reckien  et al., 2018a; Olazabal  et al., 2019b; Campello Torres  et al., 2021) (see also Section 6.4.7)."

Previous IPCC Assessment Reports noted that civil society actors enable local risk awareness, sensitisation and adaptive capacity, and generate locally based innovation (e.g., through community based adaptation programmes)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Community based adaptation includes a range of initiatives that put communities at the centre of planning for adaptation, often led by communities themselves (Reid, 2016). Community based adaptation is a comprehensive and effective strategy to deliver resilience at a human scale (Trogal  et al., 2018; Greenwalt  et al., 2020). Many community based responses to climate impacts represent coping strategies developed within households with a small effect on adaptation capacities beyond incremental improvements. Residents adopt private coping strategies to reduce exposure to and the impacts of heat, floods, flash floods, landslides, storms and diseases on their lives (Hambati and Yengoh, 2018). These coping strategies include the construction of physical protection against flooding, reforestation, the construction of terraces, flood diversion measures and interventions to protect houses (such as raised doorsteps or use of sandbags and adoption of building techniques for making homes resilient to storms and landslides), ventilation of houses, urban agriculture and redefinition of daily practices and livelihoods (Navarro  et al., 2020; Malabayabas and Baconguis, 2017; Apreda, 2016; de Andrade and Szlafsztein, 2020; Sahay, 2018; Bausch, Eakin and Lerner, 2018)."

However, individual coping strategies can provide foundations for the implementation of collaborative action in communities, building on people’s experiences, in ways which may have a longer-term, durable impact on developing resilience (high confidence) (McEwen  et al., 2018). Community based adaptation can be effective at different scales, whether this is to manage transboundary issues (Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017), support the replication of local solutions (Danière  et al., 2016), increase the uptake of adaptation measures (Liang  et al., 2017) or inform the design of more effective policies for resilience (Berquist, Daniere and Drummond, 2015; Odemerho, 2015).

The absence of private sector investment in adaptation is particularly visible in rapidly urbanising countries (Nagendra  et al., 2018). Business continuity describing private sector preparedness notes that firms underestimate the impacts of climate risks on their business models (Goldstein  et al., 2019; Forino and von Meding, 2021; Korber and McNaughton, 2017; Crick  et al., 2018b). There is little research on how businesses can play a leading role in urban adaptation (Klein  et al., 2018). A global assessment of the private sector’s role in urban adaptation using data from 402 cities shows that most adaptation projects focus on the public sector and do not address private sector concerns or local people’s participation (Klein  et al., 2018). Recorded private sector action is recognised through partnerships and participation (Peterson and Hughes, 2017; Hughes and Peterson, 2018). There are a few examples of studies of private sector-led adaptation action which adopts a national focus (Crick  et al., 2018a; Crick  et al., 2018b). This lack of evidence contrasts with a well-developed body of literature on private sector-led mitigation (Averchenkova  et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Businesses have an essential role in urban adaptation actions, through the collective formulation of adaptation strategies, the provision of critical adaptive interventions and collaboration in partnerships. Businesses in the property sector, such as real estate developers, are on the frontline of climate change impacts but display differing attitudes toward climate adaptation. A study of property businesses in cities in Australia (Taylor  et al., 2012) showed that speeding up planning approval processes facilitated adaptation actions, and joint private–public decision-making was the preferred mode of governance for responding to climate concerns. Property businesses in cities in Sweden had a limited and reactive engagement in climate issues and resisted regulation (Storbjörk et al., 2018). Corporate, private sector interventions in urban risk reduction more broadly remain limited, with a mix of public and private responsibility for planning, implementing and maintaining adaptations in the built environment, and yet limited engagement of private sector actors in providing healthcare measures for heat prevention (medium confidence) (Mees, 2017)."

Firms have varying abilities to introduce climate adaptation measures related to staff availability, levels of awareness, perceptions of responsibility and duration of contracts (short-term projects implies less interest in adaptation outcomes) (Shearer  et al., 2016). The impact of COVID-19 has serious but uncertain implications for both access to finances for sustainable development by LMICs and sub-national governments, and the possibility of stimulating maladaptive infrastructure and policy responses (OECD, 2020; Sovacool, Del Rio and Griffiths, 2020). The response of businesses to disasters influences the resilience in the communities in which they operate (McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2016; Linnenluecke and McKnight, 2017). However, at the same time there is a growing literature that warns against the conflict interests that businesses may have in their adaptation strategies. For example, real estate responses to flooding have led to processes of climate gentrification, whereby lower income populations are displaced toward higher risk areas which stablishes racialised and class-based patterns of inequality of exposure to risk, with hard evidence rapidly growing specially in US cities (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018a; Shokry, Connolly and Anguelovski, 2020; De Koning and Filatova, 2020; Aune, Gesch and Smith, 2020). Private-sector participation in adaptation solutions depend on having mechanisms to enable transparency and open reporting on the nature of support and the solutions proposed. For example, businesses adopting ‘community-centric’ disaster management strategies can assist local recovery efforts by protecting employment, provision of emergency supplies and participation in reparations (McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2016). Private sector actors engaged in community climate responses can play a role in funding and managing programmes that address public health and education concerns. The potential of ecopreneurship, social enterprises, cooperatives and other sustainability-oriented business models (Schaltegger, Hansen and Lüdeke-Freund, 2016; Lopes  et al., 2020; Battaglia, Gragnani and Annesi, 2020) for urban adaptation remains under-explored in the literature on urban climate governance."

Rotterdam has created an institutional environment that favours eco-innovation (Huang-Lachmann and Lovett, 2016). The municipal government works directly with the private sector to enhance protection against flooding constructing a marketing strategy around a ‘floating city’ concept. A ‘floating housing’ market has expanded, with benefits for the local real estate and construction industries and knowledge-exporting businesses that provide consultation expertise, delta technologies and architectural models.

Navigating the inclusion of businesses in urban planning processes requires local authorities to engage in ongoing negotiations, to reflect on constantly shifting power balances and to move delicately between the role of regulator and facilitator in the process of defining and maintaining long-term objectives (Storbjörk, Hjerpe and Glaas, 2019b; Storbjörk, Hjerpe and Glaas, 2019a)."

Partnerships can support capacity building in public and private organisations and facilitate networking efforts that extend beyond the private sector to communities and NGOs (Bauer and Steurer, 2014; Castán Broto  et al., 2015). Public actors can benefit from the private sector’s innovation and implementation capacity, and businesses can de-risk investments. Still, partnerships can also strengthen the ideologies of growth and managerialism within the operations of the local government (Taylor  et al., 2012). Reconciling divergent norms and routines within public and private organisations remains one of the challenges to establishing successful public–private partnerships for adaptation (Lund, 2018). Administrative and political culture influences the nature of interactions between public and private sector actors in urban adaptation agendas (Bauer and Steurer, 2014), with negative consequences such as the imposition of vertical chains of commands on horizontal collaborations, and the need to formalise contractual relations (Klein and Juhola, 2018)."

Recently, TMNs have taken on more programmatic functions, working with cities to strategise, plan and incrementally improve their organisation functions in the face of climate change. For example, the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities program (2014–2019) provided a two-year salary for a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to be situated in a municipal authority to bridge silos, incentivise change and develop development strategies for resilience (Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Spaans and Waterhout, 2017). In these cases, external actors have enabled broad organisation change, resource mobilisation pathways and alternative forms of agenda-setting in cities (Chu, 2018; Hakelberg, 2014) (see also Case Study 6.2, Semarang)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"A range of TMNs also support and encourage cities and settlements to plan and implement adaptation actions. ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability has developed protocols and implemented projects for member cities. The C40 Climate Leadership Group has facilitated the coordination of both local governments and business actors at a global scale (Gordon, 2020). Policy coordination has been central to the signatories of the Covenant of Mayors (Domorenok  et al., 2020). Such networks can encourage the sharing of information about appropriate practices between urban areas; contribute to goal setting; support experimentation and development of new policy instruments; enhance stakeholder engagement; institutionalise climate agendas; and encourage policy integration across governance levels and sectors (Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Busch, Bendlin and Fenton, 2018; Fünfgeld, 2015; Busch, 2015; Papin, 2019; Rashidi and Patt, 2018).

A recent comparative study of 337 cities found out that cities that participation in TNMs are more likely to take adaptation action and that being part of multiple networks leads to higher levels of adaptation planning (Heikkinen  et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The assessment of cases of local adaptation demonstrates that most urban adaptation is led by local governments (although the local government is also a heterogeneous category and local governance arrangements may vary across administrative and political contexts) (high confidence) (Amundsen  et al., 2018; Lesnikowski  et al., 2021). Local government reform at different levels can improve local adaptation, whether this is by strengthening specific teams or building cross-departmental linkages (high confidence) (Paterson  et al., 2017; Shi, 2019; Wamsler and Raggers, 2018). Adaptation success often depends on having political champions driving the adaptation agenda alongside measures such as access to a knowledge base, resources at hand, political stability and the presence of dense social networks that can be supported through local government reform (Pasquini  et al., 2015). Aligning adaptation objectives with other potential benefits of sustainable development also supports adaptation. Specifically, policies and plans that link adaptation to the objectives of Agenda 2030 supports action at the local level (UN-Habitat, 2016b). Showing the economic benefits of adaptation is a strategy for local institutions to gain support for adaptation action. For example, local governments in Surat, Indore and Bhubaneswar in India linked adaptation to local development needs in experiments that facilitated accessing human and finance resources, at the local, national and international levels (Chu, 2016). However, linking adaptation to co-benefits may also divide efforts and reduce the effectiveness of adaptation actions. For example, urban land use planning and management in Ambo town, Ethiopia, resulted in the implementation of urban greening projects, but these projects did not directly address the climate-related disaster risks affecting the settlement, including urban flooding, water stress, water shortages, increased urban heat, wind and dust storms (Ogato  et al., 2017)."

Effective action by local government requires national government’s support (medium confidence). For example, Araos et al. (2017) documents the case of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a national plan prioritises measures for protecting coasts and agricultural production. In this context, the local government has minimal access to human and financial resources. Without national support, the local government struggles to coordinate action among different stakeholders.

Often, a focus on institutional change and reform limits attention to more practical aspects of adaptation that improve communities’ resilience (Castán Broto and Westman, 2020). Adaptation actions, even where financed effectively, do not always deliver positive outcomes (high confidence) (Reckien  et al., 2015; Woodruff and Stults, 2016; Uittenbroek, 2016; Aguiar  et al., 2018; Reckien  et al., 2018a; Olazabal  et al., 2019b; Campello Torres  et al., 2021) (see also Section 6.4.7)."

Community based adaptation is a comprehensive and effective strategy to deliver resilience at a human scale (Trogal  et al., 2018; Greenwalt  et al., 2020). Many community based responses to climate impacts represent coping strategies developed within households with a small effect on adaptation capacities beyond incremental improvements. Residents adopt private coping strategies to reduce exposure to and the impacts of heat, floods, flash floods, landslides, storms and diseases on their lives (Hambati and Yengoh, 2018). These coping strategies include the construction of physical protection against flooding, reforestation, the construction of terraces, flood diversion measures and interventions to protect houses (such as raised doorsteps or use of sandbags and adoption of building techniques for making homes resilient to storms and landslides), ventilation of houses, urban agriculture and redefinition of daily practices and livelihoods (Navarro  et al., 2020; Malabayabas and Baconguis, 2017; Apreda, 2016; de Andrade and Szlafsztein, 2020; Sahay, 2018; Bausch, Eakin and Lerner, 2018)."

However, individual coping strategies can provide foundations for the implementation of collaborative action in communities, building on people’s experiences, in ways which may have a longer-term, durable impact on developing resilience (high confidence) (McEwen  et al., 2018). Community based adaptation can be effective at different scales, whether this is to manage transboundary issues (Limthongsakul, Nitivattananon and Arifwidodo, 2017), support the replication of local solutions (Danière  et al., 2016), increase the uptake of adaptation measures (Liang  et al., 2017) or inform the design of more effective policies for resilience (Berquist, Daniere and Drummond, 2015; Odemerho, 2015).

Ideas of modernist planning influenced the development of new water infrastructure and piped networks, including the first piped infrastructure, bringing water from sources 30 km away, including the Hesaraghatta and then the TG Halli reservoirs. The old network of tanks gradually deteriorated as tanks became disused, polluted or built over. More prolonged and costly water transfers took place in the post-colonial period, delivering water from the Cauvery River in a massive engineering project with a high energetic cost and enmeshed in inter-state conflicts over water use (Castán Broto and Sudhira, 2019). Scarcity is still a problem in Bengaluru. The citizen response has been an activist movement to reclaim the city’s tanks, accompanied by a plea to reconsider current water uses within the city, including actions to protect and rejuvenate water wells (Nagendra, 2016). Unnikrishnan et al. (2018) document different actions led by citizen-led collectives, including projects for lake rejuvenation, filtering technologies to treat sewage, recovering the value of lakes through a share of photos and art projects, and involvement of local knowledge in-tank restoration. Those efforts suggest an untapped potential to deliver adaptive green spaces through the recovery of Bengaluru’s tanks."
wg2_ch06_6.4.2_p1,6.4.2.1 Input-Driven Institutional Change ,"The main barriers to urban climate adaptation, and strategies to address them, relate to institutional change (high confidence) (see Table 6.7). Institutions include legislative and policy frameworks and guidelines intended to direct the action of government, civil society and private sector organisations and extend into informal and customary practices that shape individual behaviour. Many of the barriers that inhibit institutions acting in ways that can support action for inclusive and sustainable adaptation have historical roots, grounded in complex political and social relations and can be reinforcing (Table 6.7). Overcoming these barriers requires coordinating the activities of multiple actors who can facilitate institutional and political change (Eisenack  et al., 2014)."

wg2_ch06_6.4.2_p5,6.4.2.1 Input-Driven Institutional Change ,"Institutional change refers to processes that aim to shift existing norms and practices within organisations to deliver more effective action for adaptation. Institutional change at the local level can be achieved with diverse strategies (Patterson, de Voogt and Sapiains, 2019). Table 6.7 illustrates various instruments that enable the institutionalisation of climate adaptation concerns into policy and planning. As Table 6.7 shows, institutional change is often used as synonymous with mainstreaming. Both terms refer to the integration of climate adaptation concerns into other areas of work and as part of practical routines and arguments (Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016; Storbjörk and Uggla, 2015; Runhaar  et al., 2018; Uittenbroek  et al., 2014). Early assessments understood mainstreaming as activities that integrate climate adaptation into long-range and sectoral plans (Anguelovski and Carmin, 2011; Aylett, 2015). Since then, efforts to mainstream climate adaptation have grown into agendas around the community and economic development (Ayers  et al., 2014), climate mitigation (Göpfert, Wamsler and Lang, 2019), spatial and infrastructure planning (Anguelovski, Chu and Carmin, 2014), urban finance (Musah-Surugu  et al., 2018; Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019), public health (Araos  et al., 2015), environmental management (Wamsler, 2015; Kabisch  et al., 2016) and multi-level decision making (Ojea, 2015; Visseren-Hamakers, 2015). Such efforts require various degrees of regulatory or programmatic action to integrate adaptation with other concerns (Wamsler and Pauleit, 2016). However, institutional change has a broader remit than mainstreaming adaptation, as it may include, for example, changing the organisations already dealing with climate adaptation and make them more effective including changes in inputs, procedures and options (Patterson, de Voogt and Sapiains, 2019)."

ReResearch conducted across two municipalities in Western Cape, South Africa, showed the importance of a dedicated environmental champion, access to a knowledge base, the availability of resources, political stability and the presence of dense social networks (Pasquini  et al., 2015).

Internal networks can facilitate the commitment of local elected officials (Hughes, 2015), support higher municipal expenditures per capita and foster perceptions that climate adaptation is needed (Shi, Chu and Debats, 2015). Collective decision-making can integrate multiple types of information with moral concerns and provide key rationales that enable adaptation action (Carlson and McCormick, 2015). In urban areas in Africa, research on internal networks has also investigated how informal arrangements shape action possibilities (Satterthwaite  et al., 2020). For example, in Zimbabwe, informal, traditional and civil society institutions are core arenas for issue discussion because of lower public sector capacities (Mubaya and Mafongoya, 2017). In Durban, South Africa, local governments rely considerably on shadow systems and informal spaces of information and knowledge exchange across their operations to introduce and sustain new ideas (Leck and Roberts, 2015). In the metropolitan area of Styria, Austria, informal cooperation has supported the development of rural–urban partnerships for the formulation of common goals (Oedl-Wieser  et al., 2020).

For example, Manizales, Colombia has included climate adaptation into long-established environmental policy (Biomanizales) and a local environmental action plan (Bioplan), which follows on from a long coherent trajectory of climate change policy (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2014). A significant number of North American cities have integrated adaptation into long-range plans, while fewer cities integrate adaptation in sustainable development plans or sectoral plans (Aylett, 2015). Canadian cities are more likely to have a plan specifically focused on adaptation rather than having adaptation integrated into municipal long-range planning (Aylett, 2015).

wg2_ch06_6.4.3_p1,6.4.3.1 Delivers on the Needs of the Most Vulnerable ,"A policy action gap arises when administrative, communication, financial and other organisational blockages and inertia interrupt implementation of policy, the intent of political leadership and delivery of adaptation interventions on the ground (Ampaire  et al., 2017; Bell, 2018; Shi, 2019). Political and policy confidence are key enabling conditions for adaptation decision making. As the AR5 already acknowledged, political inaction can arise where there is low confidence that adaptation actions can deliver a safer future for all (Chan  et al., 2015a). For example, in some administrative jurisdictions (most of them local governments), calls by social movements for the adoption of Climate Emergency Declarations were addressed, however, practical outcomes in terms of adaptation have been limited, and may have foreclosed other future local actions (Nissen  et al., 2020; Ruiz Campillo, Castán Broto and Westman, 2020) and raised concerns about maladaptation (Long and Rice, 2019). Political inaction for climate justice is particularly visible in contexts of informality (Ziervogel, 2020). Studies of city and local authority decision-making in South America (Di Giulio  et al., 2019), Asia (Araos  et al., 2017) and Europe (Lesnikowski  et al., 2021) indicate that where there is insufficient political will (that is lack of prioritisation of the issue and inadequate allocation of resources including staffing and finance) and lack of inclusive, coordinated leadership, it can be difficult to overcome inaction, generating a policy action gap."
wg2_ch06_6.4.3_p2,6.4.3.1 Delivers on the Needs of the Most Vulnerable ,"Multiple actors contribute to deliver climate change adaptation (Chan  et al., 2015a; Bäckstrand  et al., 2017). There are also multiple scales of action, from the provision of local services to large infrastructures of national or even international significance. Figure 6.5 provides an insight into the challenges that shape the policy action gap and a range of strategies that can help bridge policy action gaps. Effective adaptation governance will depend on the compound impact of the actions of multiple agents operating at different scales (medium confidence, medium agreement ) (Di Giulio  et al., 2019; Hale  et al., 2021; Zwierzchowska  et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Success in urban adaptation is most often understood as requiring measurable outcomes and evaluation (see also Section 6.4.6). However, many adaptation outcomes are not measurable (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Béné et al., 2018). Adaptation action solely focused on action tends to ignore areas in the city for which there is no existing data even though actions in these areas may play an essential role in shaping resilience and its limits. Informal settlements and informal economies, which are integral in managing urban resources for effective climate adaptation, are not routinely included in formal urban and national monitoring(Guibrunet and Castán Broto, 2016). The resulting understanding and monitoring of city needs, capacities and actions that feed into policy is incomplete. The innovation, as well as particular concerns and capacities of the informal sector, which is often highly gendered, are not always measured (Brown and McGranahan, 2016). An emphasis on measurable adaptation outcomes may lead to prioritising techno-economic measures to adaptation at the local level. Technocratic approaches to environmental policy continue to shape local sustainability politics (Bulkeley, 2015). The deployment of such technocratic approaches at the local scale is detrimental for democratic and collaborative practices (Metzger and Lindblad, 2020). For example, while China has received praise in terms of delivering urban policies that put climate change at its core, thus suggesting its role providing leadership in climate change debates (Liu  et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2015; Fu and Zhang, 2017), other analyses suggest that processes of planning should take greater account of certain groups and interests (Westman and Broto, 2018). Urban sustainability policy may, as a result, fail to deliver collaborative social and environmental objectives, and this is maladaptive in terms of CRD."
wg2_ch06_6.4.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Two forms of mainstreaming are usually found in urban policy: incorporating climate adaptation into different sectors or incorporating climate adaptation in holistic sustainability or resilience plans, linking climate adaptation objectives with other social and development objectives (Reckien  et al., 2019; Fainstein, 2018). The integration of climate adaptation in local policies in cities and settlements has often been seen as maintaining business-as-usual and not always aligned with transformative efforts to address structural drivers of vulnerability (high confidence). For example, mainstream actions that seek to advance other development objectives, as explained above, may reduce adaptation to ‘low-hanging fruits’, which may maintain business-as-usual practices without any fundamental transformation of the social, institutional and economic systems that drive vulnerabilities (Aylett, 2014). However, as explained above, mainstreaming can also generate wider processes of institutional change (Section 6.4.2). Mainstream strategies may help to demonstrate how policy and frameworks can produce practical outcomes on the ground (Biesbroek and Delaney, 2020). However, previous experiences in other sectors, such as gender mainstreaming, have shown the limitations of the mainstreaming approach, particularly in terms of addressing the structural drivers of inequality and vulnerability, and in achieving justice for those who suffer most (Moser, 2017). Local governments in particular, can link mainstreaming efforts with specific strategies that support justice in adaptation, including redistribution efforts to address vulnerabilities (see Section 6.3.2), representation in local institution and deliberative processes, and recognition of the conditions for self-realisation, including personal and collective safety (Agyeman  et al., 2016; Castán Broto and Westman, 2017; Castán Broto and Westman, 2019; Hess and McKane, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Coordination of adaptation policy goals cuts across cities to integrate them into international processes of climate policy formulation; coordination in cities produces effective collective outcomes, cementation of common standards and methodologies for climate action (e.g., emission inventories) (high agreement , medium evidence) (Gordon and Johnson, 2017; Hsu and Rauber, 2021). A collective global response has become a significant concern in international climate policy (Chan  et al., 2015a). The UNFCCC has adopted a role as an orchestrator, including providing framework for city governments (Bäckstrand and Kuyper, 2017). Within cities, coordination can arise from active programming; for example, in Rotterdam and New York City, local authorities adopted long-term objectives and conditions for action, bringing together a multiplicity of actors across sectors to orient contributions, share knowledge and coordinate actions (Hölscher  et al., 2019). Where national politics is supportive, coordination between city and national government is an asset (Chan and Amling, 2019; Inch, 2019). The use of social media and digital mechanisms for coordination with public interest is ambiguous: in China, Weibo has facilitated an expansion of public engagement, although it remains top down and dominated by a few influencial actors (Liu and Zhao, 2017; Yang and Stoddart, 2021). The pilot project #OurChangingClimate is one example of engaging youth with an understanding of their communities and their resilience or vulnerability to climate change (Napawan, Simpson and Snyder, 2017)."

Co-production involves the active involvement of citizens and citizens’ organisation in iterative public service planning and delivery, and has become increasingly central in climate change responses alongside other bottom-up, community-led strategies (Bremer  et al., 2019; Vasconcelos, Santos and Pacheco, 2013)."

For example, in three cities across the Czech Republic, stakeholder participation exercises were used to prioritise climate change risks, provide impetus and opportunity for knowledge co-production, and support adaptation planning (Krkoška Lorencová et al., 2018). In municipalities in Malaysia, stakeholders and citizens are active in the adaptation policy cycle (Palermo and Hernandez, 2020). In Quebec, Canada, citizens collaborated with the municipal authority to bring together climate science and ‘ordinary’ urban management and design solutions (Cloutier  et al., 2015). Service co-production enables integrating multiple actors in the management and delivery of public services (Pestoff and Brandsen, 2013; Pestoff, Brandsen and Verschuere, 2013). Civil society-driven, co-productive approaches can pioneer new forms of institutional relations and practices filling gaps where the public sector is absent or retreating (Frantzeskaki  et al., 2016)."

These movements have built momentum moving local governments and other institutions to declare a climate emergency and have supported the creation of new forums where climate change can be addressed collectively, such as citizens’ assemblies. In the UK, for example, initial scepticism has led to the proliferation of citizen-centric Climate Assemblies at the local level (Sandover, Moseley and Devine-Wright, 2021)."

Experiences of co-production of sanitation services show how co-production may improve outcomes, while at the same time opening up avenues for grassroots organisations to claim political influence (McGranahan and Mitlin, 2016). Co-production may change institutions in response to external interventions (Das, 2016). Although there are drawbacks in terms of the extent to which co-production can be used to legitimise unfair interventions within a given context, co-production may also be a tool for improving the accountability of dominant groups to vulnerable sectors of the population (Nastiti  et al., 2017). There are limitations to co-production. The city of Barcelona, Spain, used co-production methodologies to develop the Barcelona Climate Plan. However, policymakers and civil servants were reluctant to use lay knowledge from participants and political deadlines constrained the time dedicated to deliberation (Satorras  et al., 2020)."

Slogans such as ‘leave no one behind’ embedded in international policy for cities and settlements recognise the connection between systems of oppression and exclusion that reproduce and perpetuate urban inequality and the delivery of urban services and security (Kabeer, 2016; Stuart and Woodroffe, 2016)."

For example, fisherwomen in the western coast of India rely on a complex arrangement of relationships around categories of class, caste and gender that shapes their possibilities to draw political resources to maintain their livelihoods and, hence, influence the dynamics of transformation (Thara, 2016). Intersectionality is central to build resilience across communities, rather than in particular areas (Khosla and Masaud, 2010; Reckien  et al., 2017). Including intersectionality deliberately in partnerships with communities can empower socially excluded groups and highlight justice issues while aligning agendas with local development priorities (Castán Broto  et al., 2015a). Despite the high confidence on the growing importance of intersectionality concerns in the delivery of just environmental policies, there is limited evidence of its explicit inclusion in adaptation policies."

The integration of climate adaptation in local policies in cities and settlements has often been seen as maintaining business-as-usual and not always aligned with transformative efforts to address structural drivers of vulnerability (high confidence). For example, mainstream actions that seek to advance other development objectives, as explained above, may reduce adaptation to ‘low-hanging fruits’, which may maintain business-as-usual practices without any fundamental transformation of the social, institutional and economic systems that drive vulnerabilities (Aylett, 2014). However, as explained above, mainstreaming can also generate wider processes of institutional change (Section 6.4.2). Mainstream strategies may help to demonstrate how policy and frameworks can produce practical outcomes on the ground (Biesbroek and Delaney, 2020). However, previous experiences in other sectors, such as gender mainstreaming, have shown the limitations of the mainstreaming approach, particularly in terms of addressing the structural drivers of inequality and vulnerability, and in achieving justice for those who suffer most (Moser, 2017). Local governments in particular, can link mainstreaming efforts with specific strategies that support justice in adaptation, including redistribution efforts to address vulnerabilities (see Section 6.3.2), representation in local institution and deliberative processes, and recognition of the conditions for self-realisation, including personal and collective safety (Agyeman  et al., 2016; Castán Broto and Westman, 2017; Castán Broto and Westman, 2019; Hess and McKane, 2021)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Coordination of adaptation policy goals cuts across cities to integrate them into international processes of climate policy formulation; coordination in cities produces effective collective outcomes, cementation of common standards and methodologies for climate action (e.g., emission inventories) (high agreement , medium evidence) (Gordon and Johnson, 2017; Hsu and Rauber, 2021). A collective global response has become a significant concern in international climate policy (Chan  et al., 2015a). The UNFCCC has adopted a role as an orchestrator, including providing framework for city governments (Bäckstrand and Kuyper, 2017). Within cities, coordination can arise from active programming; for example, in Rotterdam and New York City, local authorities adopted long-term objectives and conditions for action, bringing together a multiplicity of actors across sectors to orient contributions, share knowledge and coordinate actions (Hölscher  et al., 2019). Where national politics is supportive, coordination between city and national government is an asset (Chan and Amling, 2019; Inch, 2019). The use of social media and digital mechanisms for coordination with public interest is ambiguous: in China, Weibo has facilitated an expansion of public engagement, although it remains top down and dominated by a few influencial actors (Liu and Zhao, 2017; Yang and Stoddart, 2021). The pilot project #OurChangingClimate is one example of engaging youth with an understanding of their communities and their resilience or vulnerability to climate change (Napawan, Simpson and Snyder, 2017)."

Co-production involves the active involvement of citizens and citizens’ organisation in iterative public service planning and delivery, and has become increasingly central in climate change responses alongside other bottom-up, community-led strategies (Bremer  et al., 2019; Vasconcelos, Santos and Pacheco, 2013)."

For example, in three cities across the Czech Republic, stakeholder participation exercises were used to prioritise climate change risks, provide impetus and opportunity for knowledge co-production, and support adaptation planning (Krkoška Lorencová et al., 2018). In municipalities in Malaysia, stakeholders and citizens are active in the adaptation policy cycle (Palermo and Hernandez, 2020). In Quebec, Canada, citizens collaborated with the municipal authority to bring together climate science and ‘ordinary’ urban management and design solutions (Cloutier  et al., 2015). Service co-production enables integrating multiple actors in the management and delivery of public services (Pestoff and Brandsen, 2013; Pestoff, Brandsen and Verschuere, 2013). Civil society-driven, co-productive approaches can pioneer new forms of institutional relations and practices filling gaps where the public sector is absent or retreating (Frantzeskaki  et al., 2016)."

These movements have built momentum moving local governments and other institutions to declare a climate emergency and have supported the creation of new forums where climate change can be addressed collectively, such as citizens’ assemblies. In the UK, for example, initial scepticism has led to the proliferation of citizen-centric Climate Assemblies at the local level (Sandover, Moseley and Devine-Wright, 2021)."

Experiences of co-production of sanitation services show how co-production may improve outcomes, while at the same time opening up avenues for grassroots organisations to claim political influence (McGranahan and Mitlin, 2016). Co-production may change institutions in response to external interventions (Das, 2016). Although there are drawbacks in terms of the extent to which co-production can be used to legitimise unfair interventions within a given context, co-production may also be a tool for improving the accountability of dominant groups to vulnerable sectors of the population (Nastiti  et al., 2017). There are limitations to co-production. The city of Barcelona, Spain, used co-production methodologies to develop the Barcelona Climate Plan. However, policymakers and civil servants were reluctant to use lay knowledge from participants and political deadlines constrained the time dedicated to deliberation (Satorras  et al., 2020)."

This points to the fundamental requirements of adaptation action in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Slogans such as ‘leave no one behind’ embedded in international policy for cities and settlements recognise the connection between systems of oppression and exclusion that reproduce and perpetuate urban inequality and the delivery of urban services and security (Kabeer, 2016; Stuart and Woodroffe, 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.3.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Intersectional strategies of action seek to consider the multiple forms of structural oppression experienced at the local level (Grunenfelder and Schurr, 2015) and, in the context of adaptation, explain how they produce or exacerbate vulnerabilities. For example, intersectionality ties with the idea of how multiple deprivations shape access to services (from sanitation to health and education) and the exposition to environmental risks (Sicotte, 2014; Lau and Scales, 2016; Van Aelst and Holvoet, 2016; Lievanos and Horne, 2017; Raza, 2017; Yon and Nadimpalli, 2017; European Environment Agency, 2020) (see Box 6.6 on the participation of women in local decision making bodies). For example, fisherwomen in the western coast of India rely on a complex arrangement of relationships around categories of class, caste and gender that shapes their possibilities to draw political resources to maintain their livelihoods and, hence, influence the dynamics of transformation (Thara, 2016). Intersectionality is central to build resilience across communities, rather than in particular areas (Khosla and Masaud, 2010; Reckien  et al., 2017). Including intersectionality deliberately in partnerships with communities can empower socially excluded groups and highlight justice issues while aligning agendas with local development priorities (Castán Broto  et al., 2015a). Despite the high confidence on the growing importance of intersectionality concerns in the delivery of just environmental policies, there is limited evidence of its explicit inclusion in adaptation policies."
wg2_ch06_box-6.6_p1,6.4.3.6 Supports Visionary and Imaginative Design ,"Women are under-represented internationally in governance structures (Prihatini, 2019; Gonzalez-Eiras and Sanz, 2018; Rashkova and Zankina, 2017; Koyuncu and Sumbas). This situation is reflected in urban authorities where participation by those who identify as women is low (Williams, Devika and Aandahl, 2015; Kivoi, 2014). Das (2014) reports deep-rooted economic inequalities are barriers for women’s participation in Indore, India, and that women’s collective empowerment could increase their bargaining power within households as well as in the community and state. Kivoi (2014) draws a similar conclusion presenting experiences from Kenya. The big question is how to make women more visible in the urban governance process?"
wg2_ch06_box-6.6_p2,6.4.3.6 Supports Visionary and Imaginative Design ,"What are the barriers women face and how do we increase their participation so that urban governance become more inclusive? Escalante and Valdivia (2015) show the participatory tools that can be used at different stages of planning for women’s empowerment using bottom-up planning models. Using these tools makes planning processes more inclusive. Araujo and Tejedo-Romero (2016) show from Spanish local councils that women’s political representation in municipalities has a positive influence on the level of transparency, increasing information transparency and reducing information asymmetry. In Myanmar, Minoletti (2014) increased levels of women’s participation in urban authorities helped to improve the quality of governance such as reducing corruption and conflicts, and improving service delivery."
wg2_ch06_box-6.6_p3,6.4.3.6 Supports Visionary and Imaginative Design ,"People traditionally excluded from climate change governance, such as children, are also more likely to have their needs and priorities considered in urban planning for adaptation where there are national advocacy bodies, for example, Commissions for Future, or Children’s commissions (Nordström and Wales, 2019; Watts  et al., 2019; Hayward, 2021). An emphasis on procedural justice in decision-making has potential to produce transformational outcomes where these are defined as significantly reducing inequality (Holland, 2017). In this light, emerging evidence suggests transformative adaptation is more likely to occur if people have the agency to influence decisions and enact change (Archer and Dodman, 2015). Cities are also more likely to build and develop infrastructure that serves the needs of disadvantaged groups when urban climate governance encourages wider community participation and inclusion (Ziervogel, 2019a; Hölscher  et al., 2019; Anguelovski  et al., 2016). This can help to stimulate innovation, shift power relations and address diverse needs (Martel and Sutherland, 2019; Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Experiments in including marginalised groups in adaptation planning are starting to emerge in places such as Quito (Ecuador), Lima (Peru), Manizales (Colombia) and Surat (India), where disadvantaged youth, informal settlers and other vulnerable communities are included in discussions of short-/long-term adaptation needs and fair distribution of adaptation resources (Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016; Sara, Pfeffer and Baud, 2017; Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2014). These processes can also support citizens to manage risks as they encounter them in their everyday life (Ziervogel  et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch06_box-6.6_p4,6.4.3.6 Supports Visionary and Imaginative Design ,"To respond to urban injustices, attention needs to be paid to both the local level and to broader system-wide governance issues (that are unpacked further in Section 6.4). At the local level, it is important to understand who is most vulnerable to climate risk, which is likely to be related to class, race, gender, ability and age (Wilby and Keenan, 2012; Ranganathan and Bratman, 2019; Thomas, Cretney and Hayward, 2019). Factors such as age and levels of ability, as well as those pursuing outdoor livelihoods, have a direct link to higher vulnerability to heat stress (Conry  et al., 2015). In least-developed countries, less than 60% of the urban population have access to piped water which impacts on health and well-being, and emphasises the importance of alternative resources for these households (World Health Organization, Nations and Fund, 2017)."

wg2_ch06_box-6.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there has been a growing literature about the role of urban design, creating new opportunities for both incremental and transformative adaptive responses to climate change (medium evidence, high agreement ). For example, some of these creative design approaches compliment and extend regulatory and land use planning approaches such as form-based codes and established certifications such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design–Neighbourhood Design (LEED-ND) (Garde, 2018; Garde and Hoff, 2017) and the USA’s Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES) (Valente, 2014). Emphasis on sufficiency has also influenced urban design, for example, with the mobilisation of ‘doughnut’ economics that emphasise both a social foundation and an environmental ceiling, for example Amsterdam (Raworth, 2017). However, such cases are rare, substantial public investment is often required (high confidence, high agreement ) (see also Section 6.4.7 on finance and insurance). Other approaches underscore innovation and creativity, at the essence of which are context-specific interventions that draw on a compendium of urban design principles such as indeterminacy (to accommodate climate uncertainty), polyvalency and diversity, and harmony with nature (Dhar and Khirfan, 2017). Creative interventions include the daylighting of buried streams to create climate adaptive public realms (Khirfan  et al., 2020; Khirfan, Mohtat and Peck, 2020). For example, the demolition of a major expressway and the restoration of the Cheonggyecheon Stream reorganised downtown Seoul, South Korea, and significantly contributed to climate change adaptation through stormwater management and reducing the urban heat island effect (Kim and Jung, 2019). Biomimicry and ecological infrastructure are design features that governance bodies can use to reshape space and contribute to place making (Santos Nouri and Costa, 2017; Prior  et al., 2018). For example, urban metabolism and local ecological knowledge has constituted the essence of urban design interventions on the Island of Tobago in ways that capitalise on the contiguous relationship between ecosystems (e.g., the mangrove forest) and human actions (rainwater harvesting and grey water management) (Khirfan and Zhang, 2016). While lack of funding or design capacity, restrictive planning regulations, inequality and competing urban agendas can create barriers for the implementation of creative design solutions. Transition architecture movements are also driving local urban adaptation experiments and exploring ways local learning can be scaled up (Tubridy, 2020; Irwin, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"In delivering adaptation in cities, settlements and infrastructure, however, there is a need to understand and measure the adaptive capacity and limits to manage future risks in communities, institutions and organisations (Filho  et al., 2019). However efforts to track urban adaptation lack consistent methods, metrics and data gathering (Olazabal  et al., 2019b). The scale of complex, cascading challenges, limited finance and governance capacity, combined with the impacts of growing social inequality and sustainable development priorities can result in both soft and hard limits on cities government’s capacity to adapt to climate change (Chanza, 2018; Sanchez Rodriguez, Ürge-Vorsatz and Barau, 2018; Lehmann  et al., 2015; Di Giulio  et al., 2018). Hard limits to adaptation are identified when it is unfeasible to avoid severe risks, while soft limits exist when technological and socioeconomic options are not immediately deployable (IPCC, 2014). In urban contexts, soft limits may become hard limits when large numbers of people are unable to avoid severe climate-related risks of loss and damage (Mechler  et al., 2020). Climate change-related loss and damage that are intangible also require more caution in assessment processes (Roberts and Pelling, 2018; Andrei  et al., 2015; Barnett  et al., 2016; Thomas and Benjamin, 2018). Incorporating Indigenous knowledge can identify people-oriented and place-specific scenarios, leading to development of urban adaptation policies that foster identity, dignity, self-determination and better collective decision making/capacity to act (McShane, 2017; Preston, 2017), and are also sensitive to the local context and limits of community adaptation (Makondo and Thomas, 2018)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Urban transformations represent forms of adaptation that challenge the principles in which a society is established (Pelling, O’Brien and Matyas, 2015) and can be deployed to go beyond the existing limits of development justice and climate change adaptation capacity. While not all adaptation will be transformative, transformative capacities support both ongoing adaptation efforts and the broader systemic change processes that align adaptation efforts with decarbonisation requirements and the delivery of SDGs. ‘Urban transformative capacity’ focuses on understanding what elements of a system to respond to external changing conditions in a manner that transforms the system toward a more sustainable state (Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016). The capacities required to deliver adaptation action in cities and settlements are ‘transformative capacities’, because they move away from thinking of adaptation as an adjustment to a changing external environment to think instead of it as a reconfiguration of infrastructures and institutions to build resilience in the surrounding environment (Pelling, 2010; Matyas and Pelling, 2015). Reflective and iterative learning is integral to fostering transformative capacity (c.f. Luederitz  et al., 2017). Transformative capacity extends across multiple agency levels or geographical locations, as well as various domains (Wilson  et al., 2013; Olsson, Bodin and Folke, 2010; Keeler  et al., 2019b). The components of transformative capacity in cities and settlements can be grouped into three categories (see Table 6.9): (1) agency and forms of interaction, (2) development processes and (3) relational dimensions (Wolfram, 2016). Alongside different forms of technical expertise, there is a need to broaden the interventions of disadvantaged populations in urban sustainability (Wolfram, Borgström and Farrelly, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Table 6.9 presents a defined framework of ideas that local institutions, mostly local governments, can put into practice to improve their adaptive capacity. Enabling transformative capacity requires novel governance arrangements based on broad participation, a diversity of actor networks, socially embedded leadership and empowerment of communities, alongside an understanding of the system dynamics, which refers to system awareness, collective visions, practical experimentation, reflexivity, capacity building, institutional mainstreaming and the multiple levels of agency or scales (Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016; Ziervogel, 2019a; Wolfram, 2019; Hölscher and Frantzeskaki, 2020; Castán Broto  et al., 2018). Many of the transformative capacity components are already visible in local adaptation actions, but many efforts emphasise one element at the expense of others without delivering a systemic perspective. In particular, measures to facilitate the empowerment of communities, reflexivity and social learning are rare but often point toward heightened capacities for transformative, alongside incremental, adaptation (Castán Broto  et al., 2018). Transformative capacity frameworks may foster inclusive governance to deliver risk management that works for the poor in countries such as South Africa (Ziervogel, 2019a)."

wg2_ch06_6.4.5_p3,6.4.5.1 Urban Adaptation Financing Gap ,"The funding required to deliver climate change adaptation will depend on choices made about climate mitigation (IPCC, 2018). Still, the cost of adapting to a global temperature increase of 1.5°C will be a fraction of the cost of adapting to a global temperature increase exceeding 3oC (IPCC, 2019a; IPCC, 2019b; Hoegh-Guldberg  et al., 2018). It will also depend on selected adaptation options, as they have different capital requirements, operating costs and returns on investment (See 6.3). Finally, costs depend on financing sources and mechanisms selected."
wg2_ch06_6.4.5_p4,6.4.5.1 Urban Adaptation Financing Gap ,"Broadly, there are two options for adaptation investment: funding, direct expenditure in preparation for or response to climate change impacts, and financing, the deployment of market-based instruments to attract third-party resources to an adaptation action (Keenan, 2018; Banhalmi-Zakar  et al., 2016). Using funding can be a lower-cost strategy, as there is no third party expecting a return on investment. However, using financing can expand the total resources available for adaptation (White and Wahba, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.5_p5,6.4.5.1 Urban Adaptation Financing Gap ,"The choice of funding and financing mechanism is often based on implicit economic world views (Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019) or on the technical support available to sub-national governments, such as preparing municipal bonds or contracting for public–private partnerships (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018). The urban finance literature has long called for critical interrogation of these choices, as adaptation finance has profound justice implications (Khan  et al., 2020). However, the literature on adaptation investments is limited (Harman, Taylor and Lane, 2015; Keenan, Chu and Peterson, 2019). The use of municipal debt such as green bonds, for example, intensify the financial and environmental risks borne primarily by the poor, the working class or people discriminated against because of race, sexual orientation or ability (Bigger and Millington, 2019)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.5_p6,6.4.5.1 Urban Adaptation Financing Gap ,"The climate imperative has not yet fundamentally changed urban infrastructure investment (White and Wahba, 2019). Mobilising adaptation investment in urban areas continues to depend on strengthening public finance capacities (particularly evaluating and integrating climate risk into economic decisions) and meeting private investors and lenders’ expectations. Climate change creates new investment risks and physical risks (Martimort and Straub, 2016), and highlights the limitations of current models to account for risk and uncertainty when pricing investments (Keenan, 2018). Private investors and lenders do not seem ready to provide adaptation finance on significantly easier or cheaper terms than conventional finance (White and Wahba, 2019). However, a variety of means for financing climate change adaptation in urban areas exist (Table 6.10)."

wg2_ch06_6.4.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,Cities and settlements in higher-income countries typically have access to funding that could be used to enhance resilience and build adaptive capacity; this includes both the private resources of individual households and firms (which varies significantly within and among cities) and public budgets of different government tiers (see Table 6.10).
wg2_ch06_6.4.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Depending on fiscal devolution levels within a country, public revenues may be collected and managed primarily at the national, state, metropolitan or local level. In federal countries, sub-national governments collect an average of 49.4% of public revenues, compared with only 20.7% in unitary countries (OECD/UCLG, 2019). For example, sub-national revenues represent over a quarter of total public revenues in Belgium, Canada and Denmark, but less than 5% in Greece, Ireland and New Zealand (OECD/UCLG, 2019). The share of the national revenue transferred to sub-national governments also varies significantly among countries: grants and subsidies account for over three-quarters of sub-national government revenue in Malta, but less than a quarter of sub-national revenue in Iceland (OECD/UCLG, 2019). A local government’s capacity to collect revenues is further mediated by incomes within a city (which dictates the prospective tax base) and the capacity of civil servants to administer taxes, fees and charges. The result is that metropolitan and local governments’ budgets vary dramatically, across and within countries. For example, per capita municipal budgets vary from USD 1114 in Saskatoon and USD 2682 in Peterborough (Canada), USD 2635 in Leipzig and USD 3638 in Freiburg (Germany), to USD 4907 in Bristol and USD 5612 in Aberdeen (UK) (Löffler, 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Revenue streams are often insufficient relative to the scale of adaptation requirements. For example, Kano, Nigeria, is a large urban area that urgently needs investment in human development and climate resilience but where a fragmented local government has little capacity to finance their climate plans (Mohammed, Hassan and Badamasi, 2019). Many local governments are unable to mobilise funds for adaptation as they face competing priorities, meaning that resources for resilience must be allocated by higher levels of government (Hughes, 2015), which also perceive opportunity costs to adaptation investments. Funding from non-state actors is, therefore, proving important. For example, in the USA, private foundations and non-profit organisations account for 17% and 16%, respectively, of adaptation support in urban areas (Carmin, Nadkarni and Rhie, 2012). However, tapping into these funding sources raises complex questions about accountability and ownership of urban adaptation (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018).

However, the commercial feasibility of private sector insurance depends on more robust estimates of current and future risks, and premiums commensurate with the ability and willingness of consumers to pay.

Land-value capture refers to communities’ ability to capture the benefit of increased land values that result from public investment or other government actions (Germán and Bernstein, 2020).

The construction and infrastructure industries are repeatedly identified as sources of corruption (GIACC, 2020; Chan and Owusu, 2017; Sanderson  et al., 2021).

Post-disaster response and reconstruction, and periods of surge funding following international or national policy priorities are especially vulnerable to corruption, with increased funding and pressure to lower norms of financial management (Imperiale and Vanclay, 2021). Mixed delivery mechanisms have been shown to reduce corruption, for example where civil society organisations are involved in project approval stages, although there is also a risk that civil society organisations will themselves become entangled in corruption.

wg2_ch06_6.4.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,Cities and settlements in higher-income countries typically have access to funding that could be used to enhance resilience and build adaptive capacity; this includes both the private resources of individual households and firms (which varies significantly within and among cities) and public budgets of different government tiers (see Table 6.10).
wg2_ch06_6.4.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Depending on fiscal devolution levels within a country, public revenues may be collected and managed primarily at the national, state, metropolitan or local level. In federal countries, sub-national governments collect an average of 49.4% of public revenues, compared with only 20.7% in unitary countries (OECD/UCLG, 2019). For example, sub-national revenues represent over a quarter of total public revenues in Belgium, Canada and Denmark, but less than 5% in Greece, Ireland and New Zealand (OECD/UCLG, 2019). The share of the national revenue transferred to sub-national governments also varies significantly among countries: grants and subsidies account for over three-quarters of sub-national government revenue in Malta, but less than a quarter of sub-national revenue in Iceland (OECD/UCLG, 2019). A local government’s capacity to collect revenues is further mediated by incomes within a city (which dictates the prospective tax base) and the capacity of civil servants to administer taxes, fees and charges. The result is that metropolitan and local governments’ budgets vary dramatically, across and within countries. For example, per capita municipal budgets vary from USD 1114 in Saskatoon and USD 2682 in Peterborough (Canada), USD 2635 in Leipzig and USD 3638 in Freiburg (Germany), to USD 4907 in Bristol and USD 5612 in Aberdeen (UK) (Löffler, 2016)."

Many local governments are unable to mobilise funds for adaptation as they face competing priorities, meaning that resources for resilience must be allocated by higher levels of government (Hughes, 2015), which also perceive opportunity costs to adaptation investments. Funding from non-state actors is, therefore, proving important. For example, in the USA, private foundations and non-profit organisations account for 17% and 16%, respectively, of adaptation support in urban areas (Carmin, Nadkarni and Rhie, 2012). However, tapping into these funding sources raises complex questions about accountability and ownership of urban adaptation (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018).

Africa faces an estimated 40% infrastructure financing gap, but this gap is almost certainly higher in the continent’s rapidly growing cities (Baker and McKenzie, 2015). Relative poverty, weak or absent local fiscal systems, and contested tenure that prevents land being used as collateral, have restricted investment in African cities (Berrisford, Cirolia and Palmer, 2018; Dodman  et al., 2017). Sub-Saharan African countries are reaching the 40% urban threshold at national per capita incomes of around USD 1000 per annum, significantly poorer than South-East Asian and Latin American cities at the same level of urbanisation (Freire, Lall and Leipziger, 2014). Absolute poverty, in conjunction with weak revenue collection and low levels of investment, render conventional infrastructure finance difficult (Smolka, 2013; Global Commission on Economy and Climate, 2017; Berrisford, Cirolia and Palmer, 2018; Cirolia and Mizes, 2019).

Mining and the extraction and processing of fossil fuels accounted for almost a third of greenfield FDI in Africa in 2018 (UNCTAD, 2019). The FDI secured by cities has tended to serve an urban elite and has been used to build shopping malls, housing settlements and airlines (Watson, 2015). It is also unevenly distributed across the continent and within cities. Five countries; Egypt, South Africa, Congo, Morocco and Ethiopia, accounted for more than half the total FDI in 2018 (UNCTAD, 2019), leaving large parts of Africa’s growing cities described by financiers as ‘high risk’ and their citizens deemed ‘unbankable’ (UCLG, 2016)."

Monitoring and evaluation systems in urban areas will necessarily be incremental and additive, and will have to build on existing indicator systems (Solecki and Rosenzweig, 2020). There is a need to develop practical and efficient frameworks to assess adaptation progress across all levels of public and private decision making.

Klostermann et al. (2018) emphasise the importance of learning through iterative cycles of selection of monitoring objectives, procedures, data collection and evaluation, and inputs to adaptation policy and planning processes (see also discussion of evaluation and learning in Section 17.5.1.7).

wg2_ch06_6.4.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report acknowledged the lack of standard metrics to measure and monitor success in urban adaptation and suggested a list of indicators that could be developed, while also taking note of the localised nature of adaptation (see also (Rufat  et al., 2015)). However, predominant approaches are typically not conducted at the appropriate scale to inform adaptation decision-making (Ford  et al., 2018). While some scholars advocate the use of a unifying indicator of social vulnerability (Spielman  et al., 2020), others propose to develop flexible sets of comparable indicators that can be adjusted to different contexts (Leiter  et al., 2019). Risk-based approaches are seen as an alternative in a context where the monitoring of decision-relevant variables in urban climate adaptation planning is essential to link climatic risk assessment and action (Hallegatte and Engle, 2019; Kingsborough, Borgomeo and Hall, 2016; McDermott and Surminski, 2018). Because of the need to define normative frameworks for risk evaluation, what is acceptable, for what purpose and for how long (Galarraga  et al., 2018), these approaches may offer an opportunity for the generation of a shared understanding on goals and limitations of adaptation (McDermott and Surminski, 2018). However, risk-based indicators may also create a bias toward quantifiable variables that tend to be based on climatic modelling outputs, engineering or financial assessments. Based on this and various examples of urban development projects, Hallegatte and Engle (2019) claim it is important to consider output-based indicators and process-based indicators that talk about government, voice and empowerment. Overall, dozens of indicator-based approaches to assess climate adaptation have been proposed across the scientific and policy literature, especially in the broader framework of (community) resilience assessment tools (Sharifi, 2016; Feldmeyer  et al., 2019), and in different sectors, for example the climate benefits of NBS (Kabisch  et al., 2016; Donatti  et al., 2020). Although these efforts may help to mainstream the evaluation of adaptation in current city evaluation initiatives, the development of comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems is lacking."

Cities worldwide face important social, environmental and economic conflicts related to resource inequality, poverty, environmental pollution and social tensions that coexist with climatic risks. It makes sense to integrate climate change adaptation assessment goals and needs into existing frameworks for the sake of efficiency. This will benefit small urban areas and cities in developing regions that often face data scarcity and may also find available indicators irrelevant to their realities and, thus, be required to adjust them (Simon  et al., 2016). Efforts to coordinate frameworks for the assessment of sustainability (e.g., Local Agenda, sustainability appraisals), resilience (e.g., 100 Resilient Cities, new standards for urban resilience), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting (e.g., Global Covenant of Mayors for Energy and Climate) can be deployed to learn about contexts. However, they need to be applied with caution as enforcing external requirements may lead to local tensions during their application (for example Roberts  et al., 2020). In a context where adaptation efforts need to be aggregated and evaluated across nations (Magnan, 2016) and their implications on wider objectives such as sustainable development and social justice need to be assessed (Long and Rice, 2019), urban adaptation monitoring and evaluation can inform national and international processes that enable a global stocktake of adaptation."

There is no one single transformative solution or approach relevant in every case (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018; Shi, 2019; Goh, 2019).

Transformation engages with critiques of adaptation or risk reduction as an individual responsibility (Sou, 2018). The idea is to use transformation to focus on coordinating collective efforts (Haque et al, 2014). The coordination of multiple actors is a condition to enable transformative institutions (Torabi et al, 2018) and link adaptation action to development efforts (Chu et al, 2017; Roberts and O’Donoghue, 2013). The role of communities and citizens in such an approach to transformation is ambiguous. Sometimes communities and citizens are presented as critical agents of transformation (Limthongsakul et al, 2017). Other times, however, they are simply situated within strong and durable networks that provide the institutional setting to build resilience (Danière  et al., 2016). Despite the political nature of transformative approaches and the evidence that transformative approaches rely on protest and political activism, few authors recognise this strategy (but see Bahadur and Tanner, 2014; Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017; Dierwechter and Wessells, 2013)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Transformation is also more than a single instance of institutional change. Historical perspectives on transformation enable an understanding of the chain of institutional changes that ultimately lead to significant or far-reaching reconfiguration of infrastructure and service provision (Rojas et al, 2015). Paradigm changes, such as new engagements with nature and green infrastructure, will improve adaptation outcomes (Roberts  et al., 2012). Changes of paradigms, however, are not inherently positive and may clash with existing interests or involve trade-offs with other priorities. When care is taken to ensure greater inclusion in urban decision-making, disadvantaged, vulnerable communities are less likely to be disadvantaged. For example, indigenous traditions of nature management provide entry points for the sustainable management of resources, such as seed banks, urban agriculture and the local management of watersheds and floods, may be at odds with conventional structures of expert knowledge (Cid-Aguayo, 2016; Chandra and Gaganis, 2016). These traditions are vital both because of the solution space that they open in the local context and how they serve to create resilience through collective and intergenerational learning (Chandra and Gaganis, 2016)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.7_p4,NO_TITLE,"While aspects of transformative capacity identified in the literature may facilitate far-reaching change, there is limited evidence of actual transformations as an outcome of adaptation. While community led resilience agendas may tackle poverty related issues, they struggle to tackle city-wide structural forms of inequality (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Processes of shared learning and co-production of knowledge can reinforce existing power dynamics and be limited by technical framings of vulnerability that marginalise political issues (Orleans Reed  et al., 2013). These issues are especially acute in relation to land use decisions where short-term fiscal and commercial interests conflict with long-term vulnerability reduction objectives (Brown, Dayal and Rumbaitis Del Rio, 2012). It can be difficult for adaptation actions to target cities’ underlying political–economic structure, such as entrenched political–economic interests, elite influence over decision making or neoliberal planning logics that maintain and reproduce inequality (Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017). Urban resilience plans may be formulated in disconnection from broader development strategies, which leads to a limited ability to tackle underlying structures of political power and urban development practices (Weinstein et al., 2019). Evidence from Kolkata demonstrates the limitations of resilience plans to address underlying conditions of vulnerability, including the commodification of hazardous land, under-provision of informal settlements and spatial segregation of the urban poor (Rumbach, 2017)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.7_p5,NO_TITLE,"Planning for transformative adaptation is more likely  where communities can learn collectively (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Restemeyer, van den Brink and Woltjer, 2017; Kabisch  et al., 2017; Fraser  et al., 2017; Putri, Dalimunthe and Prasojo). Greater citizen engagement facilitates implementing specific measures for radical policymaking or the mainstreaming of environmental knowledge into adaptation practices (Reed et al, 2015). Do it yourself (DIY) planning, in which stakeholders focus on creating and improving specific urban spaces they inhabit, has led to urban greening experiments led by civil society that change paradigms of urban and environmental management (Cloutier, Papin and Bizier, 2018). Social learning may occur through combinations of activism and collaboration with and between informal settlement dwellers, as shown in adaptation experiences in informal settlements in Hanoi and Bangkok (Danière  et al., 2016).. The adaptation process can benefit from the inclusion of multiple sources of knowledge for social learning, including universities but also communities and citizens (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Citizens assemblies are increasingly recognised as spaces for transformative adaptation (Muradova, Walker and Colli, 2020), although their potential influence at different government levels is still not fully understood."
wg2_ch06_6.4.7_p6,NO_TITLE,"The integration of multiple forms of knowledge leads to social learning (medium evidence, high agreement ). Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge can provide essential insights into community needs and experiences of housing and urban infrastructure to inform climate adaptation, including improper waste disposal, inadequate drainage and poor sanitation, but there is significant variation in community knowledge networks (Roy  et al., 2018b; Douglas et al, 2018; Waters and Adger, 2017). It is important to identify and address barriers to the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, such as the dominance of scientific knowledge, oppression and/or racism, and fragmentation of knowledge including gender and generational divides (see Burke and Heynen, 2014; Whyte, 2017; Victor, 2015; Lövbrand  et al., 2015; Kelly, 2019).The incorporation of Indigenous knowledge in urban decision making requires a constructive dialogue with scientists and urban planners."
wg2_ch06_6.4.7_p7,NO_TITLE,"Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge have an important role to play in urban planning and management. They can support impact detection and evaluation in urban areas (Codjoe et al, 2014), weather forecasting in urban areas (Magee  et al., 2016; Ebhuoma and Simatele, 2019), climate change adaptation in urban agriculture (Wahab and Popoola, 2018; Solomon  et al., 2016), urban food security (Simatele and Simatele, 2015), planning and managing urban solid waste (Kosoe et al, 2019), urban flood management (Thorn et al, 2015; Jameson and Baud, 2016; Hooli, 2016), drought perception and coping strategies (Saboohi  et al., 2019), and ecological restoration and urban commons management (Nagendra, 2016; Nagendra and Mundoli, 2019). They can help define baselines for past climate and ecological change, providing a historical perspective on changes in urban commons such as lakes and trees (Nagendra, 2016), as well as past climatic changes or climate baselines (Ajayi and Mafongoya, 2017) and shifting baseline syndrome (Fernández-Llamazares  et al., 2015; Soga and Gaston, 2018; see Businger  et al., 2018 for a review of hurricane history in Hawaiian newspapers; also Wickman, 2018). Incorporating Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge can help generate more people-oriented and place-specific approaches, leading to adaptation policies that foster identity, dignity, self-determination and better collective decision making and capacity to act (Preston, 2017; McShane, 2017) (see also Section 6.1)."
wg2_ch06_6.4.7_p8,NO_TITLE,"Envisioning development alternatives through adaptation as a first step toward transformative adaptation can leverage social learning. Experiences of migration, length of residence and the density of local social-networks impact social learning opportunities and underscore why context-specific social education is vital (Waters and Adger, 2017; Karunarathne and Lee, 2020). Learning across and between communities can be enhanced when care is taken to understand local challenges. Given power relationships, cultural needs and community aspirations, a top-down approach to information sharing is generally less effective than community partnerships and co-created knowledge at surfacing visions and strategies for getting past baked-in, unequal and unsustainable development assumptions and practices (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Clemens  et al., 2016; Thi Hong Phuong, Biesbroek and Wals, 2017; Fitzgerald and Lenhart, 2016; Fisher and Dodman, 2019). Social learning in formal and informal urban contexts is also enhanced when care is taken to ensure multiple stakeholders have opportunities to understand a variety of viewpoints, values, resources and ideals, and that these viewpoints are clearly identified in decision-making (Thi Hong Phuong, Biesbroek and Wals, 2017). However much social learning still happens only after a crisis, for example in urban water adaptation, and new knowledge is often frustrated by the lock in of powerful local institutions and groups (Johannessen  et al., 2019). Social learning is, however, only one component of the development of climate-resilient pathways. System perspectives theorise the possibility of tipping points, leverage points or disruptive technologies to challenge the stable regime to create a broader reconfiguration (Chapter 17; O’Neill  et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The world is urban. Billions of people live in towns and cities. Hardly anyone, even in remote rural locations, is separated from the flows of trade that connect the world and are held together by networks of transport and communication infrastructure systems. Connected networks once broken can cascade out, multiplying impacts across urban and rural areas. When major manufacturing centres or regionally important ports are impacted, global trade suffers. For example, flooding in Bangkok in 2011 led to a global shortage in semiconductors and a slowdown in global computer manufacturing."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Despite cities generating wealth, additional vulnerability to climate change is being created in urban areas every day. Demographic change, social and economic pressures, and governance failures that drive inequality and marginality mean that increasing numbers of people who live in towns and cities are exposed to flooding, temperature extremes and water or food insecurity. This leads to an adaptation gap, where rich neighbourhoods can afford strategies to reduce vulnerability while poorer communities are unable to do the same. Although this would be so even without a changing climate, climate change increases the variability and extremes of weather, exposing more people, businesses and buildings to floods and other events. The combination of rising vulnerability and increasing exposure translates to a growth in the number of people and properties at risk from climate change in cities worldwide."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Around the world, vulnerability is rising but differs considerably between and within urban areas. Settlements of up to 1 million people are the most rapidly expanding and also among the most vulnerable. These settlements often have limited community level organisation and might not have a dedicated local government. Coping with rapid population growth under conditions of climate change and constrained capacity is a major challenge. For large cities, multiple local governments and well-organised community-based organisations interact with large businesses and national political parties in a complicated cocktail of interests that can interfere with planning and action to reduce vulnerability."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"For the poorest living in urban slums, informal settlements or renting across the city, lack of secure tenure and inadequate access to basic services compound vulnerability. But even the wealthy in large cities are not fully protected from climate change-related shocks. Just like breaks in infrastructure between towns and rural settlements, big city infrastructure can be broken by even local landslides, floods or temperature events, with consequences cascading across the city. Electricity blackouts are the most common and can affect water pumping, traffic regulation and streetlights, as well as hospitals, schools and homes. Still, it is the urban poor and marginalised who experience the greatest exposure, most vulnerability and least capacity to cope."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Rounds of exposure and impact can reduce the capacity of survivors to cope with future events. As a result, the already vulnerable and exposed become more vulnerable over time, increasing urban inequalities. But this need not be the case. Focussing on vulnerability reduction is not easy, it requires joined-up action across social and economic development sectors, together with critical infrastructure planning. It often also means partnering local government with informal and community-based actors. But there is considerable experience globally on what works and how to deliver reduced vulnerability for the urban poor and for cities as a whole. The challenge is to scale up this experience and accelerate its application to keep pace with climate change and address the adaptation gap."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Cities and settlements are constantly changing. Their populations grow and shrink, economic activities expand or decline, and political priorities shift. The risks that cities and their residents face are influenced by both urban change and climate change. The seriousness of these risks into the 21st Century will be shaped by the interactions between drivers of change including population growth, economic development and land use change."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"In a warming world, increasing air temperature makes the urban heat island effect in cities worse. One key risk is heatwaves in cities that are likely  to affect half of the future global urban population, with negative impacts on human health and economic productivity. Heat and built infrastructure such as streets and houses interact with each other and magnify risks in cities. For instance, higher urban temperatures can cause infrastructure to overheat and fail, as well as increase the concentration of harmful air pollutants such as ozone."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The density of roads and buildings in urban areas increases the area of impermeable surfaces, which interact with more frequent heavy precipitation events to increase the risk of urban flooding. This risk of flooding is greater for coastal settlements due to sea level rise and storm surges from tropical cyclones. Coastal inundation in the Miami-Dade region in Florida, USA, is estimated to have caused over USD 465 million in lost real estate value between 2005 and 2016, and it is likely  that coastal flood risks in the region beyond 2050 will increase without adaptation to climate change."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Within cities, different groups of people can face different risks. Many low-income residents live in informal settlements alongside coasts or rivers, which greatly heightens exposure and vulnerability to climate-driven hazards. In urban areas in Ghana, for example, risks from urban flooding can compound health risks, and have resulted in outbreaks of malaria, typhoid and cholera. Those outbreaks have been shown to disproportionately affect poorer communities."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Severe risks in cities and settlements also arise from reduced water availability. As urban areas grow, the amount of water required to meet basic needs of people and industries increases. When increased demand is combined with water scarcity from lower rainfall due to climate change, water resource management becomes a critical issue. Low-income groups already face major challenges in accessing water, and the situation is likely  to worsen due to growing conflicts over scarce resources, increasing water prices and diminishing infrastructure provisions in ever-expanding informal settlements."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"These key risks already differ greatly between cities, and between different groups of people in the same city. By 2050, these discrepancies are likely to be even more apparent. Cities with limited financial resources, regulatory authority and technical capacities are less equipped to respond to climate change. People who already have fewer resources and constrained opportunities face higher levels of risk because of their vulnerability. As a result of this, key risks vary not only over time as climate change is felt more strongly, but also over space, between cities exposed to different hazards and with different abilities to adapt, and between social groups, meaning between people who are more or less affected and able to cope."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Settlements bring together people, buildings, economic activities and infrastructure services, and thus integrated, cross-sector, adaptation actions offer the best way to build resilience to climate change impacts. For example, actions to manage flood risk include installing flood proofing measures within and outside properties, improving capacity of urban drainage along roads, incorporating nature-based solutions (NbS) within the urban areas, constructing flood defences and managing land upstream of settlements to reduce runoff."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation actions will be more effective if they are implemented in partnership with local communities, national governments, research institutions, and the private and third sector. Climate action should not be considered as an additional or side action to other activities. Rather, climate action should be mainstreamed into existing processes, including those that contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (2015) and New Urban Agenda adopted at the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in 2016. Cities are already coming together through international networks to share good practice about adaptation actions, speeding up the dissemination of knowledge."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"This integrated approach to adaptation in human settlements needs to be supported by various other actions, including potential co-benefits with carbon emissions reductions, public health and ecosystem conservation goals. First, information on climate risks needs to be embedded into the architectural design, delivery and retrofitting of housing, transportation, spatial planning and infrastructure across neighbourhood and city scales. This includes making information on climate impacts widely available, updating design standards and strengthening regulation to avoid development in high-risk locations. Second, the capacity of communities needs to be strengthened, especially among those in informal settlements, the poorest and other vulnerable groups including minorities, migrants, women, children, elderly, disabled and people with serious health conditions such as obesity. This involves raising awareness, incorporating communities into adaptation processes, and strengthening regulation, policies and provision of infrastructure services. Third, nature-based solutions should be integrated to work alongside traditional ‘grey’ or engineered infrastructure. Vegetation corridors, greenspace, wetlands and other green infrastructure can be woven into the built environment to reduce heat and flood risks, whilst providing other benefits such as health and biodiversity."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Although even the largest city covers only a small area of the planet, all settlements are part of larger catchments from which people, water, food, energy, materials and other resources support them. Actions within cities should be mindful of wider impacts and avoid displacing issues elsewhere."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Urbanisation is a global trend which is interacting with climate change to create complex risks in cities and settlements, especially for those that already have high levels of poverty, unemployment, housing informality and backlogs of services. Many cities and settlements are seeing increasing action to manage climate risks. On top of reducing communities’ exposure to climate risk, adaptation actions can have benefits for reducing urban poverty and enhancing economic performance in ways that reduce inequality and advance sustainability goals. Adaptation actions, however, can also have unintended consequences. That is why care needs to be taken to ensure climate adaptation planning and development of new infrastructure does not exacerbate inequality or negatively impact other sustainable development priorities. Climate adaptation planning is most effective when it is sensitive to the diverse ways that low-income and minority communities are more likely  to experience climate risk, including women, children, migrants, refugees, internally displaced peoples and racial/ethnic minority groups, among others."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Adapting to climate change can have benefits for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and urban inequalities. In cities where growing numbers of people live in informal settlements, introducing risk-reducing physical infrastructure such as piped water, sanitation and drainage systems can enhance the quality of life of the community. At the same time, those measures can increase health outcomes and reduce urban inequalities by reducing exposure to flooding or heat impacts. In less developed countries, less than 60% of the urban population have access to piped water which, in turn, impacts their health and well-being. Increasingly, housing is being built better to manage heat risk through insulation or changing building orientation, or to flood risk by raising structures, which then contributes to well-being and ability to work. Improvements to early warning systems can help people evacuate rapidly in case of storm surges or flooding. Although the most vulnerable often do not get these warnings in time."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Carefully planned nature-based solutions (NbS), such as public green space, improved urban drainage systems and storm water management, can deliver both health and development benefits. When these adaptation actions succeed, water, waste and sanitation can be improved to better manage climate risk and provide households and cities with better services. Many nature-based solutions entail bringing back plants and trees into cities, which also helps to reduce the concentration of heat-trapping GHGs in the atmosphere."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"When care is taken to ensure that adaptation responses are equitable, and that a range of voices are heard in planning, the needs of the disadvantaged are more likely to be addressed. For example, a study that looked at transport plans across 40 cities in Portugal saw that some urban communities have prioritised the needs of disadvantaged users such as the elderly and disabled, while at the same time reducing urban transport emissions and enhancing public well-being and equity of transport. On the other hand, in some cities, there is evidence of emerging trade-offs associated with climate adaptation actions where sea walls and temporary flood barriers were erected in economically valuable areas and not is less well-off areas. Going forward, it is important to ensure that vulnerable groups’ needs are carefully considered, both in terms of climate and other risks, as this has not been sufficiently done in the past."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure that climate adaptation efforts have positive results and include the concerns of everyone affected. Cities and local communities are diverse, and thus they have diverse perspectives on what responses to prioritise. Moreover, adaptation efforts may impact people’s lives in very different ways. Policy tools, strategies and financial arrangements for adaptation can include all society sectors and address socioeconomic inequalities. Planning and decision making must respond to marginalised voices and future generations (including children and youth)."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Efforts to adapt to climate change can be incremental, reformist or transformational, depending on the scale of the change required. Incremental action may address specific climate impacts in a given place, but do not challenge the social and political institutions that prevent people from bouncing back better. Reformist action may address some of the social and institutional drivers of exposure and vulnerability, but without addressing the underlying socioeconomic structures that drive differential forms of exposure. For example, social protection measures may improve people’s capacity to cope with climate impacts, but that improved capacity will depend on maintaining such protection measures. Transformative action involves fundamental changes in political and socioeconomic systems, oriented toward addressing vulnerability drivers (e.g., socioeconomic inequalities, consumption cultures). All forms of adaptation are relevant to deliver resilient futures because of the variability of conditions in which adaptation action is needed."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Local and regional governments play an essential role in delivering planning and institutional action suited to local conditions in cities and settlements. Potential strategies can span multiple sectors and scales, ranging from land use management, building codes, critical infrastructure designs and community development actions, to different legal, financial, participatory decision making and robust monitoring and evaluation arrangements. NGOs or third sector organisations can also play a coordinating role by building dialogues across governments, the private sectors and communities through effective communication and social learning. Local action tends to falter without the support of national governments as they are often facilitators of resources and finance. They can create institutional frameworks that facilitate (rather than impede) local action. National governments also play a crucial role in the development of large-scale infrastructures."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Private actors can also drive adaptation action. The evaluation of private-led infrastructure and housing projects suggests that the prioritisation of profit, however, may have a detrimental impact on the overall resilience of a place. New institutional models such as public–private partnerships respond to the shortcomings of both the public and private sectors. Still, the evidence of them facilitating the inclusion of multiple actors is mixed."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"The private sector can mobilise finance. However, the forms of finance available for adaptation are limited and directed to huge projects that do not always address local adaptation needs. Private actors tend to join adaptation projects when there is an expectation of large profits, such as in interventions that increase real estate value. Private-led adaptation can lead to ‘gentrification’ whereby low-income populations are relocated from urban centres and safer settlements. Models that enable the collaboration between public, private and civil society sectors have greater potential to mobilise adaptation finance in inclusive ways."
wg2_ch06_FAQ 6.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Forms of collaborative planning and decision making can create dialogues for a sustainable future in cities, settlements and infrastructure systems. Adaptation action needs multiple approaches. For example, adaptation needs both actions that depend on dialogues between multiple actors (e.g., urban planning and zoning) and action that follows strong determination and leadership (e.g., declarations of emergency and target commitments). There are adaptation actions that depend on place-based conditions (e.g., flood defences) and those that require considering interactions across scales (e.g., regulatory frameworks). The growth of adaptation capacities, fostering dialogues, empowered communities, multi-scalar assessments and foresight within current institutions can support effective and inclusive adaptation action that is also sustained in the long term."
