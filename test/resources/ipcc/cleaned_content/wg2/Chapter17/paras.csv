wg2_ch17_17.1.1_p1,17.1.1.1 Decision-Making for Managing Climate Risks in AR6,"Addressing the impacts and risks associated with observed and projected climate change (Chapter 16) is fundamentally and intricately tied to the decision-making options available to manage those risks. Climate risk decision-making focuses on the processes needed to identify and characterise those risks as well as generate plans and policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks (derived from the definition of risk and risk management in Chapter 1). This chapter presents an assessment of the evidence on climate risk decision-making as a set of processes that involve a range of actors in different contexts resulting in diverse outcomes. The climate risk decision makers and their actions are the central focus of the assessment. The chapter is an assessment of the evidence of the decision-making options that are available in practice, and functions as a central pivot point between the identification of key climate risks (Chapter 16) and the means to integrate and leverage action on climate risk decision-making into the broader requirements of climate resilient development pathways (Chapter 18). This section introduces the main entry points on decision-making that have framed this assessment (Sections 17.1.1.1–17.1.1.5), as well as the key terms used to frame this assessment and its organisation in this chapter (Section 17.1.2)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.1_p2,17.1.1.1 Decision-Making for Managing Climate Risks in AR6,"A central framing point is the connection between climate risk decision-making and adaptation. Adaptation for human systems in this report is introduced in Chapter 1 and defined in the Glossary as ‘the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities’. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (see IPCC 6th Assessment Report [AR6] Glossary [Annex II]). In this chapter, we consider adaptations that may be implemented by people, whether they be to support human, managed, or natural systems, and the processes and factors that underpin adaptation in these diverse settings. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished in Chapter 1, including anticipatory versus reactive, autonomous versus planned, and incremental versus transformational (IPCC WGII glossaries; Chapters 16–18). These dichotomies and interactions are assessed here. Implementation of adaptation through iterative risk management decision-making emphasises that anticipating and responding to climate change does not consist of a single set of judgements at a single point in time, but rather an ongoing cycle of assessment, action, reassessment, learn and response (Chapter 1)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Climate Agreement, the UN Sendai Framework Disaster Risk Reduction and the UN Habitat New Urban Agenda, helped push climate risk management and adaptation forward from the global to the national level, from the planning stage into implementation, and provide benchmarks for adaptation progress. To assess adaptation progress (Section 17.5), the interplay between top-down (institutional) and bottom-up (individual/social/community) processes, multi-scale interaction (local, regional, national and international), iterative risk management, differing forms of knowledge, and equity are especially crucial (particularly Sections 17.2, 17.4). Parallel to these advances is an understanding and assessment of appropriate decision support tools, methods and evaluation metrics (Section 17.3)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, significant advances have been made in regard to the understanding of the drivers of decision-making and contexts in which climate risk decision-making takes place. Climate risk decision-making generally, and adaptation specifically, has been a focus within the IPCC special reports in the sixth assessment cycle. An overall goal of climate risk management is to eliminate or reduce the risk to levels that are socio-politically and economically acceptable. Risk management to an acceptable level may not be feasible because of limits or barriers to adaptation. Future potential risks are a more complex matter given the need to define time scales and spatial extent, and uncertainties. In the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (IPCC, 2018a), the risks associated with climate-related impacts were found to be higher under emission scenarios above 1.5°C, raising awareness for the need to limit the impacts of warming through the acceleration of climate mitigation and both incremental and transformational adaptation (IPCC, 2018a)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The AR6 IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (IPCC, 2019b) added the dimensions of pace, intensity and scale of climate impacts and adaptation or mitigation responses and adverse consequences. Relevant land-based adverse consequences include those on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including ecosystem services), ecosystems and species."
wg2_ch17_17.1.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"While a generic understanding of the decision-making process has emerged from the literature, the chapter assesses how these components and their dimensions interact across a range of temporal (short, long term as defined in the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate [SROCC]), scalar (household to global), institutional/governance (formal, informal, bottom-up, top-down) and magnitude (micro adaptation, small scale; macro adaptation, large scale) (Section 17.2). The IPCC SRCCL placed emphasis on acknowledging co-benefits and trade-offs to avoid barriers to implementation, with particular attention to land use decisions. It states that this coordination can be supported by building networks of decision makers across scales and sectors, including local stakeholders from vulnerable groups, and by adopting and implementing policies in a flexible and iterative manner (IPCC, 2019b)."

These works provide foundational assessment of evidence on decision-making systems that connect different spatial and temporal scales and diverse cultural contexts in which climate risk management takes place, the varying interactions of decision makers and their stakeholder groups, and the barriers and enablers to decision-making, including governance, finance and knowledge (Section 17.4)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Another significant advance is that, instead of cataloguing decision-making strategies, the literature has now evolved to the point where adaptation progress, effectiveness and efficiency can be more meaningfully assessed through increased monitoring and evaluation capacity, although the ability to measure success and effectiveness is not fully developed and is hampered by lack of data, agreed methods and terms, and time to fully evaluate adaptation actions (see Sections 17.3.3 and 17.5, Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter). The ambition to describe effectiveness and success illustrates further maturation of the literature on climate risk decision-making as a system process. Overall, the process of climate risk decision-making remains dynamic, and the chapter attempts to assess a variety of proactive management approaches being developed and tested to address adverse, diverse and complex risks in a wide range of developing and developed country contexts (Figure 17.1). The chapter provides a synthesis of how these new approaches are reflected in the sectoral and regional chapters and cross-chapter papers of this report (Chapters 2–15; Cross-Chapter Papers 1–7). Specifically, the goal is to provide a line of sight between the sectoral and regional chapters and cross-chapter papers’ decision-making assessment to sections in this chapter.

wg2_ch17_17.1.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"In AR6 (Chapter 16 and cross-chapter papers), over 100 key risks have been identified across regions and sectors, which have the potential to manifest into severe impacts that are relevant to the interpretation of UNFCCC Article 2, specifically on the objective to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. These risks are likely 2  to become more severe under higher warming scenarios and social-ecological conditions that yield high exposure and vulnerability to the associated climate-related hazards. In this report, these key risks have been grouped into categories represented by eight overarching risks (called Representative Key Risks, RKRs) relating to: (1) coastal socio-ecological systems; (2) terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; (3) critical physical infrastructure, networks and services; (4) living standards; (5) human health; (6) food security; (7) water security; and (8) peace and human mobility (Chapter 16).

This chapter expands the discussion of the contexts for decision-making in a number of ways (Section 17.4), including an examination of informal as well as formal decisions, an attention to emerging actors, particularly social movements, and consideration of several dimensions of governance. It expands the treatment of decision processes, with particular attention to framing and to the integration of multiple time frames (Sections 17.3 and 17.6)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there has been an increasing ambition for adaptation, signalled by growing attention to the adaptation gaps and deficits, which call for extensive and intensive levels of action (Chen et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017; Tompkins et al., 2018; Valente and Veloso-Gomes, 2020; UNEP, 2021a), as well as increased attention to co-benefits between climate risk reduction and other benefits, such as equity and biodiversity conservation (Colloff et al., 2017, Section 17.5.1; Smith et al., 2020). Climate risk decision-making as an object of study has emerged in a more central location within the literature as adaptation moves from planning into the realm of practice. The broad sense of urgency (summarised in Wilson and Orlove, 2019; Wilson and Orlove, 2021) shows growth of the term ‘urgency’ in both scholarly publications and the popular press since 2014, building on earlier increases starting around 2005, and a dramatic spike of the terms ‘climate crisis’ and ‘climate emergency’. Paralleling this call for more extensive and rapid action is the emergence of the term ‘transformational’ adaptation and decision-making. Transformational adaptation (defined and deeply examined in Chapters 1 and 16 and Section 17.2) highlights efforts that involve large-scale, systemic change (Wilson et al., 2020) and involves ‘adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices including approaches that enable new ways of decision-making on adaptation’ (IPCC, 2018a). The complex relationship between incremental adaptation and transformational adaptation is presented and reviewed in Section 17.2. Furthermore, the literature since the AR5 report has moved beyond the question of limits and barriers to adaptation as relevant aspects for decision-making to additionally assessing drivers of change, with increasing focus devoted to more nuanced and differentiated contexts for action."
wg2_ch17_17.1.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"AR5 extensively assessed the conditions of adaptation with a focus on the role of governance, finance, knowledge and capacity. AR6 extends this examination of adaptation and the decision-making process around it by focusing on enablers. Adaptation enablers are defined as those conditions or properties that specifically promote or advance the adaptation process (Chapter 1). Enablers are positively associated with likelihood that adaptation planning occurs, and strategies will be put into practice. Three broad enabling conditions are presented in the chapter (Section 17.4): governance (legislation, regulation, institutions, litigation), finance (needs, sources, intermediaries, instruments flows, equity) and knowledge (capacities, climate services, big data, Indigenous/local knowledge, co-production, boundary organisations). As an extension of enabling conditions, the chapter also examines catalysing conditions for adaptation (Section 17.4.5). Catalysing conditions motivate and accelerate the process of decision-making, leading to more frequent and potentially substantial adaptations. The chapter recognises that the relative influence of enabling conditions and catalysing conditions is set within the human dimensions of climate change including vulnerability, inequality, poverty and the achievement/non-achievement of SDGs (Figure 8.1)."
wg2_ch17_17.1.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The mechanisms and conditions for decision-making provide the basis for the chapter. AR5 provided a detailed chapter on the support of climate decision-making. Chapter 2 of AR5 (Jones et al., 2014) concluded, with high confidence, that risk management provides a useful framework for most climate change decision-making, and that iterative risk management is most suitable in situations characterised by large uncertainties, long time frames, the potential for learning over time, and the influence of both climate as well as other socioeconomic and biophysical changes. Furthermore, decision support is situated at the intersection of data provision, expert knowledge and human decision-making at a range of scales from the individual to the organisation and institution."
wg2_ch17_17.1.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"The climate risk management decision-making process follows a set of general considerations. The detail of each decision is often highly context specific. Climate risk decision-making is bound to the question of how and under what circumstance it is appropriate to alter, reduce or transfer and retain risk. Different types of risk (e.g., gradual compared with catastrophic) and conditions of risk (e.g., known versus uncertain) are associated with different types of responses (e.g., incremental versus transformational). As the risk decision process proceeds, individuals and organisations will formally or informally utilise any number of mechanisms to guide, aid or facilitate the decision-making process. Decision-making can then take place in a linear set of steps or through a complex iterative process involving reflexive and recursive steps."
wg2_ch17_17.1.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"AR5 provided an extensive discussion of the costs to human and natural systems associated with climate risks. It recognised the challenges which long time frames, uncertainty and the differing values held by stakeholders create for the monetisation of losses. The AR6 SROCC built on the discussion of cultural values—typically also difficult to monetise—through a consideration of cultural ecosystem services and cultural forms of valuation, with cases from high mountain areas and polar regions (Hock et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c). AR6 expands this discussion of multiple forms of valuation in several ways. It considers regulation and litigation as mechanisms for promoting the consideration of both monetisable and non-monetisable losses in decision-making (Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter). AR5 treated the issues of equity and justice primarily with regard to mitigation, especially in WGIII AR5 Chapter 3 (Kolstad et al., 2014); these issues in the adaptation sphere are considered extensively in this chapter in areas such as finance, governance, success of adaptation, maladaptation, and monitoring and evaluation. The discussions of maladaptation and success of adaptation (Section 17.5) consider questions of synergies and trade-offs across values and goals, while the consideration of decision processes and tools shows opportunities to use co-benefits to promote effective decision-making, including approaches to decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty (Section 17.3; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter). Successful adaptation across the report (as specified in Chapter 1) is associated with conditions when co-benefits are high and (negative) trade-offs are low."
wg2_ch17_17.1.2.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter assesses the evidence of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (see AR6 Glossary, Annex II) and their approaches as part of the adaptation process at the national, local and project level as well as in global assessments (Section 17.5.2; Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter). M&E can serve multiple functions, for example, to: (1) facilitate an understanding on whether and how interventions work in achieving intended objectives; (2) inform ongoing and future implementation; and (3) provide information that helps to substantiate upward and downward accountability (Preston et al., 2009; UNFCCC, 2010b; Pringle, 2011; Spearman and McGray, 2011) (see BOX 17.1 for more discussion). This chapter also addresses the relevance of iterative learning as part of the design of M&E processes, as a means by which actors and institutions engaged in M&E acquire new insights on how these processes work (or not) to achieve set objectives."
wg2_ch17_17.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The chapter is organised around the broad narrative of climate risk decision-making and management (Figure 17.1), building from the assessment of risks within RKRs (Chapter 16) and options available to address these risks and within a broader context of climate resilient development pathways (Chapter 18). Decision-making is considered to be a reflexive and recursive process where different evidentiary threads and information inputs become relevant to the understanding and assessment of factors underlying specific decisions. Additionally, this is also a discursive process, whereby actors and institutions’ interpretations of climate risks are also key to these deliberations."
wg2_ch17_17.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Decision-making processes of risk management and adaptation are varied and numerous. Section 17.2 assesses the risk management and adaptation options already in practice. Section 17.3 assesses decision-support methods and tools available for application and the effectiveness of these in supporting climate decision-making across degrees of uncertainties and levels of governance and expected reach (scale) across populations from households to international cooperation. Closely interlinked across the decision-making process are the enabling and catalysing conditions for decisions on adaptation and risk management (Section 17.4). Section 17.5 synthesises evidence on maladaptation and adaptation successes, and assesses the current knowledge on M&E of adaptation, including financial accounting, to support learning on those, respectively. Here, M&E is considered distinct from the tracking of financial flows related to adaptation, given that financial accounting does not necessarily provide information on the implementation of adaptation measures and their results (see also Section 17.2.1.2). Finally, in Section 17.6, decision-making, climate risk responses and their relevance for climate resilient development are presented, where evidence on their respective contributions to facilitate actions in the adaptation solution space within a broader context for development is shown (Chapter 18). Throughout the decision-making process, crucial feedback loops are present that define the results of specific actions and recursive nature of climate risk management and adaptation."
wg2_ch17_box-17.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Whether an adaptation is considered successful is context specific. It depends on who evaluates adaptation and at what time as well as on the ability to compare the outcome of adaptation with a hypothetical situation without adaptation and without other parallel changes, such as development interventions (Singh et al., 2021; Dilling et al., 2019). The ability to compare the risk situation post and prior adaptation is complicated through the long time horizons at which adaptation outcomes often become apparent (Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1; Section 17.5.1; Dilling et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_box-17.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"However, a wealth of information has recently become available on how success and effectiveness of adaptation could be assessed, defined or investigated in certain settings (Patt and Schröter, 2008; Morecroft Michael et al., 2019; Tubi and Williams, 2021) or across a larger set of adaptations (Hegger et al., 2012; Eriksen et al., 2015; Gajjar et al., 2019a; Owen, 2020; Singh et al., 2021). Accordingly, successful adaptation is understood as effective adaptation, in that it reduces climate impacts, vulnerabilities and risk, and additionally balances synergies and trade-offs across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values (Eriksen et al., 2015; Juhola et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2019a; Owen, 2020; Singh et al., 2021). Across this report, four factors are identified as enabling conditions of successful adaptation, which include a focus on recognitional, procedural and distributional justice as well as flexible and strong institutions that seek policy integration and account for long-term goals."
wg2_ch17_box-17.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"To operationalize ‘success’ in this chapter, it is characterised by the degree to which an adaptation response benefits (1) human systems (number of people), (2) ecosystems or ecosystem services, (3) marginalised ethnic groups, (4) women and girls, (5) and low-income populations, and can be characterised as (6) transformational adaptation, and (7) contributing to greenhouse gas emission reductions (Section 17.5.1). Overarching to these factors are uncertainty and potential path dependency of decisions that may result in lock-in and maladaptation in the long term, and recognition that what is successful in the near term is not necessarily successful in the long term."
wg2_ch17_box-17.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Success in adaptation is antithetical to maladaptation. Maladaptation refers to current or potential future negative consequences, including failed or partially successful adaptation (or risk reduction) but also trade-offs or side effects of adaptation (see Glossary, Annex II). Thus, success of adaptation and maladaptation form the ends of a continuum that represents the balancing of synergies and trade-offs across regions, populations or sectors (Singh et al., 2016; Magnan et al., 2020; Schipper, 2020). Every adaptation action may be placed along such a continuum reflecting the empirical evidence of adaptation practices and their assessment (Section 17.5)."
wg2_ch17_17.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"There has been substantial progress in risk management and adaptation responses around the world, as demonstrated in the sectoral and regional chapters of this report and illustrated in Chapter 16. This section presents an overview of different options available to manage risk, explaining how they are currently governed and the extent to which they can be applied around the world. The section contains an assessment of the ways in which different options are being combined to create adaptation portfolios, and describes how incremental and transformational change is starting to be considered. Based on the human dimension of climate change, as described in Chapter 8, vulnerability, inequality and poverty influence these portfolios of adaptation and transformational change. Particularly for change where residual risks remain that may lead to exceeding the limits of adaptation, increasingly transformational adaptation and policy innovation will be important. Section 17.2.1 assesses options for climate risk management from around the world that reduce, manage or retain climate-related risks and assesses their contribution to reducing vulnerability and exposure, how they are governed, and the benefits to humans and ecosystems. Section 17.2.2 presents portfolios of risk management, including the design principles and observed variations across the globe, before it discusses the need and potential for transformational adaptation to complement incremental adaptation, for which we present evidence across the report for selected adaptation options and some key risks. The Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter synthesises recent literature and assesses key strands of the international policy dialogue on Loss and Damage, which discusses options that help to deal with impacts and residual risks in vulnerable countries."
wg2_ch17_17.2.1_p1,17.2.1.1 Adaptation Options and Their Contribution to Reduce Vulnerability and Exposure ,"This section assesses options for climate risk management (CRM) across common risk settings that have been grouped into Representative Key Risks (RKRs; see Section 16.5.2.2). These risk management and adaptation actions target the components of risk: hazards, vulnerabilities and exposure associated with sudden or slow-onset events (see Chapter 1 for more details on the definition of risk)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.1_p2,17.2.1.1 Adaptation Options and Their Contribution to Reduce Vulnerability and Exposure ,"For each of the RKRs, three commonly discussed adaptation options are identified across the regional, sectoral and cross-chapter papers of this report. These 24 options have been selected to cover a representative variety of strategies to adapt to climate change, while a particular adaptation option can be relevant to many of the RKRs. For example, the adaptations listed under the RKR of ‘Food security’ are also related to the RKR on ‘Human health’ (Ebi and Prats, 2015). See SM17.1 for more detail. The list is not comprehensive of all possible adaptations listed in the regional and sectoral chapters. For example, this does not include adaptations by institutions who might become unable to cope with increasing pace and magnitude of extreme events (Chapter 11)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Table 17.1 provides examples of each of these 24 adaptation options from across AR6 WGII. Detailed information about sectors and regions where these adaptations are being discussed can be found in the indicated chapters. Note that this list is curated to ensure a diversity of options; therefore, most of the options will apply to more than one RKR."
wg2_ch17_17.2.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Of this list of adaptation options, many focus on reducing vulnerability to climate change (high confidence), as vulnerability is one of the components of risk (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 8). Vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (see Chapter 1 for more details). In the world’s threatened ecosystems, reducing vulnerability often means reducing other non-climate negative pressures on ecosystems, such as pesticide use or fishery overexploitation (Section 3.3)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Vulnerability reduction is also a major focus in human systems, and this includes development of investments that help people adapt to climate change. Examples include irrigation or diversifying crops. Building infrastructure resilient to climate-related risks is another example; many of the structural and physical adaptation options can reduce sensitivity to disasters, such as elevating houses or doing beach nourishment in coastal areas (Section 15.5). Extreme events often catalyse investment in adaptation to reduce vulnerability for the future (Kreibich et al., 2017; Slavíková et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Next to vulnerability reduction, a large number of adaptation options focus on reducing exposure to climate change (high confidence). Selecting low-risk locations is the most basic example of reducing exposure; for example, private companies are relocating factories to reduce flood-related disruptions to their supply chain (Neise and Revilla Diez, 2019), and species are autonomously adjusting their ranges to a changing climate (Section 2.4).

Policymakers are charged to evaluate risk comprehensively, deciding on a variety of measures that are effective, feasible and aligned with other policy goals for a specific place, or implementing a new activity because of how it complements the existing package of risk management activities (Girard et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Portfolios of adaptation options generally include actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure, complemented by risk financing mechanisms that help people avoid the impacts of loss events, particularly very rare ones. There is also explicit or implicit risk retention, where further risk management is not desirable, cost-effective or feasible (Mechler and Deubelli, 2021). Risk financing can include a variety of instruments, with insurance as the most widely known. Formal insurance uptake is lower in developing and emerging economies than in wealthier countries (Ali et al., 2020). To overcome some of the barriers to insurance uptake, index-based insurance has been offered for agriculture and livestock in many developing economies, with varying levels of success (Chantarat et al., 2013; Isakson, 2015; Dewi et al., 2018). In recent years, regional disaster insurance pools for sovereign states have been established, such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) (Iyahen and Syroka, 2018). Insurance can encourage the quantitative evaluation of climate-related risks and adaptation limits, and it can incentivise risk reduction by charging lower premiums for less risky situations (Schäfer et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"While insurance is increasingly accepted as an adaptation option (Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2015), positive outcomes are not guaranteed (high confidence). First, there are concerns as to whether this will shift responsibility to the most vulnerable people to pay premiums (Surminski et al., 2016). There is also high risk for insurance to cause maladaptation (Müller et al., 2017); for example, Annan and Schlenker (2015) showed that insured crops were less well adapted to heat stress. To avoid this, people simultaneously invest in insurance and adaptations that reduce vulnerability/exposure (medium confidence) (Surminski et al., 2016; Highfield and Brody, 2017; Schäfer et al., 2019; Reguero et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The combination of interventions that reduce risk and risk financing for residual risk (often through insurance for sudden-onset events, or social protection for risks including those linked to slow-onset processes) will reduce collective risk to a certain level. For very extreme and potentially catastrophic events, it is often impossible (or financially infeasible) to fully reduce vulnerability and exposure, and people, communities and countries therefore retain risk requiring the ex post  management of unavoided and unavoidable residual impacts in case of events."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Ex-post risk management relies on national assistance, social safety nets (Section 7.4.2.1.3; Béné et al., 2012; Elmi and Minja, 2019) and support from social networks as well as lending from international institutions (high confidence) (Hochrainer-Stigler et al., 2014). Even in places where normalised losses have stabilised in recent years with investments in adaptation, effective planning to manage losses remains necessary (Jongman, 2018). Resilient recovery can support adaptation goals in periods of losses and damages (Slavíková et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"To coordinate between a suite of applicable risk management interventions, the concept of risk layering has been discussed and used in (financial) risk governance of disaster risk management (Mechler et al., 2006; Cummins and Mahul, 2009; Clarke and Mahul, 2011) and climate risk management (Lal et al., 2012; Mechler et al., 2014; Herron et al., 2015; Schäfer et al., 2016; Mechler and Deubelli, 2021). Incremental risk prevention and preparedness as well as risk financing occurs within national systems. Over the years, regional cooperation, such as through the regional sovereign insurance pools in the Caribbean, the Pacific and Africa, but also transboundary risk management elsewhere have become more important (medium confidence) (see Martinez-Diaz et al., 2019). Also, with risks increasingly experienced as severe and existential (Boyd et al., 2017), global governance and solidarity have been invoked (see Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2019; Pill, 2021), largely as part of the policy discourse on Loss and Damage (Mechler et al., 2019 ) with further momentum provided by discussions on the global goal of adaptation and recognition of climate risk as transboundary (Benzie and Persson, 2019; Cross-Chapter Box INTERREG in Chapter 16). Transformational risk management has emerged where incremental and in situ adaptation is not effective in managing risks, such as for managed or strategic retreat for communities facing severe coastal and riverine flooding (Siders et al., 2019). Transformation has not been well documented, including as to its governance (Section 17.2.2.5)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"While many studies assess adaptation trends by geographical region or by sector, the amount of residual risk varies across countries with different income and governance structures. Vulnerability, poverty and inequality, which constitute the human dimensions of climate change, affect how these portfolios of adaptation options are structured around the world (Chapter 8). Figure 17.5 depicts several illustrative ‘typologies’ of how risk is addressed. While no country or location fits any one typology, this illustrates a range of risk portfolios found in different contexts."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The first category in this typology, that of ‘extensive protection’, requires substantial financial investment (Figure 17.5). In higher-income contexts, this is often more feasible than in contexts with limited resources, and adaptation investments are more likely to include structural measures to reduce exposure, complemented by vulnerability-reducing measures and insurance protection (medium confidence). While this typology is not universally representative of high-income areas (within or between countries), expensive exposure-reduction measures tend to be easier to implement in high-income countries. For example, flood protection is largest in countries with larger amounts of public spending and least amounts of corruption (Scussolini et al., 2016). It is seen as more economically efficient to invest in expensive protection measures in wealthy regions, under different scenarios of sea level rise and river flooding, although these calculations have equity and justice implications (Peduzzi, 2017; Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). After flood events happen in regions with high levels of protection, damages are comparatively limited, and people tend to continue living in close proximity to the protected river (Mard et al., 2018). In contrast, flood displacement is higher in low-income countries (Kakinuma et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Risk financing, especially insurance, is also common in higher-income countries with well-developed insurance markets and higher levels of insurance penetration than in lower-income countries, illustrated by the purple bar in Figure 17.5 (high confidence) (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2019). Of climate-related disasters, floods and storms cause the largest amount of reported economic losses; however, at least 40% of these losses are uninsured, even in the regions with high insurance penetration (Baur et al., 2018). Government involvement in insurance schemes is associated with higher penetration rates of the general population (Paleari, 2019). While some, predominantly high-income countries can make use of disaster contingency funds or dedicated budget items, these do not exist or are not well endowed to adequately support relief, recovery and reconstruction (Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2015). To help stabilise public finance in regions with little market-based insurance coverage and fiscal response mechanisms, regional public insurance pools have been set up with donor assistance, such as in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific for flood and droughts (Schäfer et al., 2016; Surminski et al., 2016; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In contrast to the ‘extensive protection’ scenario, many regions of the world bear greater resemblance to the second typology in Figure 17.5 ‘moderate investment focused on adaptive capacity’ (medium confidence). These contexts see greater adaptation funding invested in capacity building activities to reduce vulnerability, rather than structural or ecosystem-based protection measures to reduce exposure (Biagini et al., 2014). Because of limited international and domestic finance for large structural investments to reduce exposure, the most prevalent adaptation choices in low-income contexts are household-level vulnerability-reducing measures (Koerth et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Lack of access to finance can be one of the reasons countries engage more readily in adaptive capacity-building activities. Countries that rank highly on the Corruption Perceptions Index engage less in technological solutions for risk management (Berrang-Ford et al., 2014). In addition, countries with higher levels of corruption receive less adaptation aid (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Weiler et al., 2018). Countries are more likely to receive adaptation aid if they import goods from a donor country, or are a former colony of that donor (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Weiler et al., 2018). In countries with poor governance and limited aid flows, remittances make up a substantial portion of finance available to the local population for risk management (Samuwai and Hills, 2018)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"Risk financing does play a large role in the ‘moderate investment’ category; there are a variety of instruments in use globally. Many countries in the Global South have created national policies and a number of regional catastrophe risk insurance pools, subsidised by international assistance, which make pay-outs to the national government of affected nations when an extreme event happens and have helped to build risk awareness (Clarke et al., 2015; Thirawat et al., 2017). Beyond this, residual risk is often borne directly by affected people (Andrianarimanana, 2015)."

SIDS can often find themselves in this situation, because small populations, small economies, lack of economies of scale, subsistence livelihoods and other challenges mean risk reduction and risk financing are both costly (Chapter 15)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Another example of this third typology are people living in conflict-affected areas. These populations are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (Basher, 2006; OCHA, 2011; IPCC, 2012; Zommers and Singh, 2014; Marktanner et al., 2015; Walch, 2018; Eckstein et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019). In conflict-affected areas similar to the third category of ‘little adaptation investment’, a combination of high vulnerability and relatively less support for adaptation means that there is a large amount of ‘residual risk’, in which residents cope with the impacts of extreme events on a regular basis (high confidence). For example, deaths from ‘natural’ disasters are 40% higher in areas that are undergoing armed conflict (Marktanner et al., 2015) (Box 17.2)."

For example, several regions are expecting an increase in visitors to eco-tourism sites or national parks with a changing climate (Fisichelli, 2015; Lwasa, 2015). In Europe, several national adaptation plans include planning for potential benefits of a changing climate, including reduced winter mortality and improved conditions for hydropower (Biesbroek et al., 2010). Recognising the need for economic diversification, people working in certain industries, such as coastal management, perceive climate change as a factor increasing the need for their services (Fatorić et al., 2017). Northern countries are taking advantage of ice-free waters for shipping routes in the Arctic (Eguiluz et al., 2016; Melia et al., 2016; IPCC, 2019c). In Africa, opportunistic adaptation has been observed by smallholder farmers, to plant crops that are better suited for a changing climate (Lalou et al., 2019). Similar agricultural adaptation in Pakistan has been associated with improved food security and reduced poverty (Ali and Erenstein, 2017; Rahman et al., 2020). In each of these cases documenting benefits, there are also potential negative impacts on other populations or ecosystems, such as ecosystem impacts from increased Arctic shipping (Ng et al., 2018)."

There is also literature proposing that the actual process of adaptation planning can enable people to take advantage of opportunities, including, for example, opportunities for larger policy and governance reform (Coleman and Sandhu, 1965; Ernst and Preston, 2017; Brown et al., 2017a)."

Section 16.4 presents evidence on RKRs where a need for transformational adaptation and climate risk management has been identified in order to further reduce climate risks and avoid breaching adaptation limits. The following section identifies how the 24 adaptation options representative of the RKRs may support incremental and transformational risk management/adaptation that can lead to small, medium and large systemic change, often as part of portfolios of options. This subsection further discusses the role of transformational adaptation vis á vis incremental adaptation by reviewing evidence across chapters (see also Box 17.3). The Cross Chapter Box on Loss and Damage further expands on the international debate regarding the role of decision-making on incremental and transformational adaptation for dealing with residual risks to address soft as well as hard adaptation limits (see Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"As the literature distinguishes active transformation to shape future risks from passive and unintended transformation (Lonsdale et al., 2015; Chapter 1), the section queries how to inspire actors to consider how to develop or implement transformational adaptation to complement incremental adaptation/risk management when and where appropriate."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"In contrast to a broadening literature on conceptualisation and policy proposal, there has been little evidence reported in the literature on transformational adaptation and risk management at scale of implementation (high confidence) (Klein et al., 2017; Ajibade and Egge, 2019; Tàbara et al., 2019; Mechler and Deubelli, 2021). Deubelli and Venkateswaran (2021) review evidence on largely non-governmental organisation (NGO)-implemented community-level adaptation for floods, heat and drought across the globe. They suggest that transformational adaptation success, while multi-facetted and challenging, depends on the availability of appropriate enabling environments including experiential and niche learning, alignment of transformational change objectives with strategic (government or other actor’s) priorities, strong bottom-up governance grounded in local contexts, phased long-term program support and appropriate financing."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"To distinguish incremental from transformational adaptation, Lonsdale et al. (2015), building on Mustelin and Handmer (2013), identify criteria related to framing, learning and decision-making, space and time, power, and type of change management. Tàbara et al. (2019), additionally discuss transformation in light of informing climate pathways, strategies and solutions. Broadly considering these criteria, they identify 12 dimensions with additional discussion of change with regard to systems and dynamics, options and solutions, agency, and the consideration of equity (see also Chapters 1, 6, 18 for more discussion). In particular, the following key aspects for understanding the spectrum from incremental to transformational adaptation are of relevance: change, within or across the system; agency, single or heterogenous; a role for visioning and normative futures; the type of learning required (from first order, business-as-usual, to second order); and how equity and distributional issues are explicit."

Adaptations that are more transformational offer potential to lead to systemic change. Less transformational adaptations allow people to address specific climate-related risks while maintaining existing systems (see SM17.1 for more details; see also Box 17.3)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"For example, several adaptations related to the RKR on risks to peace and migration, namely permanent migration, and cooperative governance, require moderate to high levels of transformation (high confidence).

Spatial planning, including urban zoning, also tends to be more transformational (medium confidence)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"On the other end of the spectrum, disaster early-warning systems tend to be incremental rather than transformational (high confidence), because they enable people to maintain/protect existing systems. Several other adaptations allow people to maintain livelihoods and systems in the face of changing risks.

For example, while the goal of cooperative governance can be to support the marginalised, these same marginalised groups are usually excluded from participating in the design of the solutions, and many articles criticise governance results as protecting only the interests of the wealthier and more powerful parties in the negotiations, especially in governance of migration (Groutsis et al., 2015; Pijnenburg et al., 2018). This reinforces the need for context-specific planning to ensure marginalised groups will benefit from an adaptation plan.

As a key area of advancement since AR5, this section assesses the relationship of residual risks, limits and incremental as well as transformational adaptation integrating the assessment of limits in Section 16.4 with Chapter 17 adaptation and risk management assessment along a spectrum of adaptation change. Section 17.2.2.5 thus contributes to understanding in which systems and regions transformational adaptation is increasingly required and considered once incremental adjustments are exhausted in the context of soft and hard limits."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Assessing risk and limits requires in-depth analysis of the adaptability of human and natural systems under different warming and risk levels, also considering socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability drivers, informed by perspectives on what breaching limits means, especially if significant change and losses and damages occur (Sections 16.4, 8.4). Assessments differ between natural systems (where adaptation potential is often very limited; Klein et al., 2014) and human systems where incremental and transformational adaptation can help to extend soft limits so that hard limits are not met or to buy time until hard limits are reached with higher levels of warming."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"The assessment synthesises global and regional evidence across regional and thematic report chapters along a continuum from observed to projected impacts and risks, the spectrum of incremental and transformational adaptation, and finally any evidence on soft and hard limits. We present regional evidence for two types of salient natural and human systems and RKRs: RKR-B (risk to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems), where we assess risks from marine heatwaves to coral reefs; and RKR- E (risk of heat on human health as a human system). Both RKRs and systems are facing substantial (residual) risk, characterised by adaptation limits and sharing heatwaves as the hazard, for which climate change has been considered the major driver of increasing intensity and frequency (high confidence) (IPCC, 2021). The assessment synthesises evidence on transformation as reported in the chapters as well as categorises identified adaptation options along an adaptation spectrum according to the criteria discussed in Section 17.2.2.4, specifically whether adaptation leads to systems’ change or only change within a system is driven by multi-scale agency and considers equity impacts specifically."

The discussion shows that heat has become a significant health risk globally, incurring severe mortality and morbidity in all world regions with annual heat-related deaths estimated around 300,000 with millions affected (high confidence) (Section 9.3.1). Evidence shows that adaptation and risk management can be effective in reducing (relative) risks in developed countries, with inconclusive evidence in low-middle-income states (Sections 9.2.4.1, 13.7.3, 13.6). In absolute terms, risk in terms of heat-related mortality and morbidity is projected to increase under medium and high heating scenarios in many regions, even with implemented adaptation. By 2050 (compared with 1961–1991 and for a mid-range emissions scenario), an excess of 94,000 deaths yr −1 is projected globally as attributable to climate change (Section 9.3.1)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"Planned and implemented adaptation interventions in all regions have remained largely incremental, while uptake is being intensified in some regions; options have included air conditioning (as autonomously deployed), public cooling spaces, heat action plans that incorporate early warning and response and heat-adapted building design (Sections 9.9.5, 11.3.6, 12.5.6.1.1,13.11.3, 13.11.3, 15.6.2)."

Also, it may mean bolstering social safety nets and health systems that better attend to heat impacts by providing universal coverage. Societal and political transformations to reduce climate change risks for vulnerable groups are considered particularly relevant in some regions (Sections 9.4.2.1.2, 9.9.5, 10.4.6.4.3, 12.5.3.2, 13.6.2.1, 14.6).

wg2_ch17_17.2.2.5_p13,NO_TITLE,"Planned adaptation can help to buy some limited time, including through recovery and restoration efforts that target resistant coral populations and interventions to culture heat-tolerant algal symbionts as well as by setting up marine protected areas. Under higher warming levels, transformation has been proposed as possibly complementing available management approaches with high-risk interventions, including enhanced corals and reef shading, which may help to sustain some coral reef systems beyond 1.5°C of global warming. Modelling has shown, however, that the effectiveness of such high-risk interventions declines beyond 2°C of global warming (Figure 3.23, Section 3.4.2.1) (medium confidence)."

Concurrent with the loss of coral reefs, important ecosystem services, including to fishery, tourism and coastal protection, would be lost. Transformational adaptation, while requiring difficult choices to be made, is being discussed to help overcome soft limits through livelihood diversification for alternative income sources, assisted migration and planned relocation of communities dependent on the services provided by the reef ecosystem (medium confidence) (Section 3.5.2)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Portfolios of adaptation options generally include actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure, complemented by risk financing mechanisms that help people avoid the impacts of loss events, particularly very rare ones. There is also explicit or implicit risk retention, where further risk management is not desirable, cost-effective or feasible (Mechler and Deubelli, 2021). Risk financing can include a variety of instruments, with insurance as the most widely known. Formal insurance uptake is lower in developing and emerging economies than in wealthier countries (Ali et al., 2020). To overcome some of the barriers to insurance uptake, index-based insurance has been offered for agriculture and livestock in many developing economies, with varying levels of success (Chantarat et al., 2013; Isakson, 2015; Dewi et al., 2018). In recent years, regional disaster insurance pools for sovereign states have been established, such as the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) (Iyahen and Syroka, 2018). Insurance can encourage the quantitative evaluation of climate-related risks and adaptation limits, and it can incentivise risk reduction by charging lower premiums for less risky situations (Schäfer et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"While insurance is increasingly accepted as an adaptation option (Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2015), positive outcomes are not guaranteed (high confidence). First, there are concerns as to whether this will shift responsibility to the most vulnerable people to pay premiums (Surminski et al., 2016). There is also high risk for insurance to cause maladaptation (Müller et al., 2017); for example, Annan and Schlenker (2015) showed that insured crops were less well adapted to heat stress. To avoid this, people simultaneously invest in insurance and adaptations that reduce vulnerability/exposure (medium confidence) (Surminski et al., 2016; Highfield and Brody, 2017; Schäfer et al., 2019; Reguero et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The combination of interventions that reduce risk and risk financing for residual risk (often through insurance for sudden-onset events, or social protection for risks including those linked to slow-onset processes) will reduce collective risk to a certain level. For very extreme and potentially catastrophic events, it is often impossible (or financially infeasible) to fully reduce vulnerability and exposure, and people, communities and countries therefore retain risk requiring the ex post  management of unavoided and unavoidable residual impacts in case of events."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Ex-post risk management relies on national assistance, social safety nets (Section 7.4.2.1.3; Béné et al., 2012; Elmi and Minja, 2019) and support from social networks as well as lending from international institutions (high confidence) (Hochrainer-Stigler et al., 2014). Even in places where normalised losses have stabilised in recent years with investments in adaptation, effective planning to manage losses remains necessary (Jongman, 2018). Resilient recovery can support adaptation goals in periods of losses and damages (Slavíková et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"To coordinate between a suite of applicable risk management interventions, the concept of risk layering has been discussed and used in (financial) risk governance of disaster risk management (Mechler et al., 2006; Cummins and Mahul, 2009; Clarke and Mahul, 2011) and climate risk management (Lal et al., 2012; Mechler et al., 2014; Herron et al., 2015; Schäfer et al., 2016; Mechler and Deubelli, 2021). Incremental risk prevention and preparedness as well as risk financing occurs within national systems. Over the years, regional cooperation, such as through the regional sovereign insurance pools in the Caribbean, the Pacific and Africa, but also transboundary risk management elsewhere have become more important (medium confidence) (see Martinez-Diaz et al., 2019). Also, with risks increasingly experienced as severe and existential (Boyd et al., 2017), global governance and solidarity have been invoked (see Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2019; Pill, 2021), largely as part of the policy discourse on Loss and Damage (Mechler et al., 2019 ) with further momentum provided by discussions on the global goal of adaptation and recognition of climate risk as transboundary (Benzie and Persson, 2019; Cross-Chapter Box INTERREG in Chapter 16). Transformational risk management has emerged where incremental and in situ adaptation is not effective in managing risks, such as for managed or strategic retreat for communities facing severe coastal and riverine flooding (Siders et al., 2019). Transformation has not been well documented, including as to its governance (Section 17.2.2.5)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"While many studies assess adaptation trends by geographical region or by sector, the amount of residual risk varies across countries with different income and governance structures. Vulnerability, poverty and inequality, which constitute the human dimensions of climate change, affect how these portfolios of adaptation options are structured around the world (Chapter 8). Figure 17.5 depicts several illustrative ‘typologies’ of how risk is addressed. While no country or location fits any one typology, this illustrates a range of risk portfolios found in different contexts."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The first category in this typology, that of ‘extensive protection’, requires substantial financial investment (Figure 17.5). In higher-income contexts, this is often more feasible than in contexts with limited resources, and adaptation investments are more likely to include structural measures to reduce exposure, complemented by vulnerability-reducing measures and insurance protection (medium confidence). While this typology is not universally representative of high-income areas (within or between countries), expensive exposure-reduction measures tend to be easier to implement in high-income countries. For example, flood protection is largest in countries with larger amounts of public spending and least amounts of corruption (Scussolini et al., 2016). It is seen as more economically efficient to invest in expensive protection measures in wealthy regions, under different scenarios of sea level rise and river flooding, although these calculations have equity and justice implications (Peduzzi, 2017; Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). After flood events happen in regions with high levels of protection, damages are comparatively limited, and people tend to continue living in close proximity to the protected river (Mard et al., 2018). In contrast, flood displacement is higher in low-income countries (Kakinuma et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Risk financing, especially insurance, is also common in higher-income countries with well-developed insurance markets and higher levels of insurance penetration than in lower-income countries, illustrated by the purple bar in Figure 17.5 (high confidence) (Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2019). Of climate-related disasters, floods and storms cause the largest amount of reported economic losses; however, at least 40% of these losses are uninsured, even in the regions with high insurance penetration (Baur et al., 2018). Government involvement in insurance schemes is associated with higher penetration rates of the general population (Paleari, 2019). While some, predominantly high-income countries can make use of disaster contingency funds or dedicated budget items, these do not exist or are not well endowed to adequately support relief, recovery and reconstruction (Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2015). To help stabilise public finance in regions with little market-based insurance coverage and fiscal response mechanisms, regional public insurance pools have been set up with donor assistance, such as in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific for flood and droughts (Schäfer et al., 2016; Surminski et al., 2016; Linnerooth-Bayer et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"In contrast to the ‘extensive protection’ scenario, many regions of the world bear greater resemblance to the second typology in Figure 17.5 ‘moderate investment focused on adaptive capacity’ (medium confidence). These contexts see greater adaptation funding invested in capacity building activities to reduce vulnerability, rather than structural or ecosystem-based protection measures to reduce exposure (Biagini et al., 2014). Because of limited international and domestic finance for large structural investments to reduce exposure, the most prevalent adaptation choices in low-income contexts are household-level vulnerability-reducing measures (Koerth et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Lack of access to finance can be one of the reasons countries engage more readily in adaptive capacity-building activities. Countries that rank highly on the Corruption Perceptions Index engage less in technological solutions for risk management (Berrang-Ford et al., 2014). In addition, countries with higher levels of corruption receive less adaptation aid (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Weiler et al., 2018). Countries are more likely to receive adaptation aid if they import goods from a donor country, or are a former colony of that donor (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Weiler et al., 2018). In countries with poor governance and limited aid flows, remittances make up a substantial portion of finance available to the local population for risk management (Samuwai and Hills, 2018)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"Risk financing does play a large role in the ‘moderate investment’ category; there are a variety of instruments in use globally. Many countries in the Global South have created national policies and a number of regional catastrophe risk insurance pools, subsidised by international assistance, which make pay-outs to the national government of affected nations when an extreme event happens and have helped to build risk awareness (Clarke et al., 2015; Thirawat et al., 2017). Beyond this, residual risk is often borne directly by affected people (Andrianarimanana, 2015)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"In the third typology, there are limited resources for adaptation, and populations bear large amounts of residual risk (depicted by the purple bar in the third typology in Figure 17.5, ‘little adaptation investment’). SIDS can often find themselves in this situation, because small populations, small economies, lack of economies of scale, subsistence livelihoods and other challenges mean risk reduction and risk financing are both costly (Chapter 15)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.2_p12,NO_TITLE,"Another example of this third typology are people living in conflict-affected areas. These populations are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (Basher, 2006; OCHA, 2011; IPCC, 2012; Zommers and Singh, 2014; Marktanner et al., 2015; Walch, 2018; Eckstein et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2019). In conflict-affected areas similar to the third category of ‘little adaptation investment’, a combination of high vulnerability and relatively less support for adaptation means that there is a large amount of ‘residual risk’, in which residents cope with the impacts of extreme events on a regular basis (high confidence). For example, deaths from ‘natural’ disasters are 40% higher in areas that are undergoing armed conflict (Marktanner et al., 2015) (Box 17.2)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Several studies and many government planning documents reference how people can benefit from a changed climate, beyond reducing risks. For example, several regions are expecting an increase in visitors to eco-tourism sites or national parks with a changing climate (Fisichelli, 2015; Lwasa, 2015). In Europe, several national adaptation plans include planning for potential benefits of a changing climate, including reduced winter mortality and improved conditions for hydropower (Biesbroek et al., 2010). Recognising the need for economic diversification, people working in certain industries, such as coastal management, perceive climate change as a factor increasing the need for their services (Fatorić et al., 2017). Northern countries are taking advantage of ice-free waters for shipping routes in the Arctic (Eguiluz et al., 2016; Melia et al., 2016; IPCC, 2019c). In Africa, opportunistic adaptation has been observed by smallholder farmers, to plant crops that are better suited for a changing climate (Lalou et al., 2019). Similar agricultural adaptation in Pakistan has been associated with improved food security and reduced poverty (Ali and Erenstein, 2017; Rahman et al., 2020). In each of these cases documenting benefits, there are also potential negative impacts on other populations or ecosystems, such as ecosystem impacts from increased Arctic shipping (Ng et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"While adaptation is rarely focused on taking advantage of opportunities presented by a changed climate, there are numerous co-benefits of adaptation opportunities, from health to reduced emissions to ecosystem services (high confidence) (Watts et al., 2015; Geneletti and Zardo, 2016; Spencer et al., 2016). There is also literature proposing that the actual process of adaptation planning can enable people to take advantage of opportunities, including, for example, opportunities for larger policy and governance reform (Coleman and Sandhu, 1965; Ernst and Preston, 2017; Brown et al., 2017a)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Section 1.4.5 noted that transformational adaptation is increasingly being considered necessary to allow a system to extend beyond its (soft) limits as incremental adaptation cannot guarantee to avoid intolerable risks. Section 16.4 presents evidence on RKRs where a need for transformational adaptation and climate risk management has been identified in order to further reduce climate risks and avoid breaching adaptation limits. The following section identifies how the 24 adaptation options representative of the RKRs may support incremental and transformational risk management/adaptation that can lead to small, medium and large systemic change, often as part of portfolios of options. This subsection further discusses the role of transformational adaptation vis á vis incremental adaptation by reviewing evidence across chapters (see also Box 17.3). The Cross Chapter Box on Loss and Damage further expands on the international debate regarding the role of decision-making on incremental and transformational adaptation for dealing with residual risks to address soft as well as hard adaptation limits (see Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"As the literature distinguishes active transformation to shape future risks from passive and unintended transformation (Lonsdale et al., 2015; Chapter 1), the section queries how to inspire actors to consider how to develop or implement transformational adaptation to complement incremental adaptation/risk management when and where appropriate."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"In contrast to a broadening literature on conceptualisation and policy proposal, there has been little evidence reported in the literature on transformational adaptation and risk management at scale of implementation (high confidence) (Klein et al., 2017; Ajibade and Egge, 2019; Tàbara et al., 2019; Mechler and Deubelli, 2021). Deubelli and Venkateswaran (2021) review evidence on largely non-governmental organisation (NGO)-implemented community-level adaptation for floods, heat and drought across the globe. They suggest that transformational adaptation success, while multi-facetted and challenging, depends on the availability of appropriate enabling environments including experiential and niche learning, alignment of transformational change objectives with strategic (government or other actor’s) priorities, strong bottom-up governance grounded in local contexts, phased long-term program support and appropriate financing."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"To distinguish incremental from transformational adaptation, Lonsdale et al. (2015), building on Mustelin and Handmer (2013), identify criteria related to framing, learning and decision-making, space and time, power, and type of change management. Tàbara et al. (2019), additionally discuss transformation in light of informing climate pathways, strategies and solutions. Broadly considering these criteria, they identify 12 dimensions with additional discussion of change with regard to systems and dynamics, options and solutions, agency, and the consideration of equity (see also Chapters 1, 6, 18 for more discussion). In particular, the following key aspects for understanding the spectrum from incremental to transformational adaptation are of relevance: change, within or across the system; agency, single or heterogenous; a role for visioning and normative futures; the type of learning required (from first order, business-as-usual, to second order); and how equity and distributional issues are explicit."

Adaptations that are more transformational offer potential to lead to systemic change. Less transformational adaptations allow people to address specific climate-related risks while maintaining existing systems (see SM17.1 for more details; see also Box 17.3)."
wg2_ch17_17.2.2.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"For example, several adaptations related to the RKR on risks to peace and migration, namely permanent migration, and cooperative governance, require moderate to high levels of transformation (high confidence).

Spatial planning, including urban zoning, also tends to be more transformational (medium confidence)."

Several other adaptations allow people to maintain livelihoods and systems in the face of changing risks.

For example, while the goal of cooperative governance can be to support the marginalised, these same marginalised groups are usually excluded from participating in the design of the solutions, and many articles criticise governance results as protecting only the interests of the wealthier and more powerful parties in the negotiations, especially in governance of migration (Groutsis et al., 2015; Pijnenburg et al., 2018).

As a key area of advancement since AR5, this section assesses the relationship of residual risks, limits and incremental as well as transformational adaptation integrating the assessment of limits in Section 16.4 with Chapter 17 adaptation and risk management assessment along a spectrum of adaptation change. Section 17.2.2.5 thus contributes to understanding in which systems and regions transformational adaptation is increasingly required and considered once incremental adjustments are exhausted in the context of soft and hard limits."

Assessments differ between natural systems (where adaptation potential is often very limited; Klein et al., 2014) and human systems where incremental and transformational adaptation can help to extend soft limits so that hard limits are not met or to buy time until hard limits are reached with higher levels of warming."

We present regional evidence for two types of salient natural and human systems and RKRs: RKR-B (risk to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems), where we assess risks from marine heatwaves to coral reefs; and RKR- E (risk of heat on human health as a human system). Both RKRs and systems are facing substantial (residual) risk, characterised by adaptation limits and sharing heatwaves as the hazard, for which climate change has been considered the major driver of increasing intensity and frequency (high confidence) (IPCC, 2021). The assessment synthesises evidence on transformation as reported in the chapters as well as categorises identified adaptation options along an adaptation spectrum according to the criteria discussed in Section 17.2.2.4, specifically whether adaptation leads to systems’ change or only change within a system is driven by multi-scale agency and considers equity impacts specifically."

The discussion shows that heat has become a significant health risk globally, incurring severe mortality and morbidity in all world regions with annual heat-related deaths estimated around 300,000 with millions affected (high confidence) (Section 9.3.1). Evidence shows that adaptation and risk management can be effective in reducing (relative) risks in developed countries, with inconclusive evidence in low-middle-income states (Sections 9.2.4.1, 13.7.3, 13.6). In absolute terms, risk in terms of heat-related mortality and morbidity is projected to increase under medium and high heating scenarios in many regions, even with implemented adaptation. By 2050 (compared with 1961–1991 and for a mid-range emissions scenario), an excess of 94,000 deaths yr −1 is projected globally as attributable to climate change (Section 9.3.1)."

Such impacts perpetuate cycles of poverty (World Bank, 2013), making conflict-affected populations more susceptible to suffer from climate-related events (Basher, 2006; Coughlan de Perez et al., 2019). For example, in Mindanao, Philippines, poverty is closely linked to long-standing armed conflicts; both climate change and conflict have significantly increased smallholder vulnerability, resulting in loss of livelihoods, financial assets, agricultural yield and the worsening of debt problems (Chandra et al., 2017). In Colombia, displacement induced by conflict has pushed the population to live in high-risk areas such as steep slopes susceptible to landslides and river banks exposed to flooding (Albuja and Adarve, 2011). This conflict-induced vulnerability, with little adaptation activity, has in turn resulted in climate-related disasters (Kuipers, 2019; Siddiqi et al., 2019)."

For example, cooperation in the Philippines between Moro Islamic Liberation Front and United Nations agencies included training of farmers in disaster risk reduction, drought management and production of improved crop varieties to support a transition away from subsistence farming (Walch, 2018). In Mali, negotiations on fertilizer access and safe transport to agricultural lands were brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and in Afghanistan, conflict-sensitive approaches have promoted ecosystem-based adaptation to support reforestation (Walch, 2018; Mena and Hilhorst, 2020).

The importance of iterative risk management is emphasised because risk and adaptation are dynamic. It also identified that (i) risk assessments, decision-support tools, early-warning systems, accounting for uncertainty and delivering no-regret options by examining trade-offs are important, (ii) integration across different governance portfolios is needed due to potential conflict of different actions between portfolios, and (iii) planning, implementation and decision-making, including the use of methods, are dependent on local context."

These communities of decision analysts can act like broad-based statisticians to advise on matching methods to the climate risk and its context, before individual decision specialists are consulted. Some scientific literature is presenting guides for choosing different methods, tools and approaches (Shi et al., 2019). This sub-subsection provides a summary guide for policy analysts and decision makers to help identify the classes of decision-analytic methods that may be suitable for their context for managing climate risks. It focuses on decision-analytic methods, noting that decision-support tools will underpin many of these methods by organising information (Bourne et al., 2016; Papathanasiou et al., 2016; Ceccato et al., 2018; Haße and Kind, 2018) or support modelling (Papathanasiou et al., 2016; Kwakkel, 2017; Gardiner et al., 2018), sometimes with a particular decision-analytic process in mind (Hadka et al., 2015; Torresan et al., 2016; Tonmoy et al., 2018)."

Framing the problem (Orlove et al., 2020), by modelling its relationships with the human and natural systems and eliciting objectives, values and scope of the problem from stakeholders, is a precursor to analyses of options but may be returned to whenever a phase of ‘sense-making and modelling’ is required (high confidence) (Ackermann, 2012; Keeney, 2012; Slotte and Hämäläinen, 2014; Abbas and Howard, 2015; Marttunen et al., 2017; Korhonen and Wallenius, 2020; French, 2021)."

These approaches help articulate the direct and indirect effects of fixed, long-term engineering or structural adaptations. Dynamic stochastic modelling (Fulton and Link, 2014; Ianelli et al., 2016) has been used to assess short- to medium-term interactions of more dynamic and variable sectors, such as those with annual adjustments and management of water, agriculture, land and marine uses (Holsman et al., 2019; Hollowed et al., 2020; Bahri et al., 2021). On a longer time frame, scenarios are used to test long-term interactions but often with less variability and chance (Giupponi et al., 2013; Adam et al., 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2017)."

As Cynefin has helped frame previous IPCC presentations on contexts of uncertainty (Hurlbert et al., 2019) and has a community of practice to consult on its use (French, 2020), it is used here, also because it considers the uncertainty in knowledge around cause and effect in general terms, rather than specifically focusing on uncertainty in formal models. Helmrich and Chester (2020) show how Cynefin can be used to frame climate adaptation decision-making in the infrastructure sector."

If the context is complex and chaotic the outcomes of actions will be less predictable, no matter how complex the models may be, although more complex dynamic models may be useful to test ‘what if’ scenarios in these cases (Marchau et al., 2019). Under complex and chaotic circumstances an ensemble of models and approaches may be needed to help categorise a satisfactory ‘solution space’ across the broad knowledge of relationships and dependencies, but will need to have iterative processes to update and refine adaptations as knowledge improves (Marchau et al., 2019)."

Some analyses partially ignore uncertainties relating to the former in order to focus on conflicts in the values held by different stakeholders and help structure debate (Korhonen and Wallenius, 2020; French, 2020), while others build very sophisticated models of the external world to predict potential consequences, but in doing so lose transparency and risk becoming untrustworthy black boxes to many stakeholders (low confidence) (Peterson and Thompson, 2020)."

While terminology varies among disciplines, three types of uncertainty are important in understanding assessments of the future from descriptive models: epistemic (uncertainty in model construction relating to the lack of knowledge about the system being represented), analytic (the degree to which a model fits observations, and its accuracy) and stochastic (the natural variability or randomness in the system). The probability of an event arising in the future is determined from all three uncertainties, noting that stochastic uncertainty is a property of the system rather than a limitation of research (Le Cozannet et al., 2017; Beven et al., 2018a; Beven et al., 2018b)."

The uncertainty here arises from what is an acceptable risk. Acceptability relates to the value or importance of the consequence, which may include moral and ethical uncertainties (Prober et al., 2017), as well as how ambiguous the understanding of the consequence may be between different groups (Beven et al., 2018a; Beven et al., 2018b). The development of strategies to ameliorate risk will benefit from considering these two uncertainties in specifying the risk to be managed (Prober et al., 2017; French et al., 2020) because they can help set boundaries on a required likelihood of success, rather than simply casting stakeholders or decision makers as risk averse or risk tolerant, and can help identify and accept pathways of success (Gregory et al., 2012). This can be important when decisions need to be made well in advance of the actions needing to take effect, such as for many climate risks (Chapter 1; Chapter 16; Section 17.2.3; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter)."

A summary guide for policy analysts and decision makers is presented in Table 17.4 to help identify the classes of decision-analytic methods that may be suitable for their context for managing climate risks. The table summarises how well the methods address the Cynefin context, the phase of decision-making, the types of uncertainties that exist through the decision-making process and the resources required. As terminology may vary between disciplines and research groups, suitable references to better explain the methods within the class are provided. Also, there may be overlap between the classes as individual methods are often paired with other methods to address specific requirements and approaches (Buurman and Babovic, 2016; Haasnoot et al., 2019).

Bayesian, Deep Uncertainty and elicitation methods and tools to support decision-making were the most easily located classes of methods to be used in different contexts (Figure 17.7), while the other classes were more oriented towards government processes. This result highlights a key gap at present in the need to have real-world experiences published and mapped for their utility for different tasks, thereby creating a resource for policymakers to identify suitable tools, such as in emerging communities-of-practice of decision practitioners (Watkiss and Hunt, 2013; Street et al., 2019; French, 2020)."

wg2_ch17_17.3.1.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Informal decision-making pervades decision-making in all contexts (high confidence) (Orlove et al., 2020); decisions relating to climate change are affected not only by rational processes but also by many informal, often behavioural responses to the situation, some of which may not require formal processes. Informal processes were officially studied in only a few of the publications contributing to Figure 17.8, but all of the studies have hints to informal decision-making that pervades all levels of governance. Although there are not many concrete studies, citing roles of study participants can lead to a perception of a disconnect between the process and the outcome that resulted (see Section 17.5.1 for enablers of success)."
wg2_ch17_17.3.1.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Generally, while governance requirements may define the processes of formal deliberations and decision-making, informal deliberations will carry on in parallel, supported by social media, and these informal deliberations may be used to affect the outcome of the formal processes.

Conflicting value systems may cause some stakeholders to feel side-lined, particularly if some of the key decision makers are perceived holding different personal views and interests or to have engaged in political horse-trading, which connect independent decisions. There may be emotional responses, driven by poor comprehension of risk and probabilistic information, and potential for group biases or insularity of participants (Engler et al., 2019). Well-designed decision processes recognise the informal and seek to gain information from it without introducing bias (medium confidence) (French and Argyris, 2018)."

The degree of stakeholder engagement ranges from instructive and consultative to cooperative, which are equivalent to information exchange, influence and partners in decision-making (Sen, 2000; Cattino and Reckien, in press). Since the AR5, climate change adaptation and resilience literature has seen an increase in participatory approaches that deepen engagement and overcome challenges, as well as making some assessments of their effectiveness (Newton Mann et al., 2017; Wamsler, 2017; Esteve et al., 2018), including structured interactions among different types of stakeholders and the use of place-based boundary organisations to strengthen the interactions and heighten the awareness of the institutional context. A higher degree of public participation can lead to more transformational adaptation as well as to higher ambition for local mitigation (medium confidence) (Section 17.4.4.2; Cattino and Reckien, in press). Challenges to stakeholder participation are access to state-of-the-art science, capacity to recognise and respond to non-reliable or false climate science information, and the removal of cognitive and other biases (high confidence) (Gorddard et al., 2016; Engler et al., 2019; Fulton, 2021)."

Participatory planning includes a variety of co-generative strategies and approaches (e.g., qualitative scenario or adaptation pathway development) through which goals and objectives, knowledge and strategy implementation and evaluation can be decided collaboratively between practitioners, policymaking, local interests and groups, and scientists (Butler et al., 2016; Prober et al., 2017; Symstad et al., 2017). Specifically, for climate change adaptation, these decision-making strategies can incorporate expert, Indigenous and local knowledge (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box INDIG; Gustafson et al., 2016). The challenge will be to bring together these different actors, as stakeholders tend to act within rather than among systems and procedures, and it is important that platforms are developed to integrate data effectively (Rizzo et al., 2020).

Helmrich and Chester (2020) show how Cynefin can be used to frame climate adaptation decision-making in the infrastructure sector."

The probability of an event arising in the future is determined from all three uncertainties, noting that stochastic uncertainty is a property of the system rather than a limitation of research (Le Cozannet et al., 2017; Beven et al., 2018a; Beven et al., 2018b)."

The uncertainty here arises from what is an acceptable risk. Acceptability relates to the value or importance of the consequence, which may include moral and ethical uncertainties (Prober et al., 2017), as well as how ambiguous the understanding of the consequence may be between different groups (Beven et al., 2018a; Beven et al., 2018b). The development of strategies to ameliorate risk will benefit from considering these two uncertainties in specifying the risk to be managed (Prober et al., 2017; French et al., 2020) because they can help set boundaries on a required likelihood of success, rather than simply casting stakeholders or decision makers as risk averse or risk tolerant, and can help identify and accept pathways of success (Gregory et al., 2012).

Framing the problem (Orlove et al., 2020), by modelling its relationships with the human and natural systems and eliciting objectives, values and scope of the problem from stakeholders, is a precursor to analyses of options but may be returned to whenever a phase of ‘sense-making and modelling’ is required (high confidence) (Ackermann, 2012; Keeney, 2012; Slotte and Hämäläinen, 2014; Abbas and Howard, 2015; Marttunen et al., 2017; Korhonen and Wallenius, 2020; French, 2021)."

Sensitivity and robustness analyses can be useful if conditions are favourable to supplement the decision analysis, setting bounds on some of the residual uncertainty (high confidence) (Borgonovo and Plischke, 2016; Ferretti et al., 2016).

These approaches help articulate the direct and indirect effects of fixed, long-term engineering or structural adaptations. Dynamic stochastic modelling (Fulton and Link, 2014; Ianelli et al., 2016) has been used to assess short- to medium-term interactions of more dynamic and variable sectors, such as those with annual adjustments and management of water, agriculture, land and marine uses (Holsman et al., 2019; Hollowed et al., 2020; Bahri et al., 2021).

Conflicting value systems may cause some stakeholders to feel side-lined, particularly if some of the key decision makers are perceived holding different personal views and interests or to have engaged in political horse-trading, which connect independent decisions. There may be emotional responses, driven by poor comprehension of risk and probabilistic information, and potential for group biases or insularity of participants (Engler et al., 2019).

Specifically, for climate change adaptation, these decision-making strategies can incorporate expert, Indigenous and local knowledge (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box INDIG; Gustafson et al., 2016).

Conflicting value systems may cause some stakeholders to feel side-lined, particularly if some of the key decision makers are perceived holding different personal views and interests or to have engaged in political horse-trading, which connect independent decisions.

Since the AR5, climate change adaptation and resilience literature has seen an increase in participatory approaches that deepen engagement and overcome challenges, as well as making some assessments of their effectiveness (Newton Mann et al., 2017; Wamsler, 2017; Esteve et al., 2018), including structured interactions among different types of stakeholders and the use of place-based boundary organisations to strengthen the interactions and heighten the awareness of the institutional context.

Challenges for integrated adaptation include: (1) to sufficiently capture the complexities between the nexus dimensions (Weitz et al., 2017); (2) to adequately consider the time, costs and challenges of coordination and cooperation (Wichelns, 2017); (3) to consider the political economy in which progress towards more integrated solutions could take place, not only accounting for technological requirements (Leck and Roberts, 2015); (4) to obtain sufficient temporal or spatial data to capture the interactions between natural and social processes (Shannak et al., 2018); (5) to connect these considerations to decision-making and policy processes in order to gain insights into the conditions for collaboration and coordination across sectors, including external dynamics and political and cognitive factors determining change (Weitz et al., 2017); and (6) to develop a coherent framework against which to assess results and observations (Crain et al., 2008; Wichelns, 2017)."

Prior to 2010, national framework laws tended to have a mitigation focus, while more recent laws or amendments thereto have an increased adaptation focus (Rumble, 2019b). No evidence indicates whether general or specific framework laws yield better outcomes; however, reviews of more recent examples of framework laws in Africa suggest a trend towards more specificity in the required content of adaptation strategies and duties (Rumble, 2019b)."

This approach is particularly relevant to adaptation challenges which intersect with numerous bodies of law that are dedicated to other societal concerns (Gerrard and Fischer, 2012). However, integrating such considerations can be challenging in certain areas of law, particularly those relating to property rights, water rights and endangered species protection (Gerrard and Fischer, 2012).

This helps any new climate change laws to be absorbed into, and harmonise with, the established legal system of each country (Scotford et al., 2017). Efforts are underway to assist countries in such assessments and the identification of areas for legislative reform, for example through the Commonwealth and UN Environment’s Law and Climate Change Toolkit.

Analysis of the first NDCs submitted in the lead-up to and after the Paris Agreement showed that adaptation priorities were more often articulated by developing countries and least developed countries, while developed countries and emerging economies focused mostly on mitigation (Pauw et al., 2019).

Notwithstanding implementation challenges, evidence is emerging that overarching framework laws play a foundational and distinctive role in supporting effective climate governance, including adaptation governance (Fankhauser et al., 2018), and are drivers of subsequent activity (Townshend et al., 2011; Fankhauser et al., 2014; Clare et al., 2017b), especially when formulated with clear guidance for all related actors, including lower level of governance (De Gregorio Hurtado et al., 2015). This may explain the rapid increase in both local and national climate change laws, now with an increased emphasis on regulatory provisions to increase resilience and reduce vulnerability."

Regulations and standards provide a framework for common understanding of when and under what conditions action should be taken specifically in relation to the construction and maintenance of the built environment, infrastructure and environmental and social practice (Grynning et al., 2020). Regulations and standards for climate action emerge primarily from two settings: first, as an addition or augmentation to existing regulations and standards that emerged initially to address existing potential climate extremes and stresses (e.g., size of culverts in response to maximum rainfall and runoff conditions); and second, new regulations and standards that were developed in direct response to new or emergent climate risks (e.g., regulations in response to new presence of mean monthly high tide flooding) (Qiao et al., 2018). Commonly agreed upon social norms and conventions also can be described as regulatory and providing a set of standards."

Relevant regulations and standards are especially evident in the oceans and coastal domains (Chapter 3 and CCP2, in cities and infrastructure (Chapter 6), and the water (Chapter 4) and food sectors (Chapter 5). Europe and North and South America (Chapters 12, 13 and 14) have the most frequent documented occurrences of examples of regulations and standards. Regulations and standards focused on building codes to protect against extreme event and loss, water regulations and agreements to protect water supply and lessen drought impacts, and health codes to limit heat exposure are the most frequent examples of such practices. Deficiencies of regulations and standards have been noted with respect to their capacity to manage species migrating from climate change, and to provide opportunities for transformative adaptation. The evidence from the sectors and chapters illustrate that more comprehensive regulations and standards lead to positive adaptation outcomes."

While not explicitly described in the sectoral and regional chapters of this report, the maintenance and exercise of environmental and social governance decision-making strategies do enable adaptation practice and have become especially important when formal legal and policy regimes are not yet present. As formal regulation promotes clear and common understanding of climate risks and mechanisms to develop context specific appropriate solutions, voluntary code-making and self-regulation can forestall the need for legal action or can function as precursors to the formulation and implementation of legislation, laws and regulations."

In summary, they find that analyses of the effects of voluntary pressure demonstrate that by themselves they are unlikely to bring about significant improvement in environmental outcomes. Professional organisations, however, have made progress in addressing sectoral standards relative to the adaptation process. This includes the development of new industry guidelines, codes, standards and specifications, in addition to the implementation of infrastructure inventories that incorporate evaluation of vulnerabilities and identification of priority at-risk areas (Chapter 14). Voluntary pressures by themselves are not likely to result in positive outcomes and instead should be coupled with mandatory regulatory pressure to achieve the environmental response desired (Bianco, 2020)."

As of 2019, ~1340 companies with a market capitalisation of USD 12.6 trillion and financial institutions responsible for assets of USD 150 trillion have expressed support for the TCFD (TCFD, 2020). An analysis of reports to the TCFD in 2016 showed that 83% of companies report on physical risks of climate change, and of these, 82% reported on strategies to adapt to some of the identified risks (Goldstein et al., 2019). The same analysis also noted that: (i) the total of estimates of assets at risk were two orders of magnitude lower than generally accepted estimates of total financial risk; (ii) a minority of companies consider risks outside of their own operations or in their value chains; (iii) most underestimate or do not estimate the costs of adaptation; and (iv) many assume linear impacts and responses, neglecting the potential for tipping points or acceleration in risk and potentially transformative adaptation requirements. At this stage, TCFD has influenced many companies’ thinking and comprehension of physical climate risk, but it appears too early to assess whether this has driven substantive responses to manage these risks."

Laws can facilitate climate action in multiple ways, including through: (i) mandating and guiding the behaviour of governance structures and actors, (ii) fostering coordination between different levels of government, (iii) enforcing climate responses, (iv) its symbolic value and (iv) aligning scientific evidence and societal norms (Mehling, 2015; Scotford et al., 2017). Laws also can embed climate change planning within the administrative structure of a state, rendering policy less vulnerable to revocation (Scotford et al., 2017). Extensive revision to laws has occurred in the last decade: a survey of 164 countries showed that over 1200 climate-related national laws and policies have been published, with approximately 44% being acts of parliament (Nachmany et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.2.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"National climate change laws are important for transposing ratified international commitments into domestic regimes, such as the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biodiversity, as well as voluntary agreements such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In turn, the enactment of domestic laws can yield useful experiences and foster engagements that positively influence and support the development of international commitments (Townshend and Matthews, 2013; Mehling, 2015). Strong and consistent regulatory frameworks also support the flow of climate finance to developing countries that have such frameworks (Nachmany et al., 2017). The successful implementation of national and sub-national climate change and related policies and strategies are often contingent upon the underlying legislative framework empowering, mandating or guiding their review, implementation and enforcement (Averchenkova and Matikainen, 2017; Scotford et al., 2017) (medium confidence)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.2.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Existing legal systems also pose potential barriers to adaptation, as described in Chapter 9 (Africa) and Chapter 8 (Poverty, Livelihoods and Sustainable Development). Laws may reinforce governance arrangements and regulations that do not support responses to climate change, and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and inequalities (Craig, 2010; Arnold and Gunderson, 2013; Wenta et al., 2019). In such cases, laws may require review and revision or replacement, and at the same be written in ways that foster adaptive management (Craig, 2010; Ruhl, 2010; Cosens et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.2.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Even though there is no agreed definition of or typology for climate change laws (Mehling, 2015), studies have tended to classify climate change laws as being ‘framework’ or ‘sectoral’ (see Table 17.5 for examples). Framework laws offer a comprehensive, unifying basis for climate change policy, addressing multiple aspects or areas of climate change mitigation or adaptation (or both) in a holistic and overarching manner (Townshend et al., 2011; Fankhauser et al., 2014; Nachmany et al., 2015; Clare et al., 2017b); they are powerful levers for setting national and sub-national agendas, creating climate change institutional structures, enabling policy implementation and driving the passage of additional sectoral legislation and regulations (Clare et al., 2017b). Prior to 2010, national framework laws tended to have a mitigation focus, while more recent laws or amendments thereto have an increased adaptation focus (Rumble, 2019b). No evidence indicates whether general or specific framework laws yield better outcomes; however, reviews of more recent examples of framework laws in Africa suggest a trend towards more specificity in the required content of adaptation strategies and duties (Rumble, 2019b)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.2.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"A sectoral approach to climate change legislation grafts climate-related provisions into existing laws, such as environmental impact assessment, flood insurance and infrastructure planning, collectively creating an aggregated legal landscape (Townshend et al., 2011; Gerrard and Fischer, 2012; Nachmany et al., 2015; Scotford et al., 2017; Rumble, 2019a). This approach is particularly relevant to adaptation challenges which intersect with numerous bodies of law that are dedicated to other societal concerns (Gerrard and Fischer, 2012). However, integrating such considerations can be challenging in certain areas of law, particularly those relating to property rights, water rights and endangered species protection (Gerrard and Fischer, 2012). The incorporation of adaptive management principles (including monitoring, periodic evaluation, and response modification) within existing laws can enhance their enabling role and foster greater resilience (Godden, 2012; Arnold and Gunderson, 2013; McDonald and Styles, 2014)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.2.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The legal regime for adaptation is too embryonic for assessment of good practice design and content, although similarities can be seen in the framework laws and draft bills across several countries. Some studies highlight the importance of domestic ‘whole of legal system’ analysis prior to development of modifying law. This can identify the range of existing legislative instruments that can directly intersect with climate change, along with related contextual factors such as national circumstances, governance frameworks, and political and economic realities as well as national administrative culture (Scotford et al., 2017). This helps any new climate change laws to be absorbed into, and harmonise with, the established legal system of each country (Scotford et al., 2017). Efforts are underway to assist countries in such assessments and the identification of areas for legislative reform, for example through the Commonwealth and UN Environment’s Law and Climate Change Toolkit.

The NDCs have allowed countries to articulate their priorities and ambition with respect to climate action, and it has been suggested that these can in turn lead to cascading policies (and laws) that drive and enable adaptation and climate risk management. Analysis of the first NDCs submitted in the lead-up to and after the Paris Agreement showed that adaptation priorities were more often articulated by developing countries and least developed countries, while developed countries and emerging economies focused mostly on mitigation (Pauw et al., 2019).

Also important are two other components of knowledge: of response options and knowledge of other enabling conditions, particularly governance and finance, which were mentioned less frequently and more indirectly in AR5 and SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL. Decision makers assess the feasibility of different alternatives (see Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB) and develop strategies for the implementation and modification of the alternative, requiring a level of knowledge of the governance, policy and finance landscapes at national (Tanner et al., 2019; Lopes et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020) and international scales (Woodruff, 2018)."

Local knowledge typically covers a variety of environmental domains.

This shift is a result of the recognition of benefits which a co-production approach can offer, in addition to the provision of information; these additional benefits include building confidence, capacities, learning, knowledge, social capital, institutional capacity, stakeholder relationships, social networks, beneficial management practices and strengthened institutions (Bruno Soares and Dessai, 2016; Djenontin and Meadow, 2018; Bremer et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 in WGI AR6, ‘Climate information for climate services’, shows that users are widely distributed across civil society. Relevant users of climate services include humanitarian organisations (Coughlan de Perez and Mason, 2014; Harvey et al., 2019b), government offices (Mahon et al., 2019), international agencies (Perkins and Nachmany, 2019) and the private sector (Beckett, 2016; Hudson et al., 2019). Climate services currently exist at local, national, regional and international scales, at time scales which range from sub-seasonal to decadal and longer (White et al., 2017; Hewitt et al., 2020) and in a range of different sectors (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019). Agriculture is the sector with the largest number of examples (Zebiak et al., 2015; Burke and Emerick, 2016; Cliffe et al., 2016; Haigh et al., 2018; Buontempo et al., 2020); others include health (Ghebreyesus et al., 2010; Ballester et al., 2016), forestry (Caurla and Lobianco, 2020), fisheries (Busch et al., 2016), disaster risk reduction (Street et al., 2019) and water resources management (van Vliet et al., 2015; Golding et al., 2019). Evaluations of the extent to which climate services are accessed, used and deliver benefits to decision makers remain in an initial stage (Perrels, 2020), though studies suggest that these contributions vary widely depending on context. A review of evaluation of weather and climate agricultural services in Africa, for instance, found that most farmers use climate services when they are available , but that on-farm outcomes varied, with some farmers experiencing yield losses and others gains upward of 60% (Vaughan et al., 2019a). Other studies express concern that large climate service projects have run for decades at significant expense, without adequate evaluation (Gerlak et al., 2020)."

Elements of this governance include the arrangements by which those parties engage with each other (Vaughan et al., 2016; Daniels et al., 2020) and the financial arrangements, and associated responsibilities, which support the service (Lourenço et al., 2015; Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019). Though governance varies by context, evidence suggests that engaging a range of experts and potential users in the co-design and co-production of climate services increases the use and utility of services (Lemos et al., 2014; Pope et al., 2017; Masuda et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2019b). However, some studies warn that, even with broad and inclusive participation, power differentials can create barriers to co-production, reducing the usefulness of information products (Alexander et al., 2020) and the neglect of non-meteorological sources of information which may also possess useful predictive power (Coughlan de Perez et al., 2019)."

While the commercialisation of climate services holds significant promise that more and more specifically targeted services will be provided, there is not yet agreement on which business models best support this in different contexts. There is also concern that commercialisation of climate services may disadvantage under-resourced actors at the expense of wealthier or more powerful ones (Webber, 2017; Webber and Donner, 2017; Cortekar et al., 2020).

Global social movements play an important role in raising public awareness of climate urgency (Thackeray et al., 2020). Climate change concern plays an important role in decision-making outcomes which entail public participation (Lammel, 2015; Chiang, 2018; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019; Arıkan and Günay, 2020). Nonetheless, public risk perception varies sharply on spatial and temporal scales, reflecting environmental changes, social influences (Kousser and Tranter, 2018; Rousseau and Deschacht, 2020), economic capacities (Arıkan and Günay, 2020) and culture (Noll et al., 2020), as well as individual characteristics (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). The importance of values and norms is demonstrated by recent research which highlights how intrinsic motivation (altruistic, self-transcendental and eco-centric values) (Corner et al., 2014; Braito et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2019; Bouman et al., 2020) and extrinsic social motivation (e.g., economic gains and social desirability) (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) can drive action."

Knowledge and awareness of climate change are correlated with the motivation to undertake action on climate change (Hornsey and Fielding, 2017). The integration of climate science in educational curricula has been shown to be effective (Hess and Maki, 2019; Molthan-Hill et al., 2019), including approaches such as integration of the complex system approach (Jacobson et al., 2017), experiential climate change education (Siegner, 2018), including climate games (O’Garra et al., 2021; Pfirman et al., 2021), massive open online courses and informal science learning centres (Geiger et al., 2017)."

The interventions to promote behavioural change can be bottom-up, initiated by individuals, communities, non-governmental organisations or the private sector, or top-down, coming from governments at various levels (Robertson and Barling, 2015; Stern et al., 2016). They are supported by a number of mechanisms, including education, information strategies, and campaigns, financial incentives, regulatory processes and legislation (Rosenow et al., 2017; Creutzig et al., 2018; Carlsson et al., 2019).

This shift is a result of the recognition of benefits which a co-production approach can offer, in addition to the provision of information; these additional benefits include building confidence, capacities, learning, knowledge, social capital, institutional capacity, stakeholder relationships, social networks, beneficial management practices and strengthened institutions (Bruno Soares and Dessai, 2016; Djenontin and Meadow, 2018; Bremer et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 in WGI AR6, ‘Climate information for climate services’, shows that users are widely distributed across civil society. Relevant users of climate services include humanitarian organisations (Coughlan de Perez and Mason, 2014; Harvey et al., 2019b), government offices (Mahon et al., 2019), international agencies (Perkins and Nachmany, 2019) and the private sector (Beckett, 2016; Hudson et al., 2019). Climate services currently exist at local, national, regional and international scales, at time scales which range from sub-seasonal to decadal and longer (White et al., 2017; Hewitt et al., 2020) and in a range of different sectors (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019). Agriculture is the sector with the largest number of examples (Zebiak et al., 2015; Burke and Emerick, 2016; Cliffe et al., 2016; Haigh et al., 2018; Buontempo et al., 2020); others include health (Ghebreyesus et al., 2010; Ballester et al., 2016), forestry (Caurla and Lobianco, 2020), fisheries (Busch et al., 2016), disaster risk reduction (Street et al., 2019) and water resources management (van Vliet et al., 2015; Golding et al., 2019). Evaluations of the extent to which climate services are accessed, used and deliver benefits to decision makers remain in an initial stage (Perrels, 2020), though studies suggest that these contributions vary widely depending on context. A review of evaluation of weather and climate agricultural services in Africa, for instance, found that most farmers use climate services when they are available , but that on-farm outcomes varied, with some farmers experiencing yield losses and others gains upward of 60% (Vaughan et al., 2019a). Other studies express concern that large climate service projects have run for decades at significant expense, without adequate evaluation (Gerlak et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Recent reviews (Carr and Onzere, 2018; Hewitt et al., 2020) provide evidence that the use of climate services is affected by (a) the quality, reliability and skill of the climate information (Zebiak, 2019); (b) the fit, tailoring and contextualisation of that information with respect to the specific decision-making needs of particular users (Clarkson et al., 2019); (c) the mode and method by which the service is communicated (Golding et al., 2017); and (d) the characteristics of the users themselves, including the users’ access to resources that would allow them to alter their decisions based on the information provided (Clarkson et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"A related literature characterises the extent to which the development, reach and effectiveness of climate services is affected by factors that can be termed ‘climate service governance’ (Stegmaier et al., 2020). Elements of this governance include the arrangements by which those parties engage with each other (Vaughan et al., 2016; Daniels et al., 2020) and the financial arrangements, and associated responsibilities, which support the service (Lourenço et al., 2015; Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019). Though governance varies by context, evidence suggests that engaging a range of experts and potential users in the co-design and co-production of climate services increases the use and utility of services (Lemos et al., 2014; Pope et al., 2017; Masuda et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2019b). However, some studies warn that, even with broad and inclusive participation, power differentials can create barriers to co-production, reducing the usefulness of information products (Alexander et al., 2020) and the neglect of non-meteorological sources of information which may also possess useful predictive power (Coughlan de Perez et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"A small but growing number of papers consider the business models that support climate services, including, for instance, the role of open data (Iturbide et al., 2019; Chimani et al., 2020), the standards or institutional mandates by which users come to understand the credibility and legitimacy of certain services (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019), and the role of public–private partnerships (Cortekar et al., 2020). While the commercialisation of climate services holds significant promise that more and more specifically targeted services will be provided, there is not yet agreement on which business models best support this in different contexts. There is also concern that commercialisation of climate services may disadvantage under-resourced actors at the expense of wealthier or more powerful ones (Webber, 2017; Webber and Donner, 2017; Cortekar et al., 2020). It has been noted that some climate services, such as weather forecasts and early warnings, are an example of a public good, best provided by public agencies (high confidence) (Sutter, 2013; Kitchell, 2016; Hansen et al., 2018)."

An emerging area of research examines the contribution of building capacity within public and technical organisations and agencies to draw on Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Adger et al., 2017; Hochman et al., 2017; Bacud, 2018).

Stakeholder engagement in climate change risk management supports successful adaptation (Gray et al., 2014; Elsawah et al., 2015; Siders, 2017; Giordano et al., 2020). Research in psychology and related fields shows that the cognitive mechanisms by which individuals and organisations process climate information influence this capacity, motivation and engagement (Grothmann and Patt, 2005; Grothmann et al., 2013; Masud et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Takahashi et al., 2016; Hügel and Davies, 2020; Grothmann and Michel, 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The perception of climate change as a major threat that requires action has increased since AR5, reflecting both the growth of information about climate change and the processing of that information (Lee et al., 2015; Fagan and Huang, 2019). Global social movements play an important role in raising public awareness of climate urgency (Thackeray et al., 2020). Climate change concern plays an important role in decision-making outcomes which entail public participation (Lammel, 2015; Chiang, 2018; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019; Arıkan and Günay, 2020). Nonetheless, public risk perception varies sharply on spatial and temporal scales, reflecting environmental changes, social influences (Kousser and Tranter, 2018; Rousseau and Deschacht, 2020), economic capacities (Arıkan and Günay, 2020) and culture (Noll et al., 2020), as well as individual characteristics (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). The importance of values and norms is demonstrated by recent research which highlights how intrinsic motivation (altruistic, self-transcendental and eco-centric values) (Corner et al., 2014; Braito et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2019; Bouman et al., 2020) and extrinsic social motivation (e.g., economic gains and social desirability) (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) can drive action."
wg2_ch17_17.4.4.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Recent research shows the importance of education as a predictor of risk perception, motivation and action. Education level is the strongest predictor of public awareness of climate change risk in a study across 119 countries of public awareness of climate change risk (Lee, 2015), though this relationship varies in different nations, and is influenced by mediating variables (Muttarak and Chankrajang, 2015; Blennow et al., 2016) (Ballew et al., 2020). Knowledge and awareness of climate change are correlated with the motivation to undertake action on climate change (Hornsey and Fielding, 2017). The integration of climate science in educational curricula has been shown to be effective (Hess and Maki, 2019; Molthan-Hill et al., 2019), including approaches such as integration of the complex system approach (Jacobson et al., 2017), experiential climate change education (Siegner, 2018), including climate games (O’Garra et al., 2021; Pfirman et al., 2021), massive open online courses and informal science learning centres (Geiger et al., 2017)."

The interventions to promote behavioural change can be bottom-up, initiated by individuals, communities, non-governmental organisations or the private sector, or top-down, coming from governments at various levels (Robertson and Barling, 2015; Stern et al., 2016). They are supported by a number of mechanisms, including education, information strategies, and campaigns, financial incentives, regulatory processes and legislation (Rosenow et al., 2017; Creutzig et al., 2018; Carlsson et al., 2019). These behavioural changes contribute significantly to effective risk management."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5_p1,17.4.5.1 Urgency ,"A clear difference between enabling conditions and catalysing conditions is emerging in the climate mitigation literature (Hermwille et al., 2019; Michaelowa et al., 2021), with some examples in the adaptation literature as well (Madsen et al., 2019; Booysen et al., 2019a; Bolorinos et al., 2020). Though enabling conditions are necessary pre-conditions that allow response options to be formulated and implemented, their presence alone does not guarantee that these response options will occur in a timely fashion or at a scale commensurate with the risk, or even that they will occur at all. Catalysing conditions address this deficit in advancing action. They serve to overcome the inertia that often operates as a barrier to action and motivate individuals and organisations to initiate or accelerate action. Different forms of catalysing conditions, described below, lead individuals and organisations to weigh more seriously the costs of delaying action or keeping action at low levels. Catalysing conditions focus the attention of individuals and organisations on particular risks, leading actors to augment their decision-making processes and to allocate financial and social resources to respond to those risks. This attention and deliberation can lead to more frequent and potentially substantial adaptations, whether through more extensive action on existing forms of adaptation or through the adoption of entirely new adaptations (Bolorinos et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5_p2,17.4.5.1 Urgency ,"The first two catalysing conditions described below address the costs of delaying action. Urgency increases the awareness of individuals and organisations of such costs, while windows of opportunity, including extreme events, are time-bound periods during which certain actions are possible, but after which they are more difficult or impossible. The other two conditions stimulate new forms or levels of action by promoting or directing step changes from one policy or management regime to another (Solecki et al., 2017). Litigation over adaptation issues, for example, can open new lines of action or close off old ones, while catalysing agents advance action through a variety of means (e.g., communicating the urgency of climate action, revising agendas for action, expanding coalitions which undertake action). As detailed below, these four catalysing conditions can operate together as well as separately to promote more prompt and extensive adaptations."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Urgency can catalyse action for individuals and organisations. A moderate level of urgency serves as an important driver of climate action, but both high and low levels of urgency impede response (high confidence). Wilson and Orlove (2021) review 5 experimental and 20 observational papers that examine the relationship between urgency and levels of response in climate decision-making, across a range of settings: from individuals and households to communities, managed ecosystems, sub-national regions and international river basin. Urgency in the papers is defined primarily through objective and subjective time pressure, including the recognition of the costs of delaying action and the importance of using windows of opportunity during which new forms and higher levels of response are possible. All the experimental papers and all but three of the observational papers provide support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between urgency and response intensity (including motivation and action), with higher levels of response at intermediate levels of urgency and lower levels of response at low or high levels of urgency (Figure 17.9). The general shape of this relationship also is supported for other decision domains by a well-established line of research within psychology (Heitz, 2014; Zakay, 2014; Prem et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The synthesis of the studies on urgency offers two central lessons for policymakers, community groups and others involved in addressing climate change. First, greater levels of response to climate change-induced challenges can be motivated by communication strategies that move decision makers from low to moderate levels of urgency (high confidence). In the case of drought, a number of studies show that urgent messages promote water conservation, especially when these messages are repeated, perceived as trustworthy and linked to concrete suggestions for action (Gonzales and Ajami, 2017; Joubert and Ziervogel, 2019 ; Kam et al., 2019; Booysen et al., 2019a; Booysen et al., 2019b; Bolorinos et al., 2020). These effects are also demonstrated in experimental studies of adaptation planning in contexts including European flood preparations (Madsen et al., 2019; Pot et al., 2019) and Pacific Island coastal planning (Donner and Webber, 2014)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Second, very high levels of urgency are a barrier to effective action (medium confidence) because last-minute actions to reduce risk during crises can create haste and panic, often leading to insufficient deliberation. In these cases, decision makers fail to consider a full range of alternative actions, make rash choices and poorly mobilise available resources (Asfaw et al., 2019; Robins, 2019; Gee, 2020). Given that climate decision makers in many regions and sectors are experiencing greater pressure to act, this finding suggests the existence of windows for planning and action during which climate risks have led to moderate levels of urgency, but before these risks have resulted in urgency exceeding some upper threshold (Section 17.4.5.2)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"In addition, these studies point to potential weaknesses as well as strengths in strategic communication to modulate urgency. Such messages may instead lead to lower levels of response if they induce very high levels of urgency (Asfaw et al., 2019), though this effect may be somewhat mitigated by messages that simultaneously increase recipients’ sense of self-efficacy or they are experienced in the specific risk domain discussed in the messages (Bodin et al., 2019). Future research on the relationships between urgency and effective risk management could help refine the measurement of urgency, how the relationship varies in different contexts, the role of different forms of messaging about urgency and action (Fesenfeld and Rinscheid, 2021), and the effects of urgency on decision-making by high-level decision makers within polities and by climate social movements."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Windows of opportunity are time-bounded periods during which conditions are present for advancing and often accelerating climate adaptation strategies. They can act as significant catalysing conditions for climate action and are connected to a range of possible outcomes from small incremental shifts to larger-scale more profound transformation adaptations (Novalia and Malekpour, 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Windows can open because of extreme weather events (Birkmann and Fernando, 2008), political shifts, such as new institutions, new laws and regulations, and presence of a new policy entrepreneur or new policies (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Bell and Morrison, 2015), relevant and achievable policy goals, and emergence of new knowledge (Abunnasr et al., 2013), and close after the initial causes recede and become less efficacious. They also serve as focusing events whereby a coalition of groups address specific policy questions or response options (Rudel, 2019). Recognising that windows of opportunity often catalyse action does not mean that action outside such windows is insignificant or impossible."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Extreme events such as disasters often act as proximate drivers of windows of opportunity (Birkmann and Fernando, 2008; McSweeney and Coomes, 2011). Climate disasters in a specific location become significant windows for new debate, policymaking and financing (McSweeney and Coomes, 2011). Extreme events also can facilitate change at locations distant from the most impacted site when remote actors gain perspective on their own risks (Friedman et al., 2019; Solecki et al., 2019). Factors that facilitate extreme events driving proactive as opposed to reactive responses include access to relevant risk and vulnerability data, pre-existing experience with similar events, and appropriate governance (Brown et al., 2017a). Page and Dilling (2020) find that worldview or ideology plays a central role in sense-making and in shaping what organisational decision makers ‘see’ in terms of acceptable actions in response to an extreme event."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Significant variation is present across the mix and intensity of conditions that promote action through a window of opportunity. Capacity to respond to is a function of the presence of enabling conditions as well as tools and methods to aid decision-making (Shi et al., 2015).

The SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018a) reported, with high confidence, that litigation risks of government and business had increased, and the SRCCL (IPCC, 2019b) noted that recent developments in climate attribution improve the ability to detect human influence on climate and broaden liability."

Litigation cases on adaptation and loss and damage account for about one-third of those covered in the literature (Setzer and Vanhala, 2019). Reasons for this growth are: (i) the growing gap between projected climate change impacts and current adaptation efforts (Stezer and Byrnes, 2019) and (ii) expanded legal duty of government, business and others to manage foreseeable harms (Marjanac and Patton, 2018). Climate change litigation is expanding geographically into the Americas, Asia (and the Pacific region) and Europe, with several cases brought in low- and middle-income countries (Stezer and Byrnes, 2019) (Table 17.6)."

Agents include individuals, organisations or collectives, or multiple organisations linked together."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Recent studies of climate-related social movements show that they can act as catalysing agents which promote action to manage climate-related risks (medium confidence). However, these studies use varying definitions of climate movements within the broader context of environmental movements. A prominent topic of research is the rapidity and the large scale of the proliferation of these movements around the world, primarily in urban settings but also in rural and Indigenous contexts (Claeys and Delgado Pugley, 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"These movements usually focus on climate mitigation but sometimes include adaptation. Their social bases include groups which had not previously been active in climate politics, notably children and youth, as well as sectors with long traditions of environmental activism, such as women and Indigenous Peoples (see Cross-Chapter Boxes GENDER and INDIG in Chapter 18). Much of the literature on youth movements traces the emergence of the movements themselves (Sanson et al., 2019; Treichel, 2020), their framings of climate change as a social justice issue (Holmberg and Alvinius, 2019) and their presence in demonstrations and on social media (Boulianne et al., 2020). Climate action catalysed by youth and other climate movements include visible international events such as the signing of Declaration on Children, Youth, and Climate Action at COP25 in Madrid 2019 (Han and Ahn, 2020), as well as national efforts, including lawsuits, and local events such as in tree-planting and waste reduction initiatives (Bandura and Cherry, 2019)."

Of these environmental mobilisations, 17% are directly related to climate and energy, and others are related to climate-sensitive issues (15% for biomass and land use, 14% for water management). This study reports the proportion of positive outcomes for different strategies, defined as meeting the goals of the movements, which generally align with climate adaptation and sustainable resource management. These rates vary from 10% for negotiated solutions to 34% for court decisions. It notes the corresponding higher rates of failure, as well as the costs borne by the movements, which include criminalisation (20% of cases), violence (18%) and assassination (13%). These costs are significantly higher for Indigenous communities that engage in these mobilisations."

At national and local scales, one review of US cases reports limited effectiveness of climate movements because of the ability of governmental agencies to co-opt them (Pulido et al., 2016), while another review in Pakistan shows a number of successes, because the movements were able to build alliances with other public sector and community groups (Shawoo and McDermott, 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Policy leaders, often described as policy entrepreneurs within the scholarly literature, are individuals in positions of leadership who set agendas and build coalitions to drive decision-making processes, and hence can function as catalysers of climate adaptation (Petridou and Mintrom, 2020). Political leaders who have taken on climate change as a key policy issue function as policy entrepreneurs at international, national and sub-national levels. City officials, including mayors and other executives, often play the role of climate policy entrepreneurs, while the absence of effective leadership negatively affects adaptation success (Becker and Kretsch, 2019). Such entrepreneurs can be important forces for change in both reactive contexts following an extreme or focusing event and in proactive context. They can be effective especially in contexts where they navigate and link together formal and informal networks of complex climate governance systems (Tanner et al., 2019). Their capacity to act has been increased when they and their institutions are embedded within partnership networks (Bellinson and Chu, 2019). It is in these contexts that the leadership and position of a policy entrepreneur becomes even more catalytic when operating at the interface of formal and informal networks (Mintrom, 2019; Stone, 2019)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.4.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Sub-national actors and city officials including mayors and other executives are among the individuals most often described and assessed as climate policy entrepreneurs (Kalafatis and Lemos, 2017). City-level climate policy entrepreneurs often operate using their own experience, connections and persistence to address issues of importance to their constituency. Climate risk concerns are often inherently local, and in turn local decision makers perceive it as being appropriate to engage. Conversely, the absence of effective leadership negatively affects adaptation success (Kalafatis and Lemos, 2017; Becker and Kretsch, 2019). Urban climate policy entrepreneurs operate in four key spheres of policy development and implementation: attention and support seeking strategies; linking strategies (e.g., coalition building); relational management strategies (e.g., networking and trusting building); and arena strategies including timing (Brouwer and Huitema, 2018). The presence and operation of urban climate policy entrepreneurs is positively associated in settings with multiple jurisdictions and across differing spatial scales (Kalafatis and Lemos, 2017; Renner and Meijerink, 2018). It is in these contexts that their capacity to operate simultaneously at the interface of multiple networks is particularly valuable for promoting climate action. Urban climate policy entrepreneurs can directly engage with a range of constituent groups and offer and promote climate adaptation strategies that can have direct impact on the daily lives of these residents and their interests."

Wilson and Orlove (2021) review 5 experimental and 20 observational papers that examine the relationship between urgency and levels of response in climate decision-making, across a range of settings: from individuals and households to communities, managed ecosystems, sub-national regions and international river basin. Urgency in the papers is defined primarily through objective and subjective time pressure, including the recognition of the costs of delaying action and the importance of using windows of opportunity during which new forms and higher levels of response are possible. All the experimental papers and all but three of the observational papers provide support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between urgency and response intensity (including motivation and action), with higher levels of response at intermediate levels of urgency and lower levels of response at low or high levels of urgency (Figure 17.9). The general shape of this relationship also is supported for other decision domains by a well-established line of research within psychology (Heitz, 2014; Zakay, 2014; Prem et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The synthesis of the studies on urgency offers two central lessons for policymakers, community groups and others involved in addressing climate change. First, greater levels of response to climate change-induced challenges can be motivated by communication strategies that move decision makers from low to moderate levels of urgency (high confidence). In the case of drought, a number of studies show that urgent messages promote water conservation, especially when these messages are repeated, perceived as trustworthy and linked to concrete suggestions for action (Gonzales and Ajami, 2017; Joubert and Ziervogel, 2019 ; Kam et al., 2019; Booysen et al., 2019a; Booysen et al., 2019b; Bolorinos et al., 2020). These effects are also demonstrated in experimental studies of adaptation planning in contexts including European flood preparations (Madsen et al., 2019; Pot et al., 2019) and Pacific Island coastal planning (Donner and Webber, 2014)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Second, very high levels of urgency are a barrier to effective action (medium confidence) because last-minute actions to reduce risk during crises can create haste and panic, often leading to insufficient deliberation. In these cases, decision makers fail to consider a full range of alternative actions, make rash choices and poorly mobilise available resources (Asfaw et al., 2019; Robins, 2019; Gee, 2020). Given that climate decision makers in many regions and sectors are experiencing greater pressure to act, this finding suggests the existence of windows for planning and action during which climate risks have led to moderate levels of urgency, but before these risks have resulted in urgency exceeding some upper threshold (Section 17.4.5.2)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"In addition, these studies point to potential weaknesses as well as strengths in strategic communication to modulate urgency. Such messages may instead lead to lower levels of response if they induce very high levels of urgency (Asfaw et al., 2019), though this effect may be somewhat mitigated by messages that simultaneously increase recipients’ sense of self-efficacy or they are experienced in the specific risk domain discussed in the messages (Bodin et al., 2019). Future research on the relationships between urgency and effective risk management could help refine the measurement of urgency, how the relationship varies in different contexts, the role of different forms of messaging about urgency and action (Fesenfeld and Rinscheid, 2021), and the effects of urgency on decision-making by high-level decision makers within polities and by climate social movements."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Windows of opportunity are time-bounded periods during which conditions are present for advancing and often accelerating climate adaptation strategies. They can act as significant catalysing conditions for climate action and are connected to a range of possible outcomes from small incremental shifts to larger-scale more profound transformation adaptations (Novalia and Malekpour, 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.4.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Windows can open because of extreme weather events (Birkmann and Fernando, 2008), political shifts, such as new institutions, new laws and regulations, and presence of a new policy entrepreneur or new policies (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Bell and Morrison, 2015), relevant and achievable policy goals, and emergence of new knowledge (Abunnasr et al., 2013), and close after the initial causes recede and become less efficacious. They also serve as focusing events whereby a coalition of groups address specific policy questions or response options (Rudel, 2019).

Climate disasters in a specific location become significant windows for new debate, policymaking and financing (McSweeney and Coomes, 2011). Extreme events also can facilitate change at locations distant from the most impacted site when remote actors gain perspective on their own risks (Friedman et al., 2019; Solecki et al., 2019). Factors that facilitate extreme events driving proactive as opposed to reactive responses include access to relevant risk and vulnerability data, pre-existing experience with similar events, and appropriate governance (Brown et al., 2017a). Page and Dilling (2020) find that worldview or ideology plays a central role in sense-making and in shaping what organisational decision makers ‘see’ in terms of acceptable actions in response to an extreme event."

Reasons for this growth are: (i) the growing gap between projected climate change impacts and current adaptation efforts (Stezer and Byrnes, 2019) and (ii) expanded legal duty of government, business and others to manage foreseeable harms (Marjanac and Patton, 2018).

There is also a growing recognition of the observed and potential negative consequences of some adaptation interventions, often referred to as maladaptation (Juhola et al., 2016; Magnan et al., 2016; Schipper, 2020; Eriksen et al., 2021). This section advances a new framing to allow for an improved assessment of the potential positive or negative outcomes of adaptation options, therefore allowing navigation of the adaptation–maladaptation continuum."
wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The highly contextual nature of adaptation, a multitude of applied definitions of adaptation (e.g., cost effectiveness versus outcomes), its overlaps with development interventions, and the long time horizons over which outcomes accrue, deter a universal definition of adaptation success (Dilling et al., 2019; Section 17.5.1.2; Owen, 2020; Singh et al., 2021). Moser and Boykoff (2013), Olazabal et al. (2019b) and Sherman and Ford (2013) suggest criteria against which successful adaptation could potentially be tracked. The literature is converging to suggest that successful adaptation broadly refers to actions and policies that effectively and substantially reduce climate vulnerability, and exposure to and/or impacts of climate risk (Noble et al., 2014; Juhola et al., 2016), while creating synergies to other climate-related goals, increasing benefits to non-climate-related goals (such as current and future economic, societal and other environmental goals) and minimise trade-offs (Grafakos et al., 2019) across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values (Eriksen et al., 2015; Gajjar et al., 2019a; Owen, 2020) (high confidence)."

Conceptually, maladaptation differs from ‘failed’ or ‘unsuccessful’ adaptation (Schipper, 2020), which ‘describes a failed adaptation initiative not producing any significant detrimental effect’ (Magnan et al., 2016: 648). Several frameworks have been proposed to explain and better assess maladaptation (Hallegatte, 2009; Barnett and O’Neill, 2010; Magnan, 2014; Magnan et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2019b). To limit the risk of maladaptation, a common focus of these frameworks is on intentionally avoiding negative consequences of adaptation interventions, anticipating detrimental lock-ins and path dependence, and minimising spatio-temporal trade-offs/ dis-benefits."

Importantly, the outcome of the assessment, and consequently location of a given adaptation option along this continuum, is dynamic, depending on multiple components, including changes in the characteristics of climate hazards and the effects of iterative risk management.

This is also shown by the wide confidence ranges of most options (right panel) signifying that most adaptation can be done in a way that involves a higher or a lower risk of maladaptation (medium confidence; see also Figure 17.3). The option of ‘coastal infrastructure’ signifies the highest risk for maladaptation. While it can be an efficient adaptation option in highly densely populated areas (Oppenheimer et al., 2019; CCP2.3), it has potential trade-offs for natural system functioning and human vulnerability over time. The options most widely associated with successful adaptation are ‘nature restoration’, ‘social safety nets’, ‘change of farm/fishery practice’ and ‘change of diets/reducing food waste’ (high confidence)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Some options show the dominant influence of certain criteria (Figure 17.11, central panel rows). For example, ‘availability of health infrastructure’ and ‘access to health care’ are dominated by the criterion ‘greenhouse gas emissions’. Similarly, ‘spatial planning’ carries a high risk of disadvantages to marginalised ethnic and low-income groups. This means that these adaptations could be transformed into successful adaptations more easily than others, if attention is paid to the dominant criterion. For example, if health care could be provided with low GHG emissions, it would move closer towards successful adaptation (high confidence). For other options, the criteria’s influence is more evenly distributed, as illustrated for the ‘diversification of livelihoods’ and the three options to address climate risks to peace and mobility, denoting multiple entry points to reduce the risk of maladaptive outcomes for these options."

On the contrary, most evaluated adaptation options are widely applicable across populations (benefits to humans) and deliver ecosystem services, while some also respect gender equity (largest number of small bubbles across options).

This leads to findings for general situations, potentially obscuring critical contextual specificities which can mediate successful adaptation or maladaptation outcomes. In a certain context, Figure 17.11 will appear different. Moreover, the analysis is based on a static interpretation of adaptation outcomes, while risk and risk reduction are dynamic. The current, underlying literature does not help understanding the temporal dimension of the options, their flexibility or risk of lock-in, and related potential contribution to long-term maladaptation or successful adaptation. The added value of the analysis lies in the approach to assess the potential contribution to maladaptation or successful adaptation (via the seven criteria at the top of the figure), rather than in the final results themselves. This overview illustrates how, in a particular context and for particular groups of people, adaptation options and their location on the adaptation–maladaptation continuum can be assessed for a set of outcome dimensions, focusing on assessing potential contributions per and across criteria as well as per and across options (critical information to support the identification of adaptation pathways; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter)."

Moser and Boykoff (2013), Olazabal et al. (2019b) and Sherman and Ford (2013) suggest criteria against which successful adaptation could potentially be tracked. The literature is converging to suggest that successful adaptation broadly refers to actions and policies that effectively and substantially reduce climate vulnerability, and exposure to and/or impacts of climate risk (Noble et al., 2014; Juhola et al., 2016), while creating synergies to other climate-related goals, increasing benefits to non-climate-related goals (such as current and future economic, societal and other environmental goals) and minimise trade-offs (Grafakos et al., 2019) across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values (Eriksen et al., 2015; Gajjar et al., 2019a; Owen, 2020) (high confidence)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Maladaptation refers to current or potential negative consequences of adaptation-related responses that lead to an increase in the climate vulnerability of a system, sector or group (Barnett and O’Neill, 2010) by exacerbating or shifting vulnerability or exposure now or in the future (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014; Noble et al., 2014; Juhola et al., 2016; Magnan et al., 2020) and eroding sustainable development (Juhola et al., 2016). Conceptually, maladaptation differs from ‘failed’ or ‘unsuccessful’ adaptation (Schipper, 2020), which ‘describes a failed adaptation initiative not producing any significant detrimental effect’ (Magnan et al., 2016: 648). Several frameworks have been proposed to explain and better assess maladaptation (Hallegatte, 2009; Barnett and O’Neill, 2010; Magnan, 2014; Magnan et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2019b). To limit the risk of maladaptation, a common focus of these frameworks is on intentionally avoiding negative consequences of adaptation interventions, anticipating detrimental lock-ins and path dependence, and minimising spatio-temporal trade-offs/ dis-benefits."

wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Along the adaptation–maladaptation continuum, adaptation options can score high or low on different outcome criteria identified in this section such as: benefits to the number of people, benefits to ecosystem services, equity outcomes (for marginalised ethnic groups, gender, low-income populations), transformational potential and contribution to GHG emission reduction (see SM 17.1 for full descriptions). Importantly, the outcome of the assessment, and consequently location of a given adaptation option along this continuum, is dynamic, depending on multiple components, including changes in the characteristics of climate hazards and the effects of iterative risk management. Unfortunately, this temporal dimension is understudied in the literature (including studying thresholds or speed), preventing advances on this specific point."

wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"According to an assessment (Figure 17.11; see SM 17.1 for full descriptions) of maladaptation-relevant outcome dimensions, here called criteria, that is, benefits to people, benefits to ecosystem services, benefits to equity (marginalised ethnic groups, gender, low-income populations), transformational potential and contribution to GHG emission reduction, no option is located at one or the other end of the adaptation-maladaptation continuum (Figure 17.11, right panel), showing that all options have some maladaptation potential, that is, trade-offs (very high confidence). This is also shown by the wide confidence ranges of most options (right panel) signifying that most adaptation can be done in a way that involves a higher or a lower risk of maladaptation (medium confidence; see also Figure 17.3). The option of ‘coastal infrastructure’ signifies the highest risk for maladaptation. While it can be an efficient adaptation option in highly densely populated areas (Oppenheimer et al., 2019; CCP2.3), it has potential trade-offs for natural system functioning and human vulnerability over time. The options most widely associated with successful adaptation are ‘nature restoration’, ‘social safety nets’, ‘change of farm/fishery practice’ and ‘change of diets/reducing food waste’ (high confidence)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Some options show the dominant influence of certain criteria (Figure 17.11, central panel rows). For example, ‘availability of health infrastructure’ and ‘access to health care’ are dominated by the criterion ‘greenhouse gas emissions’. Similarly, ‘spatial planning’ carries a high risk of disadvantages to marginalised ethnic and low-income groups. This means that these adaptations could be transformed into successful adaptations more easily than others, if attention is paid to the dominant criterion. For example, if health care could be provided with low GHG emissions, it would move closer towards successful adaptation (high confidence). For other options, the criteria’s influence is more evenly distributed, as illustrated for the ‘diversification of livelihoods’ and the three options to address climate risks to peace and mobility, denoting multiple entry points to reduce the risk of maladaptive outcomes for these options."
wg2_ch17_17.5.1.1.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Some criteria score highly across a number of options (Figure 17.11, central panel columns), showing that many adaptations do not pay attention to different trade-offs.

On the contrary, most evaluated adaptation options are widely applicable across populations (benefits to humans) and deliver ecosystem services, while some also respect gender equity (largest number of small bubbles across options). Through these criteria, a number of adaptation options contribute to a higher potential for successful adaptation (high confidence)."

This leads to findings for general situations, potentially obscuring critical contextual specificities which can mediate successful adaptation or maladaptation outcomes. In a certain context, Figure 17.11 will appear different. Moreover, the analysis is based on a static interpretation of adaptation outcomes, while risk and risk reduction are dynamic. The current, underlying literature does not help understanding the temporal dimension of the options, their flexibility or risk of lock-in, and related potential contribution to long-term maladaptation or successful adaptation. The added value of the analysis lies in the approach to assess the potential contribution to maladaptation or successful adaptation (via the seven criteria at the top of the figure), rather than in the final results themselves. This overview illustrates how, in a particular context and for particular groups of people, adaptation options and their location on the adaptation–maladaptation continuum can be assessed for a set of outcome dimensions, focusing on assessing potential contributions per and across criteria as well as per and across options (critical information to support the identification of adaptation pathways; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter)."

Cities are seen as locales where case examples of transformative adaptation can be examined (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018; Vermeulen et al., 2018). Cities act as testbeds of how to integrate climate response into issues of equity, health, resource allocation and sustainability in ways that utilise innovative use of new and emerging decision-support tools, methods and protocols."
wg2_ch17_box-17.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Risk management has been an integral part of the community development and settlement building process. Three key sets of drivers influence risk management decision-making in cities (Solecki et al., 2017). These include: (1) root, that is, cultural norms and social traditions; (2) context, that is, policy and governance conditions; and (3) proximate, that is, extreme events. Settlements have developed informal and formal strategies, including climate protection levels, to respond to local conditions of climate risk and hazards. In formal contexts, these strategies are contextualised in local climate change action plans (Araos et al., 2016a; Stults and Woodruff, 2017; Reckien et al., 2018a; Singh et al., 2021) and defined around a set of evaluation tools and methods and building codes, standards and regulations (see discussion in Section 17.4.4)."

These changes can be adjustments of existing policies or transitions to a new policy for current (i.e., conditions already experienced by getting worse) or emerging risks (i.e., conditions not previously or widely experienced but now increasingly present)."
wg2_ch17_box-17.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"With increasing impacts of climate change, settlements of all sizes are considering how to make their communities more resilient to climate risk (see Cross-Working Group Box URBAN in Chapter 6; Araos et al., 2016a; Araos et al., 2017; Reckien et al., 2018a). In many settlements, demands for heightened resiliency are being coupled with opportunities to enhance the social and economic equity and quality of life of residents. Transformational adaptation (transformational, as being outcome-oriented; Vermeulen et al., 2018) and associated adjustments to the urban risk management decision-making require an integration of climate resiliency pathways and conditions of sustainable development (Mendizabal et al., 2018). At the same time, growing conflict is present between requirements for greater resiliency and continued economic development, in particular in low-income environments (Ahenkan et al., 2020). Cities and their residents have the capacity to transform their own governance and decision-making systems (Birkmann et al., 2014; Chu, 2018; Romero-Lankao et al., 2018). Furthermore, cities have recognised the opportunity and demand to transform in order to be more ambitious (Mendizabal et al., 2018) and more successful, more equitable (Reckien et al., 2018b) and better able to connect the climate action to the sustainable development process (Singh et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch17_box-17.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"In some cases, transformational adaptation is associated with large-scale, top-down, formal decision processes leading to significant policy shifts. For coastal cities, this might include actions to build massive flood protection systems (as opposed to simple increase of existing structures) (Albers et al., 2015; Hinkel et al., 2018; Ajibade, 2019; see also Section 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Paper 2) or policies to encourage managed retreat from increasing at risk locations (Hino et al., 2017; Rulleau and Rey-Valette, 2017). In more extreme instances, the relocation of cities is presented as a possibility, such as planned for the city of Jakarta (Garschagen et al., 2018b). However, acceptability of top-down approaches to relocation are usually low, and bottom-up drivers of relocation are important, especially to avoid inequitable outcomes (Mach and Siders, 2021). Intensity of extreme events and changing risk perceptions and expectations of property prices have been identified as important behavioural drivers of voluntary relocation (de Koning et al., 2019; de Koning and Filatova, 2020). Yet, when not supported by equitable public adaptation policies, the transformational adaptation left to the influence of autonomous adaptation and market institutions alone leads to climate gentrification low-income households are priced out from the hazard-free zones (de Koning and Filatova, 2020)."
wg2_ch17_box-17.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"These circumstances also have revealed potential advances in decision-making by encouraging greater participation, more effective generation and use of information and data, and more prominent inclusion of questions of social and economic equity (Ziervogel et al., 2017; Reckien et al., 2018b; Solecki et al., In Press). Adaptation planning and decision-making, in general, within cities has increasingly focused on actively engaging residents in participatory and neighbourhood scale co-production processes (Broto et al., 2015; Sarzynski, 2015; Wamsler, 2017; Foster et al., 2019). However, engaging residents in risk management and adaptation has not always led to transformative decision-making and resiliency, but can at times also reinforce existing maladaptive systems (D’Alisa and Kallis, 2016)."

Linking to social data on individual decisions, risk perceptions, social norms and governmental policy, advanced social models trace and quantify how adaptation in cities evolve and would cumulatively induce transformational change. Although wider application of these models is outstanding, there is opportunity to simulate and learn from the integration of social and behavioural data with political and cultural norms (de Koning and Filatova, 2020)."
wg2_ch17_box-17.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Although non-urban areas could in many instances act in the same way as urban areas, the density of people, assets, infrastructure and economical values drive cities to act as testbeds, implement adaptation and strive for resiliency. Cities are showcases for the larger environmental systems of governments that also support mitigation ambition of national actors and are therefore demanding to be recognised as valuable actors in the international negotiations, highlighting their contribution in emissions reductions (Chan et al., 2015; Hale, 2016), such as in the preparation for the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement in 2023 (see Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation responses have been observed in every region and across a wide variety of sectors (Section 16.3), but little evidence exists of their outcomes in terms of climate risk reduction (high confidence) (Section 1.4.3; Ford and Berrang-Ford, 2016; Tompkins et al., 2018; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021; Eriksen et al., 2021; UNEP, 2021a). To advance on that, the Paris Agreement is encouraging countries to engage in ‘Monitoring and evaluating and learning from adaptation plans, policies, programmes and actions’ (UN, 2015, Article 7.9d). Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is the systematic process of collecting, analysing and using information to assess the progress of adaptation and evaluate its effects—for example, risk reduction outcomes, co-benefits and trade-offs—mostly during and after implementation (AR6 Glossary, Annex II). Distinctions between monitoring and evaluation typically view monitoring as a continuous process of tracking implementation and informing management to allow for corrective action including in situations of deep uncertainty (see Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter), while evaluation is described as a more comprehensive assessment of achievements, unintended effects and lessons learned carried out at certain point in time (OECD, 2002). M&E is an important part of the adaptation process (Figure 1.9). It can help to generate information on adaptation success or maladaptive outcomes."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"M&E of adaptation is undertaken for different purposes, including: (1) understanding whether responses have achieved their intended objectives and contributed to a reduction in climate risks and vulnerability or to an increase of adaptive capacity and resilience, (2) informing ongoing implementation and future responses, and (3) providing upward and downward accountability (Preston et al., 2009; UNFCCC, 2010a; Pringle, 2011; Spearman and McGray, 2011). M&E is also commonly linked to learning (Section 17.5.2.7). By continuously monitoring implementation, for example, to assess whether adaptation is on track or needs to be accelerated, M&E can aid decision-making under uncertainty. Adaptation M&E is distinct from tracking financial flows related to adaptation since financial accounting does not provide information on implementation and outcomes (Section 17.5.2.5; Adaptation Partnership, 2012; World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, 2012)."

Several frameworks and approaches have been proposed for M&E of adaptation and climate resilience (Bours et al., 2014d; Schipper and Langston, 2015; Adaptation Committee, 2016; ODI, 2016; Cai et al., 2018; Gregorowski et al., 2018), including sector-specific ones for agriculture (FAO, 2017; FAO, 2019a; FAO, 2019b), health (Ebi et al., 2018), ecosystem-based adaptation (Donatti et al., 2018; Donatti et al., 2020; GIZ, 2020) and cities (Section 6.4.6)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation M&E generally seeks to answer whether implementation is taking place and what effects it has (Figure 17.12). Accordingly, M&E can focus on the processes, activities and outputs or on their outcomes and ultimate impacts (Harley et al., 2008; Pringle, 2011; Ford et al., 2013). Most of the available guidance for the development of adaptation M&E systems is aimed at the household, local or project level (Pringle, 2011; Villanueva, 2012; Olivier et al., 2013; CARE, 2014; BRACED, 2015; Leiter, 2016; Jones, 2019b) with only limited guidance for national or cross-sectoral M&E systems (Price-Kelly et al., 2015) or frameworks that are applicable at different scales (Brooks et al., 2014). The available guidebooks take users through a series of steps which are synthesised in Figure 17.12."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The majority of adaptation M&E efforts have so far focused on processes and outputs rather than on achieved outcomes such as climate risks, vulnerability, well-being or development (Droesch et al., 2008; GIZ and Adelphi, 2017; UNDP Cambodia, 2014; Fawcett et al., 2017) (high confidenc e) or use a combination thereof (Brooks et al., 2011; Brooks et al., 2014). Newly emerging approaches include perception-based measurements and the use of data collected via mobile phones (Jones et al., 2018; Jones, 2019a), which can be collected frequently (Clare et al., 2017a; Knippenberg et al., 2019; Jones and Ballon, 2020). Such advances call into question the common reliance on ‘objective’ indicators defined from an external perspective. Instead, they suggest that multiple complementary approaches combined with higher-frequency data collection produce a more elaborate picture of the effects of adaptation and resilience responses (Jones and d’Errico, 2019; Knippenberg et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2019; Jones, 2019a; see Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter) (medium confidence)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Central to designing, monitoring and evaluating adaptation responses is outlining how activities are expected to lead to intended objectives, for example, via a theory of change (Bours et al., 2014c; Oberlack and al., 2019). Theories of change or similar change models provide a basis to decide what to measure, but more attention needs to be paid to how theories of change are constructed and who is involved (Mason and Barnes, 2007; Forsyth, 2018). Participatory approaches can support understanding how climate risks affect the respective population, how these risks interact with social and cultural processes, and how responses could most effectively address climate risks (Conway et al., 2019). Inclusive M&E systems can facilitate ownership and enhance the meaningfulness and usability of the generated information (CARE, 2014; Faulkner et al., 2015). Meaningfulness is not associated with a particular approach or method but depends on whether the chosen M&E design fits the M&E purpose and the information needs of the intended audience (Fisher et al., 2015; Leiter, 2017). Effective communication of M&E findings and feedback into decision-making processes is essential to achieve the respective M&E purpose and facilitate learning (Section 17.5.2.7)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"A set of all-purpose and globally applicable standard indicators that could comprehensively measure adaptation does not exist (high confidence) (IPCC, 2014; Leiter and Pringle, 2018). A wide variety of indicators have been used to assess adaptation and its results (CARE, 2010; Harvey et al., 2011; Lamhauge et al., 2013; Brooks et al., 2014; Hammill et al., 2014b; Mäkinen et al., 2018; HM Government, 2019). Literature has also noted unrealistic expectations of what indicators can accomplish. For instance, decisions involving competing political interests would not be adequately informed through simple indicators; and learning requires knowledge of how and why change has happened, something that indicators often do not capture (Hinkel, 2011; Bours et al., 2014b). Indicators can also become misguided incentives and might steer attention away from what matters (Leiter and Pringle, 2018; Hallegatte and Engle, 2019; Klonschinski, 2021). Surveys, scorecards, interviews and focus groups are alternative methods of gaining insights on adaptation progress (Brooks et al., 2014; Porter et al., 2015; Das, 2019; McNamara et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"The difficulties of assessing adaptation and an emphasis on short-term results have contributed to the common practice of relying on easily quantifiable indicators rather than assessing actual changes, that is, outcomes and impacts (World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, 2012; Fisher et al., 2015). In fact, indicators used by international climate funds largely measure outputs which provide little evidence of the actual effectiveness of adaptation, that is, its outcomes and impacts (GCF Independent Evaluation Unit, 2018; Leiter et al., 2019; Pauw et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Indices, the combination of multiple indicators into a single score, are common products of risk and vulnerability assessments to compare countries or other entities, often in the form of rankings or maps (Preston et al., 2011; Reckien, 2018; de Sherbinin and et al., 2019). They can indicate changes in vulnerability over time within their respective conceptualisation of vulnerability or risk. The construction of indices, including indicator selection, their weighting, normalisation and data sources, has a profound impact on their scores (Reckien, 2018). Research has consistently found large discrepancies between country vulnerability rankings (Brooks et al., 2005; Eriksen and Kelly, 2007; Leiter et al., 2017b; Visser et al., 2020). Reviews of vulnerability and resilience indices identified ‘substantial conceptual, methodological and empirical weaknesses’ (Füssel, 2010: 8) and a widespread lack of validation (Cai et al., 2018). Using countries as a unit of analysis also masks significant sub-national variation (Otto et al., 2015; Mohammadpour et al., 2019). Individual indices therefore ‘fail to convene a robust guidance for policy makers’ (Muccione et al., 2017: 4) and should not present the sole basis for policy decisions (Brooks et al., 2005; Leiter and Pringle, 2018). Due to their limitations (Singh et al., 2017), the OECD suggests that indices are primarily used for ‘initiating discussion and stimulating public interest’ (OECD, 2008: 13)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Tracking the implementation of national adaptation plans is essential for understanding their effectiveness, that is, the progress made in addressing climate risks, and can support assessing the success of adaptation and the risk of maladaptation. Over 60 countries have developed or started developing national adaptation M&E systems, although less than half are yet reporting on implementation (Leiter, 2021b; Table 17.8). Country-specific adaptation M&E systems vary considerably regarding their legal mandate, purpose, content, involved actors and types of reporting (Hammill et al., 2014a; EEA, 2015; Leiter, 2015; Leiter et al., 2017a; EEA, 2020). In most cases, they focus primarily on monitoring implementation rather than assessing outcomes, although some are linked to national climate risk or vulnerability assessments (e.g., in Germany and the UK) (EEA, 2018). At least 15 countries have published evaluations of national adaptation plans which help inform the development of successive adaptation plans or strategies (Table 17.8). Nevertheless, there is only limited empirical evidence of the ability of M&E systems to facilitate action or increase the level of ambition of revised policies. More research is needed to determine the quality of national adaptation M&E systems and how well they support the policy cycle."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Under the Paris Agreement, countries are encouraged to provide information on adaptation, including its adequacy and effectiveness (Möhner et al., 2017; Adaptation Committee, 2021). National adaptation M&E systems can inform both national as well as international reporting and contribute to the Global Stocktake (see Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter; Craft and Fisher, 2015; Leiter et al., 2017a). Guidance for and examples of national adaptation progress assessments are provided by Price-Kelly et al. (2015), Brooks et al. (2014), Brooks et al.

wg2_ch17_17.5.2.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Outcomes on risk reduction are typically expressed in ways that are specific to the respective sector or context (e.g., as agricultural yields, health benefits or reduced water stress) highlighting that ‘adaptation has no common reference metrics in the same way that tonnes of GHGs or radiative forcing values are for mitigation’ (IPCC, 2014: 856). Assessments of adaptation progress therefore need to specify what they are measuring and how they are measuring it. The way adaptation is conceptualised, for example as a continuum between successful adaptation and maladaptation (Section 17.1.1), and the way adaptation is framed, for example as a technical challenge or a political process (Juhola et al., 2011; Bassett and Fogelman, 2013; Eriksen et al., 2015), shape the understanding of progress and its subsequent measurement (Singh et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Furthermore, people can be differently affected even in the same location owing to, among others, differential vulnerability among the population (Reckien and Petkova, 2019; Thomas et al., 2019). Different views and values can also affect what it means to adapt (Few et al., 2021). Assessments of adaptation progress therefore need to be transparent and reflective about how they define and measure adaptation and account for culturally and geographic contingent concepts of what it means to adapt in light of the global diversity of livelihoods and concepts."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"The lack of knowledge on adaptation progress is associated with further measurement challenges, including that avoided impacts are difficult to measure and that risk levels change over time, meaning what is effective today may not be effective in the future (Brooks et al., 2011; Pringle, 2011; Spearman and McGray, 2011; Villanueva, 2012; Bours et al., 2014a). Moreover, adaptation is embedded in complex political and social realities where power and politics shape outcomes and where simplistic views of how adaptation would take place may be ill-conceived (Nightingale, 2017; Mikulewicz, 2018; Mikulewicz, 2020). In practice, this means that theories of change of adaptation projects may miss important causes of risks and could subsequently lead to inaccurate assessments (Forsyth, 2018). Measuring adaptation is therefore a matter of understanding drivers of vulnerability and risk and of designing responses and M&E systems accordingly (UNFCCC, 2019a, section V)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"The importance of context and the dependence on viewpoints make comparative assessments of adaptation across nations, regions or responses challenging. Comparison requires a consistent conceptualisation of adaptation, comparable units of analysis and access to relevant data sets (Ford et al., 2015; Ford and Berrang-Ford, 2016). Comparative adaptation policy assessments to date often lack clarity in concepts and explanatory variables (Dupuis and Biesbroek, 2013; Biesbroek R, 2018a). The trade-off between standardisation and context specificity also complicates attempts to aggregate adaptation progress across scales to the national or global level (Leiter and Pringle, 2018; Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation finance tracking is capturing the financial flows associated with adaptation. It can indicate how much is being spent on adaptation, where funds are going to and whether spending matches allocated budgets. Thus, adaptation finance tracking can provide useful information for decision-making, but it does not provide information on the achievements resulting from the invested funds. Accordingly, it can complement, but not substitute, M&E of actions and outcomes. Adaptation finance tracking can be applied domestically (Guzmán et al., 2017; Guzmán et al., 2018) as well as internationally, for instance by developed countries to report on the goal to mobilise USD 100 billion yr −1 by 2020 in climate finance (UNFCCC SCF, 2018). Data on adaptation finance can be used alongside information on planning and implementation to assess adaptation progress (UNEP, 2021a)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Tracking adaptation finance requires defining what counts as adaptation. Different definitions can lead to large variations in the estimated amount of adaptation finance (Donner et al., 2016; Hall, 2017). A further challenge is how to account for adaptation that is mainstreamed, that is, where adaptation-specific investments form only part of a larger programme or budget line, or where actions contribute to adaptation without being labelled as adaptation. These challenges limit the direct comparability between adaptation and mitigation finance (UNFCCC, 2019a). In fact, tracking adaptation finance differs from tracking mitigation finance since activities cannot be a priori assumed to constitute adaptation but instead have to be assessed for their linkage to climate risks in a particular context (MDBs & IDFC, 2018). Methods for adaptation finance tracking continue to be further developed aiming at better comparability and completeness (Richmond and Hallmeyer, 2019; Richmond et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"Various methods are used to track adaptation finance, which makes comparisons between adaptation finance figures challenging (UNFCCC SCF, 2018; Weikmans and Roberts, 2019). For example, multi-lateral development banks use a different methodology than countries do under the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) (Box 17.4; MDBs, 2019). One of the differences concerns the treatment of partially adaptation-relevant projects, namely whether only parts or the full amount of a given project volume are counted as adaptation finance (see, e.g., MDBs, 2019). Under the OECD DAC methodology, countries often use a fixed percentage (e.g., 50% of the total project value), whereas the MDB methodology attempts for a project-specific estimation of the adaptation-relevant proportion (MDBs & IDFC, 2018). Another aspect is whether tracking distinguishes between financial instruments, such as grants or loans. Different accounting rules can lead to large differences in reported amounts of adaptation finance and to a lack of comparability between providers (Weikmans and Roberts, 2019). Studies identified an over-reporting (i.e., counting non-adaptation-related finance) by a factor of two to three, which suggests the need for a more consistent and transparent accounting system (Weikmans et al., 2017; CARE, 2021)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"Good coverage of adaptation finance data exists around international public finance flows, predominantly official development assistance flows from OECD DAC members and from multi-lateral development banks.

Recent estimates of adaptation finance are provided in UNFCCC SCF (2018), Macquarie et al. (2020) and Cross-Chapter Box FAR in this Chapter."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Most adaptation M&E frameworks and tools proposed to date refer to monitoring rather than evaluation (high confidence) (Adaptation Committee, 2016). Evaluations are envisioned to go beyond monitoring by examining how and why results have been achieved and what could be improved (Brousselle and Buregeya, 2018; Vähämäki and Verger, 2019). Evaluations of adaptation outcomes are still rare, particularly quantitative impact evaluations (Weldegebriel and Prowse, 2013; Das, 2019; Béné et al., 2020). Impact evaluations of adaptation need to address several methodological as well as practical challenges (Dinshaw et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2015; Béné et al., 2017; Puri et al., 2020). Different types of evaluations are appropriate for different evaluation questions (Silvestrini et al., 2015). Evaluations of the available evidence of effective adaptation, in particular topics or sectors, have emerged more recently, for instance on mainstreaming (Runhaar et al., 2018) and agricultural climate services (Vaughan et al., 2019a). Impact evaluations of capacity building measures are important because capacity building is assumed to lead to adaptation, but its actual effects are seldom examined (Mortreux and Barnett, 2017; Alpizar F and Meiselman, 2019). If well designed and utilised for learning, evaluations can play an important role in improving adaptation responses (Hildén, 2011)."
wg2_ch17_17.5.2.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Learning requires information about how and why change occurred and what experiences have been made (Feinstein, 2012). M&E is frequently associated with learning, but it is rarely made explicit how learning is supposed to take place (Armitage et al., 2008; Baird et al., 2015; Borras and Hølund, 2015). The design of adaptation M&E systems can support learning by gathering relevant information and disseminating it in a way that is accessible and effectively linked to decision-making processes (Spearman and McGray, 2011; Villanueva, 2012; Fisher et al., 2015). Options include institutionalised feedback mechanisms, peer learning and knowledge sharing events, a learning culture and ways to gather in-depth insights beyond indicators (ibid; Oswald and Taylor, 2010). Since AR5, adaptation programmes and funds such as the BRACED programme, the Adaptation Fund, the Climate Investment Funds and the Green Climate Fund have created knowledge-sharing units and provide resources to support learning activities (BRACED, 2015; Roehrer and Kouadio, 2015; Adaptation Fund, 2016; Leavy et al., 2018; CIF, 2020; Puri et al., 2020), but there is little information about their longer-term effectiveness."
wg2_ch17_box-17.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) introduced a methodology to track the amount of bilateral official development assistance (ODA) that is targeting climate change mitigation and/or adaptation. It distinguishes whether activities have adaptation as a ‘principal’ objective (score ‘2’), as a ‘significant’ objective (score ‘1’) or as not targeting it (score ‘0’) (OECD, 2016). The associated project value is counted in full, in part, or not counted as adaptation finance, respectively. Countries count the volume of partial adaptation projects (score ‘1’) to a different extent, which limits comparability and can lead to over-reporting (OECD, 2019). The first data on this ‘adaptation marker’ became available in 2012 for the financial flows of 2010. It forms the basis for developed countries’ reporting to the UNFCCC Secretariat on their financial commitments towards developing countries (Weikmans and Roberts, 2019)."
wg2_ch17_box-17.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"While a guidebook with requirements for adaptation as a principle or significant objective has been developed (OECD, 2016), several studies have shown that OECD DAC donors tend to overestimate the number of activities in their portfolio that genuinely have adaptation objectives (Michaelowa and Michaelowa, 2011; Weikmans et al., 2017; CARE, 2021). Hence, the amount of adaptation finance from public sources may be lower than reported. The use of just three categories leads to a broad range of the extent of adaptation being concentrated in the middle category (‘significant objective’). Accordingly, the category ‘principle objective adaptation’ provides a more robust predictor of the relevance of an activity to adaptation (Donner et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch17_17.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Actions to ameliorate a climate risk have consequences beyond the immediate effects on exposure or vulnerability to a hazard. They may aim to combat many risks, could adversely interact with other risks and actions, or may be nested within a suite of actions across many risks. Some actions may have negative consequences for climate resilient development. In this broader context, the effectiveness of adaptations for supporting climate resilient development is now better articulated (Box 17.1). Importantly, adaptations need to be designed to not only combat current and future climate risks but also ensure that they do not lock in undesirable pathways in the future as risks develop and change (very high confidence) (Sections 17.2, 17.3.1, 17.5). Effective management of climate risks will therefore be dependent on satisfactorily managing current climate risks (Boxes 17.1, 17.2, 17.5), coupled with assessing prognoses for future climate risks, and developing responses in advance for reducing those risks to tolerable residual levels (very high confidence) (Sections 1.4, 1.6, 16.6, 17.2, Box 16.1; e.g., water risks, Section 4.7.1).

wg2_ch17_17.6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation strategies or plans, some of which incorporate elements of climate resilient development, have been developed in many jurisdictions from local (Cuevas, 2016; Araos et al., 2016a; Reckien et al., 2018a; Göpfert et al., 2019) to provincial/state (Warnken and Mosadeghi, 2018) to national governments (Markolf et al., 2015; CSIRO, 2018; Warnken and Mosadeghi, 2018; Brown et al., 2018 a; Table 17.8). National Adaptation Plans have been a requirement under the UNFCCC and establish the general approach taken by nations for adapting to climate change (Woodruff and Regan, 2019). Integrated risk assessments and adaptation processes are being developed but with much less experience evident in their implementation (high confidence) (Wise et al., 2014; Woodruff and Stults, 2016; Brown et al., 2018 a)."
wg2_ch17_17.6.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the UNFCCC have been reviewed for quality by Woodruff and Regan (2019). In their review, Woodruff and Regan used a number of indicators grouped within established ‘quality principles’. They found that the plans were more oriented at the strategic level or at the level of specific projects rather than identifying methods for resolving cross-sectoral or cross-jurisdictional interactions or issues (medium confidence). A key recommendation from their review and supported by other studies (e.g., Abutaleb et al., 2018) is that plans would be improved greatly by having inputs from multiple government agencies and multiple sectors (medium confidence), which could provide the basis for planning and review of integrated adaptation. Also, the plans need greater attention to implementation (Sections 9.4.1, 11.8, 13.11.2), and the identification of metrics by which success (Section 17.5.1) and performance can be measured (Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter), a common issue for adaptation planning generally (e.g., Sections 12.5.2.6, 17.5)."
wg2_ch17_17.6.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Hence, satisfactorily managing intersecting climate risks in different settings, of which RKRs provide examples, is central to achieving sustainable development (high confidence) (Section 16.6.4), requiring integrated risk management within and across regions, jurisdictions, sectors and ecosystems (high confidence) (see CCP5.4.2, CCP5.4.3). Iterative processes will enable measuring progress and updating adaptation at a satisfactory rate, to account for the different needs within regions and across sectors at different times (high confidence). The degree to which equity and justice will be achieved will be determined by the participatory processes in deciding on suitable adaptation options, the investment in the adaptation processes and the coordination and collaboration built among institutions and people across regions (high confidence)."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Guidelines, instruments and resources to identify options for managing risks, and support decisions on the most suitable course of actions to take, can be collectively referred to as decision-support frameworks. These can include data services, decision-support tools, processes for making decisions and methods for monitoring and evaluating progress and success. Data services enable the identification, location and timing of risks that could manifest with negative impacts, as well as potential opportunities. Often, these are termed ‘climate services’ and assist with mapping hazards and how they are changing. Decision-support tools range from qualitative approaches to determining overlap of areas of concern with those hazards in the future, to more quantitative and dynamic simulation approaches that enable dynamic stress-testing of adaptation options and strategies to determine if proposed plans for adapting to the future could be successful. An important consideration is whether options for risk management or capitalisation on opportunities will limit options and flexibility for responding to unforeseen events in the future. If these options have a negative effect on other areas of concern, then they could be identified in these planning scenarios as maladaptations, and therefore avoided."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"A great challenge for decision makers is how to choose effective options when the future is uncertain. Uncertainty can arise not just in the statistical error of the magnitude of risk but also in the nature and consequence of risk from uncertainty about mechanisms that link areas of concern to hazards, uncertainty in the decision processes themselves and so on. Methods are available to help develop no-regret options, commonly referred to as decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty’."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Decision-support frameworks are most successful when they are iterative, integrative and consultative. Rather than a single decision be made, and an action taken, there are processes for making the best decision possible, then monitoring progress towards delivering a successful outcome. Given a set of suitable indicators with regular monitoring, decisions can be revised, updated or changed as the future unfolds and foundations for the original decision tested. This is important because climate responses need to be initiated well in advance of them being needed due to the time required to implement suitable responses. These forward-looking approaches allow errors to occur and corrections made before problems arise. They also enable action to be taken without having to wait for the circumstances to arise, which if this were to occur could result in only limited reactions being available and the outcomes then dependent upon recovery from events rather than proactive planning and avoidance of events. Integrated approaches to risk management are available to help manage portfolios of interacting risks, including the potential for compounding and cascading risks when climate-related events arise."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Managing uncertainty with forward-looking processes needs to be more deliberative and oriented towards building trust in a collaborative process. Building relationships through informal, bottom-up processes enables this to occur. Top-down planning processes are important for ensuring that the management of risks and opportunities do not end up with maladaptations and that the approaches are equitable and proportional to that which is needed to manage the risks."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p1,NO_TITLE,What do we mean by ‘climate finance’?
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The UNFCCC has no formally agreed upon definition of climate finance. The current IPCC definition is: ‘the financial resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local scales, including international financial flows to developing countries to assist them in addressing climate change’ (see Annex II: Glossary)."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p3,NO_TITLE,What needs to be financed?
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Financial resources might be needed for a range of adaptation and resilience building activities. These include research, education and capacity building; development of laws, regulations and standards; provision of climate services and other information; reducing the vulnerability of existing assets, activities and services; and ensuring future development—such as new infrastructure, settlements, health services and business activities—is climate resilient. Finance is also needed to recover and rebuild from the damage of climate hazards that cannot be completely avoided through adaptation. Adaptation actions can be undertaken by many different actors, alone or in partnership, including national and sub-national governments, public and private utilities, businesses of varying size, communities, households and individuals."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p5,NO_TITLE,Table FAQ17.2.1 | Examples of adaptation and resilience activities that might need to be financed
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p7,NO_TITLE,How much finance is needed?
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"The amount of adaptation finance depends on global, regional and local factors, including: the amount and timing of global warming, and how this translates into impacts and adaptation needs across the world; the levels of adaptation already in place; the type of risk being adapted to; and the adaptation options being chosen, including whether the adaptation required is incremental or transformational."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"The most-mentioned figure for finance need is the developed countries’ commitment to provide USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries’ efforts in mitigation and adaptation. Negotiations will start in 2021 on updating this amount for 2025. While sometimes thought to represent the actual cost of responding to climate change in developing countries, this is not the case. More recent estimates of the global cost of adaptation by 2030 across developed and developing countries range between about USD 80 and 300 billion per year."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p10,NO_TITLE,What types of finance are available?
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p11,NO_TITLE,Four main types (or instruments) of finance are currently being used to support adaptation. These different types are not mutually exclusive; grants can be combined with loans to provide blended finance.
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p12,NO_TITLE,Table FAQ17.2.2 | The main instruments through which adaptation is being financed.
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p14,NO_TITLE,Where are different types of finance most useful?
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.2_p15,NO_TITLE,"Grants are useful for a range of adaptation actions where it is hard to generate a financial return. These include capacity-building activities, piloting new adaptation innovations, high-risk investment settings or projects where there are considerable non-financial benefits. In contrast, loans and other debt instruments can often support larger investments, for example for scaling out of successful pilot projects or for building adaptation and resilience into general development investment. To date, a large proportion of international climate finance for adaptation in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, has been grant led, sourced from OECD public funds, indicating that in many instances financing via loans is either considered too risky by the commercial investment sector or it has been hard to demonstrate sufficient return on investment."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"In a warming world, incremental adaptation, that is, proven standard measures of adaptation, will not always suffice to adjust to the negative impacts from climate change leading to substantial residual risks and, in some cases, the breaching of adaptation limits; transformational adaptation, involving larger system-wide change (as compared with in-system change), will increasingly be necessary as a complement for helping individuals and communities to cope with climate change. As an example of incremental adaptation, a farmer may decide to use drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. With further warming and increases in heatwaves and drought, however, the impacts of climate change may necessitate the consideration of system-wide change, such as moving to an entirely new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices, or switching to livestock rearing. Where on-site adaptation becomes infeasible and pull factors exist, the farming households may decide to seek employment in other sectors, which may also lead to migration for work. As another example, physical protection through sea walls to stop coastal flooding is a proven adaptation measure. With further projected flooding due to increasing sea level rise attributable to climate change transformational city planning, that would systemically change how flood water is managed throughout the whole city, potentially requiring deeper institutional, structural and financial support. Also, the deliberate relocation of settlements (managed retreat) is seeing attention in the face of increasingly severe coastal or riverine flooding in some regions. While transformational adaptation is increasingly being considered in theory and planning, implementation is only beginning to see attention."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"A warming climate brings along increasing risks, part of which can be reduced or insured. What remains is called residual risks and needs to be retained by households, the private and public sectors. People living in conflict-affected areas benefit only marginally from adaptation investments by governments, private sector or other institutions. These people bear most of the changing climate risks themselves. Higher-income countries generally have invested heavily in structural adaptation to make sure people are not exposed to extreme events (e.g., dykes) and have developed a variety of private or public insurance systems to finance the risk of the most rare or extreme events. In other, middle- or lower-income countries, these very extreme events are less likely to be insured, and the impacts are borne by the most vulnerable people. Absent risk reduction or insurance, coping with residual risks generally means reducing consumption (e.g., food) or drawing down assets (selling machinery, houses, etc.), which all can bring along longer-term adverse developmental implications. Adaptation investments in low-income countries tend to focus more heavily on increasing capacity and reducing vulnerability; people remain exposed to the changing climate risks and bear the burden of reacting and responding."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation aims to reduce exposure and vulnerability to climate change by responding to dynamic and multi-scalar combinations of climatic risks. What might be seen as successful at one scale or at one point in time might not be at another, particularly if climate risks continue to rise. Moreover, the benefits of adaptation interventions may not reach all intended beneficiaries or everyone affected by climate impact and risk, causing different people to have different views on how successful adaptation has been."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is, therefore, no universal way to measure adaptation success, but there is high agreement  that success is associated with a reduction of climate risks and vulnerabilities (for humans and ecosystems) and an equitable balancing of synergies and trade-offs across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values. Adaptation that is successful is also commonly expected to be inclusive of different socioeconomic groups, especially the most vulnerable, and to be based on flexible and integrative planning processes that take into account different climate scenarios."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"Conceptually, the opposite of successful adaptation is maladaptation, that is, when adaptation responses produce unintended negative side effects such as exacerbating or shifting vulnerability, increasing risk for certain people or ecosystems, or increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Among the adaptation options assessed in this report (Figure FAQ17.5.1), physical infrastructure along coasts (e.g., sea walls) has the highest risk for maladaptation over time through negative side effects on ecosystem functioning and coastal livelihood opportunities. However, such adaptations may appear valuable in the short and even longer term for already densely populated urban coasts, demonstrating that an adaptation can be differently judged based on the context it is implemented in (Figure FAQ17.5.1). Many other adaptation options have a larger potential to contribute to successful adaptation (Figure FAQ17.5.1), such as nature restoration, providing social safety nets and changing diets/minimising food waste."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Assessments of adaptation need to be transparent about how they are measuring success. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) can be used to track progress and evaluate success and to identify if course corrections during adaptation implementation are needed to achieve the envisaged objectives. Given the diversity of adaptation actions and contexts, no one-size-fits-all approach to M&E and no common reference metrics for adaptation exist. To date, assessments of progress of adaptation have often focused on processes and outputs (i.e., actions taken, such as adaptation plans adopted) that are easier to measure than the effects of these actions in terms of long-term reduction of risks and vulnerabilities. However, knowledge about the outcomes in terms of reducing climate risk, impact and vulnerability is critically required to know if adaptation has been successful."
wg2_ch17_FAQ 17.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Tracking progress, in particular outcomes and impacts of adaptation, involves a number of challenges. First, to determine progress over time, risk and vulnerability assessments need to be repeated at least once after starting an adaptation process. This is rarely done, as it demands resources that are usually not factored into the adaptation response. Second, attributing changes in climate risks and vulnerabilities to the adaptation response is often difficult due to other influencing factors, such as socioeconomic development over time. Expected causal relationships between responses and their outcomes should already be outlined during the adaptation planning phase, for example by mapping the way from activities to outcomes, and they should be monitored during implementation. Third, as adaptation can occur in multiple forms and target multiple temporal and spatial scales, the engagement of a diversity of stakeholders is vital to understanding how responses enable adaptation and adaptation success across vulnerable groups. Although stakeholder engagement can be time intensive and costly, in particular when reaching out to populations that are usually not part of policy and planning processes, it can support evaluating co-benefits and trade-offs of adaptation responses. Consideration and analysis of co-benefits and trade-offs along with a focus on short, medium and long time horizons of adaptation goals, which is usually possible through flexible and strong institutions, facilitate successful adaptation and reduce the likelihood of maladaptation."
