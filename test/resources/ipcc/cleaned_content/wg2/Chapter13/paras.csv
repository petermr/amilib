wg2_ch13_13.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This regional chapter on climate-change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptations in Europe examines the impacts on the sectors, regions and vulnerable populations of Europe, assesses the causes of vulnerability and analyses ways to adapt, thereby considering socioeconomic developments, land-use change and other non-climatic drivers. Compared with AR5 and in the context of the Paris Agreement (2015), we place emphasis on the planned and implemented solutions, assess their feasibility and effectiveness, and consider the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Global warming level (GWL) refers to global climate-change emissions relative to pre-industrial levels, expressed as global surface air temperature (Section 1.6.2; Chen et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The chapter generally follows the overall structure of AR6 WGII. We first present our point of departure (the present section) followed by the key sectors, starting with water, as water is interconnected and of fundamental importance to subsequent sections (Sections 13.2–13.8). For each section, we assess the observed impacts and projected risks, solution space and adaptation options, and knowledge gaps. The solution space is defined as the space within which opportunities and constraints determine why, how, when and who adapts to climate risks (Haasnoot et al., 2020a). Section 13.9 discusses impacts and adaptation beyond Europe, followed by the key risks for Europe (Section 13.10). The chapter ends with an assessment of the adaptation solution space, CRD pathways and SDGs (13.11), although recognising that scientific literature on these aspects is only slowly beginning to emerge."
wg2_ch13_13.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"With the rapidly growing body of scientific literature since WGII AR5 (Callaghan et al., 2020), our assessment prioritises systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and synthesis papers and reports. Feasibility and effectiveness assessments use revised methods developed for the Special Report of Global warming of 1.5°C (de Coninck et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2020). Protocols, as well as supporting material for figures and tables, can be found in the Supplementary Material."
wg2_ch13_13.1.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The geographical scope and subdivision of European land, coastal and ocean regions is largely the same as in WGII AR5 Chapter 23 (Kovats et al., 2014): Southern Europe (SEU), Western Central Europe (WCE), Eastern Europe (EEU) and Northern Europe (NEU). Note that WGI assesses a larger region for the Mediterranean (MED) which includes North Africa and the Middle East compared with the assessment in this chapter (SEU). The European part of the Arctic region is not systematically assessed here, as it is extensively captured in Cross-Chapter Paper 6. Information relevant to Europe is also synthesised in the CCPs (Cross-Chapter Papers), including European biodiversity hotspots (Cross-Chapter Paper 1), coastal cities and settlements (Cross-Chapter Paper 2), Mediterranean regions (Cross-Chapter Paper 4) and mountains (Cross-Chapter Paper 5). European seas are broadly divided by latitude into (i) European Arctic waters (NEUS), (ii) European temperate seas (TEUS) and (iii) southern seas with the Mediterranean and the Black Sea (SEUS) (Figure 13.1)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The adaptive capacity, as measured by the GDP per capita, tends to be higher in northern and western parts of Europe (Figure 13.2a). In recent decades, climate change has led to substantial losses and damages to people and assets across Europe, mostly from riverine flooding, heatwaves and storms (Figure 13.2b). Public concern about climate change, which is an indicator of the intention to mitigate and adapt, is particularly high in parts of SEU and WCE (Figure 13.2c). Current vulnerability to extreme weather and climatic events in European countries is low to moderate compared with the rest of the world (Figure 13.2d)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The main findings of previous reports, particularly the WGII AR5 (Kovats et al., 2014) and the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), highlighted the impacts of warming and rainfall variations and their extremes on Europe, particularly SEU and mountainous areas. At 2°C GWL, 9% of Europe’s population was projected to be exposed to aggravated water scarcity, and 8% of the territory of Europe were characterised to have a high or very high sensitivity to desertification (UNEP/UNECE, 2016). These impacts are driven by changes in temperature, precipitation, irrigation developments, population growth, agricultural policies and markets (EEA, 2017a). Heat is a main hazard for high-latitude ecosystems (Kovats et al., 2014; Jacob et al., 2018; Hock et al., 2019). The majority of mountain glaciers lost mass during the past two decades, and permafrost in the European Alps and Scandinavia is decreasing (Hock et al., 2019). In Central Europe, Scandinavia and Caucasus, mountain glaciers were projected to lose 60–80% of their mass by the end of the 21st century (Hock et al., 2019). The combined impacts on tourism, agriculture, forestry, energy, health and infrastructure were suggested to make SEU highly vulnerable and increase the risks of failures and vulnerability for urban areas (Kovats et al., 2014). Previous reports stated that the adaptive capacity in Europe is high compared with other regions of the world, but that there are also limits to adaptation from physical, social, economic and technological factors. Evidence suggested that staying within 1.5°C GWL would strongly increase Europe’s ability to adapt to climate change (de Coninck et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Changes in several climatic-impact drivers have already emerged in all regions of Europe: increases in mean temperature and extreme heat, and decreases in cold spells (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Lake and river ice has decreased in NEU, WCE and MED, and sea ice in NEUS (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). With increasing warming, confidence in projections is increasing for more drivers (Figure 13.3). Mean and maximum temperatures, frequencies of warm days and nights, and heatwaves have increased since 1950, while the corresponding cold indices have decreased (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Average warming will be larger than the global mean in all of Europe, with largest winter warming in NEU and EEU and largest summer warming in MED (high confidence) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). An increase in hot days and a decrease in cold days are very likely  (Figure 13.4a,b). Projections suggest a substantial reduction in European ice glacier volumes and in snow cover below elevations of 1500–2000 m, as well as further permafrost thawing and degradation, during the 21st century, even at a low GWL (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The assessment of climate change in WGI AR6 concludes that during recent decades mean precipitation has increased over NEU, WCE and EEU, while magnitude and sign of observed trends depend substantially on time period and study region in MED (medium confidence) (Douville et al., 2021; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Precipitation extremes have increased in NEU and EEU (high confidence) (Seneviratne et al., 2021), vary spatially in WCE (medium confidence) and have not changed in MED (low confidence). For >2°C GWL, of mean precipitation in NEU in winter is increasing and decreasing in MED in summer (high confidence). A widespread increase of precipitation extremes is projected for >2°C GWL for all sub-regions (high confidence), except for MED where no change or decrease is projected in some areas (Figure 13.4c,d; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). WGI assessed projections for meteorological, agricultural/ecological and hydrological drought (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) with low confidence in the direction of change in NEU, WCE and EEU at 1.5°C GWL. MED is projected to be most affected within Europe with all types of droughts increasing for 1.5°C (medium confidence) and 4°C GWL (high confidence). At 4°C GWL, hydrological droughts in NEU, WCE and EEU will increase (medium confidence). Projections for the 21st century show increases in storms across all of Europe (medium confidence) for >2°C GWL with a decrease in their frequency in the MED (Ranasinghe et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Sea surface warming between 0.25°C and 1°C has been observed in all regions over recent decades (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) and are projected to continue increasing (high confidence), particularly in the SEUS and at the NEUS (Figure 13.4g,h; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Salinity has increased in the SEUS and decreased in NEUS and is projected to continue (medium confidence) (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). European waters have been, and will continue, acidifying (virtually certain) (Eyring et al., 2021; Szopa et al., 2021), resulting in a mean decrease of surface pH of about 0.1 and 0.3 pH units at 1.5°C and 3°C GWL with the largest changes at high latitudes (Gutiérrez et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.1.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Relative sea level has risen along the European coastlines (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), regionally mitigated by post-glacial rise of land masses in Scandinavia (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). This SLR will very likely  continue to increase during the 21st century (Figure 13.4k,l) (high confidence), with regional deviations from global mean SLR (low confidence). Extreme water levels, coastal floods and sandy coastline recession are projected to increase along many European coastlines (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Almost 50 million Europeans live within 10 m above mean sea level (Vousdoukas et al., 2020; McEvoy et al., 2021). Without further adaptation (Section 13.2.2), flood risks along Europe’s low-lying coasts and estuaries will increase due to SLR compounded by storm surges, rainfall and river runoff (high confidence) (Mokrech et al., 2015; Arns et al., 2017; Sayol and Marcos, 2018; Vousdoukas et al., 2018a; Bevacqua et al., 2019; Couasnon et al., 2020). The population at risk of a 100-year flood event starts to rapidly increase beyond 2040 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018a) reaching 10 million people under RCP8.5 by 2100, but it stays just below 10 million people under RCP2.6 by 2150 (Figure 13.5; Haasnoot et al., 2021b) assuming present population and protection. The number of people at risk is projected to increase and risk to materialise earlier especially in response to increasing population under SSP5 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018a; Haasnoot et al., 2021b). Under high rates of SLR resulting from rapid ice sheet loss from Antarctica, risks may increase by a third by 2150 (Haasnoot et al., 2021b). Expected annual (direct) damages due to coastal flooding are projected to rise from 1.3 billion EUR today to 13–39 billion EUR by 2050 between 2°C and 2.5°C GWL and 93–960 billion EUR by 2100 between 2.5° and 4.4°C GWL, largely depending on socioeconomic developments (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Vousdoukas et al., 2018a) (high confidence in the sign; low confidence in the numbers). UNESCO World Heritage sites in the coastal zone are at risk due to SLR, coastal erosion and flooding (Section 13.8.1.3; Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Marzeion and Levermann, 2014; Reimann et al., 2018b) as are coastal landfills and other key infrastructures in Europe (AR6/SROCC; Brand et al., 2018; Beaven et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Observations indicate that soft cliffs and beaches are most affected by erosion in Europe with, for example, 27–40% of Europe’s sandy coast eroding today, without climate change being identified as the main driver so far (Pranzini et al., 2015; Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). SLR will increase coastal erosion of sandy shorelines (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), but there is low confidence in quantitative values assessment of erosion rates and amounts (Athanasiou et al., 2019; Le Cozannet et al., 2019; Thieblemont et al., 2019). Without nourishment or other natural or artificial barriers to erosion, sandy shorelines could retreat by about 100 m in Europe at 4°C GWL; limiting warming to 3°C GWL could reduce this value by one-third (Vousdoukas et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Precipitation has raised river flood hazards in WCE and the UK by 11% per decade from 1960 to 2010 and decreased in EEU and SEU by 23% per decade (Douville et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). The most recent three decades had the highest number of floods in the past 500 years with increases in summer (Blöschl et al., 2020). Economic flood damages increased strongly, reflecting increasing exposure of people and assets (Visser et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Merz et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Projections indicate a continuation of the observed trends of river flood hazards in WCE (high confidence) of 10% at 2°C GWL and 18% at 4.4°C GWL, and a decrease in NEU and SEU (medium confidence) with, respectively, 5 and 11% in NEU and SEU for a 100-year peak flow, making Europe one of the regions with the largest projected increase in flood risk (Di Sante et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). While there is disagreement on the magnitude of economic losses and people affected, there is high agreement  on direction of change, particularly in WCE (Alfieri et al., 2018). New research increases confidence in AR5 statements that without adaptation measures, increases in extreme rainfall will substantially increase direct flood damages (e.g., Madsen et al., 2014; Alfieri et al., 2015a; Alfieri et al., 2015b; Blöschl et al., 2017; Dottori et al., 2020; Mentaschi et al., 2020). With low adaptation, damages from river flooding are projected to be three times higher at 1.5°C GWL, four times at 2°C GWL and six times at 3°C GWL (Alfieri et al., 2018; Dottori et al., 2020). At 2°C GWL, the incidence of summer floods is expected to decrease across the whole alpine region, whereas winter and spring floods will increase due to extreme precipitation (Gobiet et al., 2014) and snowmelt-driven runoff (Coppola et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Pluvial flooding and flash floods due to intense rainfall constitute most flood events in SEU and a substantial risk in other European regions (Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Llasat et al., 2016; Rudd et al., 2020). The majority (56%) of flood events between 1860 and 2016 were flash floods (Paprotny et al., 2018a). These floods had considerable impacts including danger to human lives, for example, causing total economic damage of 1 billion USD in Copenhagen (Denmark) in 2011 (Wójcik et al., 2013), damage to private households of more than 70 million EUR in Münster (Germany) in 2014 (Spekkers et al., 2017) and during the 2021 floods in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands over 200 deaths, damage to thousands of homes and disrupted water and electricity supply (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events is projected to increase (high confidence) (Figure 13.3; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Combined with increasing urbanisation, the risk of pluvial flooding is projected to increase (Westra et al., 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Papalexiou and Montanari, 2019). Small catchments, steep river channels and cities are particularly vulnerable due to large areas of impermeable surfaces where water cannot penetrate (Section 13.6)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The frequency and severity of low flows are projected to increase, making streamflow drought and water scarcity more severe and persistent in SEU and WCE (medium confidence) (Figure 13.3; Ranasinghe et al., 2021), but decreases are projected in most of NEU except the southern UK (Forzieri et al., 2014; Prudhomme et al., 2014; Schewe et al., 2014; Roudier et al., 2016; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). In EEU, uncertainty about changes in water scarcity pose distinct challenges for adaptation (Greve et al., 2018). At 1.5°C GWL, the number of days with water scarcity (water availability as opposed to water demand) and drought will increase slightly in SEU (Schleussner et al., 2016; Naumann et al., 2018), resulting in 18% of the population exposed to at least moderate water scarcity, increasing to 54% at 2°C GWL (Byers et al., 2018). Moderate water scarcity is emerging in some parts of WCE (Bisselink et al., 2018) increasing to16% of the population under 2°C GWL and SSP2 (Byers et al., 2018). Under 4°C GWL, areas in WCE experience water scarcity, especially in summer and autumn. Future intensive water use can aggravate the situation, in particular in SEU (Sections 13.5.1, 13.10.3)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Groundwater abstraction rates reach up to 100 million m³ yr –1 across WCE and SEU, and exceed 100 million m³ yr –1 in parts of SEU (Wada, 2016). Low recharge rates lead to a depletion of groundwater resources in parts of SEU and WCE (Doll et al., 2014; Wada, 2016; de Graaf et al., 2017), increasing the impacts on water scarcity in SEU. Groundwater pumping and declines in groundwater discharge already threaten environmental flow limits in many European catchments, especially in SEU, extending to almost all basins and sub-basins within the next 30–50 years (de Graaf et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The combined effect of increasing water demand and successive dry climatic conditions further exacerbates groundwater depletion and lowers groundwater levels in SEU but also WCE (Goderniaux et al., 2015). Declines in groundwater recharge of up to 30% further increase groundwater depletion (Aeschbach-Hertig and Gleeson, 2012) especially in SEU and semiarid to arid regions (Moutahir et al., 2017). Even in WCE and NEU, projected increases in groundwater abstraction will impact groundwater discharge, threatening sustaining environmental flows under dry conditions (de Graaf et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The risks for soil moisture drought are projected to increase in WCE and SEU for all climate scenarios (Grillakis, 2019; Tramblay et al., 2020; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). At 3°C GWL compared with 1.5°C GWL, the drought area will increase by 40% and the population under drought by up to 42%, especially affecting SEU, and to a lesser extent in WCE (Samaniego et al., 2018 )."

Warming is accelerating for all European river basins (Wanders et al., 2019) increasing by 0.8°C in response to 1.5°C GWL and 1.2°C for 3°C GWL relative to 1971–2000 (van Vliet et al., 2016a) aggravated by declines in summer river flow."
wg2_ch13_13.2.1.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"(Ground)water extractions or drainage have caused saltwater intrusions (Rasmussen et al., 2013; Ketabchi et al., 2016). During summer, seawater will also penetrate estuaries further upstream in response to reduced river flow and SLR, resulting in more frequent closure of water inlets in the downstream part of the rivers in a period when water is most needed (high agreement, low evidence) (e.g., Haasnoot et al., 2020b)."
wg2_ch13_box-13.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Venice and its lagoon are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This socio-ecological system is the result of millennia of interactions between people and the natural environment. It is exposed to climatic and non-climatic hazards: more frequent floods, warming, pollution, invasive species, reduction of salt marshes, hydrodynamic and bathymetric changes, and waves generated by cruise ships and boat traffic."
wg2_ch13_box-13.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The elevation of the average city pedestrian level and of its inner historic area are, respectively, 105 and 55 cm above the present relative mean sea level (RMSL). Consequently, even small surges and compound events cause floods when they coincide with high tide (Lionello et al., 2021a). During the 20th century, RMSL rose at about 2.5 mm yr –1 due to SLR and land subsidence (Zanchettin et al., 2021). The frequency of floods affecting the city has increased from once per decade in the first half of the 20th century to 40 times per decade in the period 2010–2019 (Figure Box 13.1.1a)."
wg2_ch13_box-13.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"In 1973, the Italian government established a legal framework for safeguarding Venice and its lagoon. Construction of the flood protection system started in 2003 and was used for the first time in October 2020 (Lionello et al., 2021b). This system of mobile barriers (MoSE) closes the lagoon inlets to avoid floods when needed, while under normal conditions they lay on the seabed, thus allowing ship traffic and the exchange between the lagoon and the sea (Molinaroli et al., 2019). To prevent flooding of the central monument area, additional measures have been proposed including inlets, expansion of salt marshes and pumping seawater into deep brackish aquifers to raise the city’s level (Umgiesser, 1999; Umgiesser, 2004; Teatini et al., 2011)."
wg2_ch13_box-13.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Without adaptation, potential economic damages between 7 and 17 billion EUR have been estimated for the next 50 years (Caporin and Fontini, 2016). Additionally, the ecosystem is vulnerable to warming (Solidoro et al., 2010) and SLR (Day Jr et al., 1999; Marani et al., 2007). The duration of the closure of the lagoon inlets is expected to increase from 2 to 3 weeks yr –1 for RMSL rises of 30 cm, to 2 months yr –1 for 50 cm and 6 months yr –1 for 75 cm (Figure Box 13.1.1b; Umgiesser, 2020; Lionello et al., 2021b), resulting in disconnection from the sea for most of the time for RMSL rise exceeding 75 cm. Frequent closures of the inlets would prevent ship traffic and in/outflow of water. For Venice, adaptation pathways considering the full range of plausible RMSL (Figure Box 13.1.1c) levels are not available, indicating a long-term adaptation gap. As planning and implementation of adaptation of this extent can take several decades (Haasnoot et al., 2020b; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3), this increases the risk that the city will not be prepared in case of rapid SLR."

While adaptive strategies are increasingly considered as an approach to strengthen flexibility and implement climate-change adaptation actions, given deep uncertainty about the future (Ranger et al., 2013; Klijn et al., 2015; Bloemen et al., 2019; Hall et al., 2019; Pot et al., 2019), more traditional water management approaches still dominate across Europe (OECD, 2013; OECD, 2015; Wiering et al., 2017). Current measures focus on structural flood protection and water resources supply and play an important role to preserve present land use and development patterns. The long-term effectiveness of such measures is increasingly challenged by their reinforcing path dependency (e.g., flood defence and water supply attract developments which require further protection and supply). This path dependency limits the solution space and may hamper implementation of transformative measures, such as land-use change, to accommodate the water system (medium confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Kreibich et al., 2015; Alfieri et al., 2016; Gralepois et al., 2016; Welch et al., 2017; Di Baldassarre et al., 2018; Haer et al., 2020)."

Differences are apparent, for example, in coastal adaptation where most, but not all, countries are planning for SLR (Figure 13.5; McEvoy et al., 2021). Although the planning horizon of 2100 and 1-m SLR are most common (adjusted for local conditions), there are significant differences between countries (e.g., the high-end SLR value in 2100 ranges from 0.3 to 3 m), which may lead to unequal impacts over time (McEvoy et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.2.2.1_p1,13.2.2.1.1 Coastal flood risk management ,"Across Europe a range of measures have been implemented to address flood risk (Figure 13.6), with protection as the most used strategy (high confidence). Early warning and flood protection have been successful in reducing vulnerability to coastal and riverine flooding (Jongman et al., 2015; Kreibich et al., 2015; Bouwer and Jonkman, 2018). Consequently, fatalities due to river flooding have decreased in Europe, despite similar numbers of people exposed (1990–2010 compared with 1980–1989) (Jongman et al., 2015; Paprotny et al., 2018a)."

At least 83% of flood damages due to coastal flooding could be avoided by elevating dykes along ~23–32% of Europe’s coastline by 2100 (RCP4.5-SSP1, RCP8.5-SSP5) (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). Limitations of building flood defences include cost–benefit considerations in rural areas, available land and social acceptability in densely populated areas (Haasnoot et al., 2018; Hinkel et al., 2018; Meyerhoff et al., 2021)."

Coastal wetlands can be effective to reduce wave height and form habitats, but their feasibility and effectiveness is limited for densely populated areas with competing land use, runoff of pollution, sediment-starved deltas like the Rhine Delta (Edmonds et al., 2020) and rapid SLR (Kirwan et al., 2016; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2020b). While losses of wetlands could be minor if warming stays below 1.7°C GWL, at high warming or SLR above 0.5 m large-scale losses of these habitats will impact their ecological importance, ecosystem function (Section 13.4; KR 1, Section 13.10.2) and their ability to protect coastlines (Roebeling et al., 2013; van der Spek, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Xi et al., 2021). A combination with structural defences could reduce risk in urbanised coastal regions (high confidence). Accommodation through elevated or floating houses have been implemented and proposed locally within cities as part of a hybrid strategy together with protection and as a way of innovative urban development (Section 13.6.2; Cross-Chapter Paper 2; Penning-Rowsell, 2020; Storbjörk and Hjerpe, 2021)."

In the Barents Sea, however, largely stable primary production is projected under all scenarios in response to sea ice decline (Slagstad et al., 2011) and in the eastern Mediterranean due to reduced stratification (Macias et al., 2015; Moullec et al., 2019). These changes in productivity are projected to increase fish and macroinvertebrate biomass between 5 and 22% (Moullec et al., 2019). Decreasing net primary production will impact higher trophic levels (Section 13.5.1), for example, in TEUS (Holt et al., 2016; Holt et al., 2018). Marine animal biomass is projected to likely  decline in most European waters, with decreases <10% under all scenarios until the 2030s but losses growing to 25% at 2°C GWL and 50% at 4°C GWL in coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic (Lotze et al., 2019; Bryndum-Buchholz et al., 2020)."

Europe’s coastal vegetated ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems (subtidal seagrass meadows and intertidal salt marshes) are highly vulnerable (Spencer et al., 2016; Schuerch et al., 2018; Spivak et al., 2019), particularly in microtidal areas such as the Baltic and Mediterranean coast. Losses are projected for Posidonia oceanica seagrass habitats in the Mediterranean by up to 75% at 2.5°C GWL (low confidence) (Chapter 3). The Wadden Sea, the world’s largest system of intertidal flats, is projected to reduce in surface area and height, as the sediment transport capacity limits the possibility of growth with rapidly rising sea levels (Wang et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2020). For the Dutch Wadden Sea, the critical rate of 6–10 mm yr –1, at which intertidal flats will start to ‘drown’, will be reached by 2030 at 1.5°C GWL (medium confidence), or even earlier through subsidence due to human activities (van der Spek, 2018).

In the Russian Arctic, mainly the Barents Sea, conservation priority areas (CPA) have been identified as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSA) (Solovyev et al., 2017); however, plans are generally at a relatively early stage (Miller et al., 2018) and assessments of the effectiveness of these policy frameworks to accelerate climate-change adaptation are ongoing (Haasnoot et al., 2020a)."

The extent of MPAs has been increasing in Europe, albeit with strong regional variations (Figure 13.12). These MPAs provide protection from local stressors, such as commercial exploitation, and enhance the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems, thus lessening the impacts of climate change (medium confidence) (Narayan et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017); however, climate-change risk reduction is only a limited MPA objective (Hopkins et al., 2016b; Rilov et al., 2019). The implementation of the legal frameworks, such as the EC Habitats Directive and EC Birds Directive, allows for enabling adaptation (Verschuuren, 2015) as does the incorporation of climate considerations in management of Natura 2000 sites (European Comission, 2014). There is evidence that better international cooperation is required to increase the effectiveness of the MSFD (Cavallo et al., 2019), and the Good Environmental Status is currently not effectively monitored (Machado et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch13_13.4.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"The greatest benefits are obtained from large, long-established, no-take MPAs (Edgar et al., 2014), yet most MPAs in Europe are partially protected or multi-use areas, and existing no-take areas tend to be very small (<50 km 2). No-take areas account, in total, for less than 0.4% of the area of European waters (Figure 13.12) and are often nested within multi-use MPAs. In some partially protected MPAs, local stressors, such as fishing, are higher than adjacent unprotected areas (medium confidence) (Zupan et al., 2018a; Mazaris et al., 2019). Despite evidence for climate mitigation benefits of no-take zones (Roberts et al., 2017), the efficacy of partially protected MPAs is debated and dependent on local management (Zupan et al., 2018b). Marine protected areas of all types require effective management to contribute to mitigating climate-change impacts, including effective monitoring and enforcement (Watson et al., 2014), yet the management effectiveness of European MPAs has repeatedly been called into question (Batista and Cabral, 2016; Amengual and Alvarez-Berastegui, 2018; Fraschetti et al., 2018; Rilov et al., 2019). Many MPAs lack management plans, and insufficient resources are frequently an issue (Álvarez-Fernández et al., 2017; Schéré et al., 2020). Thus, while substantial in potential, the current capacity of the European MPA network to reduce climate-change impacts is limited (Jones et al., 2016; Claudet et al., 2020)."

Moreover, the interaction of adaptation and mitigation measures poses risks to marine systems. Many coastal regions of the North Sea, especially in the south, are particularly susceptible to rising sea levels because of the strong tidal regime and the effects of storm surges (Figure 13.3). Hard measures to protect human infrastructure against SLR (Section 13.2) will lead to loss of coastal habitats, with negative impacts on marine biodiversity (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Airoldi and Beck, 2007; Cooper et al., 2016). While rising sea levels will also directly threaten intertidal and beach ecosystems, coastal wetlands will benefit (medium confidence), in case lateral accommodation space and the opportunity for systems to migrate landward and upwards is provided, enhancing their ability to capture and store carbon (Lecocq et al., 2022; Rogers et al., 2019). In general, European coastal blue carbon ecosystems (e.g., seagrass meadows, kelp forests, tidal marshes) (Bekkby et al., 2020) are potentially effective as carbon sinks in climate mitigation, akin to reforestation efforts on land (Section 13.3); however, their expansion has the potential to interfere with other ecosystem services (Cadier et al., 2020) and biodiversity conservation (Howard et al., 2017; Chausson et al., 2020). The ‘Blue Growth’ strategy of the European Commission with the aim to increase offshore activities (European Comission, 2012) will increase the pressures on the marine environments (medium confidence). Large-scale offshore wind-park infrastructure is currently developed in European seas, mostly in the North Sea (WindEuropeBusinessIntelligence, 2019), as a major component of climate-change mitigation efforts (Clarke et al., 2022). The introduction of novel hard-substrate intertidal habitats has, and will continue to have, profound ecological ramifications for marine systems, including hydrodynamic changes, stepping stones for non-native species, noise and vibration, and changes in the food web (high confidence) (Lindeboom et al., 2011; De Mesel et al., 2015; Gill et al., 2018; Dannheim et al., 2019)."

Together with water-cooling constraints for thermal power, this change in load may challenge the stability of electricity networks during heatwaves (EEA, 2019a). Technological factors, increased electricity use and adaptation influence significantly the temperature sensitivity of electricity demand and consequently risks (Damm et al., 2017; Wenz et al., 2017; Cassarino et al., 2018; Figueiredo et al., 2020).

The sectors with a high percentage of high-intensity outdoor work in Europe, mainly agriculture and construction, have the highest risk of increased injury and labour productivity losses, but also manufacturing and service sectors can be affected when air conditioning is not available (Section 13.6.1.3; Gosling et al., 2018; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Dellink et al., 2019; Orlov et al., 2019). The heatwaves of August 2003, July 2010 and July 2015 were concentrated in SEU and led to reductions in monthly worker productivity of on average 3–3.5% in SEU, ranging up to 8–9% in Cyprus (2003, 2010) and Italy (2015) (Orlov et al., 2019); in contrast, the heatwave of 2018 centred on NEU but also led to pronounced productivity reductions in WCE and SEU (García-León et al., 2021).

Lower perception of health risks has been observed among vulnerable groups which, in conjunction with perceived high costs of protective measures, act as barriers to implementing health adaptation plans (van Loenhout et al., 2016; Macintyre et al., 2018; Martinez et al., 2019). Key barriers to mental health adaptation actions include lack of funding, coordination, monitoring and training (e.g., psychological first aid) (Hayes and Poland, 2018). Existing health measures, such as monitoring and early warning systems, play an important role in detecting and communicating emerging climate risks and weather extremes (high confidence) (Confalonieri et al., 2015; Casanueva et al., 2019; Linares et al., 2020).

A study of nine European cities, for example, showed lower numbers of heat-related deaths in SEU and attributed this to the implementation of heat prevention plans, a greater level of individual and household adaptation, and growing awareness about exposure to heat (de’Donato et al., 2015). Long-term national prevention programmes in NEU have been shown to reduce temperature-related suicide (Helama et al., 2013). The physical fitness of individuals may increase resilience to extreme heat (Schuster et al., 2017).

Health adaptations can also have negative trade-offs, be inconsistent with mitigation ambitions and could lead to maladaptation. Green–blue spaces, for example, may create new nesting grounds for carriers of vector-borne diseases, increase pollen and allergies (Kabisch et al., 2016), enlarge freshwater use for irrigation (Reyes-Paecke et al., 2019) and could raise climate equity and justice issues such as green gentrification (Yazar et al., 2019). Similarly, air conditioning and cooling devices are considered highly effective but have low economic and social feasibility as well as negative trade-offs due to increasing energy consumption, raising energy costs which is particularly challenging for the poor (Section 13.8.1.1), enhancing the UHI effect and increasing noise pollution (Fernandez Milan and Creutzig, 2015; Hunt et al., 2017; Macintyre et al., 2018)."

It is mainly driven by the increase in the likelihood of compound heat and dry conditions and extreme weather, and their impact on crops. There is high confidence that climate change will increase the likelihood of concurrent extremely dry (Table SM13.28) and hot warm seasons with higher risks for WCE, EEU (particularly northwest Russia) and SEU leading to enhanced risk of crop failure and decrease in pasture quality (Section 13.5.1; Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Sedlmeier et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2021). The risk is already moderately severe due to multiple crop failures in the past decade in WCE and Russia (Section 13.5.1; Hao et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). Under high-end scenarios, heat and drought extremes are projected to become more frequent and widespread as early as mid-century (Toreti et al., 2019a). For present to moderate adaptation and at least up to 2.5°GWL, negative consequences are mostly in SEU (Bird et al., 2016; EEA, 2019c; Moretti et al., 2019; Feyen et al., 2020). The transition from moderate to high risk is projected to happen around 2.7°C GWL when hazards and risk will become more persistent and widespread in other regions (Section 13.1; Deryng et al., 2014; Donatelli et al., 2015; Webber et al., 2018; Ceglar et al., 2019; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). This temperature increase will trigger shifts in agricultural zones, onset of early heat stress, losses in maize yield of up to 28% across EU-28 and regional disparity in losses and gains in wheat, which are not able to offset losses across the continent (Deryng et al., 2014; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Ceglar et al., 2019). There will be also broader adverse impacts such as reduction of grassland biomass production for fodder, increases in weeds and reduction in pollination (medium confidence) (Castellanos-Frias et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2017; Brás et al., 2019). Combined with socioeconomic development, increased heat and drought stress, and reduced irrigation water availability, in SEU are projected to lead to abandonment of farmland (Holman et al., 2017). Around 4°C GWL, the risk is very high due to persistent heat and dry conditions (Ben-Ari et al., 2018) and the emergence of losses also in NEU which would be much higher without the assumed CO2 fertilisation (Deryng et al., 2014; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch13_13.10.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Farmers have historically adapted to environmental changes, and such autonomous adaptation will continue. Higher CO2 levels have a fertilisation effect on plants that is considered to decrease crop production risks (Deryng et al., 2014). Adaptation solutions to heat and drought risks include changes in sowing and harvest dates, increased irrigation, changes in crop varieties, the use of cover crops and mixed agricultural practices (Section 13.5.2; Figures 13.14, Figure 13.30b). Under high adaptation, the use of irrigation can substantially reduce risk by both reducing canopy temperature and drought impacts (high confidence) (Section 13.5.2; Webber et al., 2018). Some reductions of maize yields in SEU are still possible, but are balanced by gains in other crops and regions (Deryng et al., 2014; Donatelli et al., 2015; Webber et al., 2018; Feyen et al., 2020). At 3°C GWL and beyond, the adaptive capacity is reduced (Ruiz-Ramos et al., 2018). Crop production is a major consumer of water in agriculture (Gerveni et al., 2020), yet a potentially scarcer supply of water in some regions must be distributed across many needs (KR3, Section 13.10.2.3), limiting availability to agriculture which is currently the main user of water in many regions of Europe (high confidence) (Section 13.5.1). Where the ability to irrigate is limited by water availability, other adaptation options are insufficient to mitigate crop losses in some sub-regions, particularly at 3°C GWL and above, with an increase in risk from north to south and higher risk for late-season crops such as maize (high confidence). Under these conditions, land abandonment is projected (low confidence) (Holman et al., 2017)."

Yet, there is emerging evidence that drought-related risks increase with warming beyond 3°C GWL also in EEU (Seneviratne, 2021, for hydrological drought and 4°C GWL; Kattsov and Porfiriev, 2020). Evidence from the detected changes and attribution assessment suggests that the risk is already moderate in SEU (e.g., 48 million people exposed to moderate water scarcity between 1981 and 2010) (high confidence) (Section 13.10.1; Figure 13.31a)."
wg2_ch13_13.10.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Risk of water scarcity has a high potential to lead to cascading impacts well beyond the water sector.

Extensive water extraction will augment pressures on water reserves, impacting the ecological status of rivers and ecosystems dependent on them (Grizzetti et al., 2017). Socioeconomic conditions contributing to severe consequences are when more residents settle in drought-prone regions, or when the share of agriculture in GDP declines (high confidence). For Europe, risks of water scarcity will be higher under SSP5 and SSP3 than under SSP1 (medium confidence) (Byers et al., 2018; Arnell et al., 2019; Harrison et al., 2019). Transition to high risks is projected to occur below 2°C GWL in SEU and be associated with more persistent droughts (Section 13.1.3), and at 2°C GWL to show a 54% increase of the population facing at least moderate levels of water shortage (Byers et al., 2018). This transition will happen at higher warming in WCE since risks are projected to increase less rapidly (transition between 2°C and 3°C GWL) (medium confidence) (Section 13.2.1.2; Byers et al., 2018).

Several measures are already in place showing high technical and institutional feasibility (Sections 13.2.2.2, 13.5.2.1). The effectiveness of options varies regionally (in particular between northern and southern regions). For example, in SEU many water reservoirs are already in place. Irrigation is used to support agriculture where rain-fed supplies are not sufficient (Section 13.5.2). Their future extension depends on available precipitation. Also, wastewater reuse can only be effective if sufficient wastewater is available. Improvements in water efficiency and behavioural changes are very effective in SEU (>25% of damages avoided) (Section 13.2.2.2). Investments in large water infrastructures and advanced technologies (including storage), water transfer, water recycling and reuse, and desalination will allow to buy time and therefore to cope with additional warming (Papadaskalopoulou et al., 2016; Greve et al., 2018). Beyond 2.5°C GWL, transformational adaptation is needed to lower risk levels, such as planned relocation of industry, abandonment of farmland or the development of alternative livelihoods (Holman et al., 2017). In WCE, the solution space to water scarcity is expanding with considerable potential for investments in large water infrastructure and advanced technologies (including storage), for reducing risks above 3°C GWL (Greve et al., 2018).

More intense heatwaves on land and in the ocean, particularly in Mediterranean Europe (Section 13.4; Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Darmaraki et al., 2019b; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), are expected to cause mass mortalities of vulnerable species, and species extinction, altering the provision of important ecosystem goods and services (Marbà and Duarte, 2010)."

There is high confidence that the risk is already moderate now because it has been detected and attributed with high confidence (Section 13.10.1). The transition from moderate to high risk for human health is assessed to happen after 1.5°C GWL in a scenario with present to medium adaptation and implies a two- to threefold increase (compared with moderate risk levels) in magnitude of consequences such as mortality, morbidity, heat stress and thermal discomfort (Rohat et al., 2019; Casanueva et al., 2020; Naumann et al., 2020). At this level, the risk will also become more persistent across the continent due to increase in heat events exceeding critical thresholds for health (high confidence on the direction of change and temperature transition, but medium confidence on the magnitude) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021)."

While some terrestrial ecosystems are already impacted today, such as Alpine, cryosphere and peatlands, the impacts are not widespread and severe yet across a wide range of terrestrial systems. Around 2°C GWL, losses accelerate in marine ecosystem and appear across systems, including habitat losses especially in coastal wetlands (Roebeling et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2020), biodiversity and biomass losses (Bryndum-Buchholz et al., 2019; Lotze et al., 2019) and ecosystem services such as fishing (high confidence on the direction of change, but medium confidence on the local and regional magnitude) (Raybaud et al., 2017).

The illustrative adaptation pathways in Figure 13.29b,c show the sequencing of options to a high adaptation future for NEU and SEU. Whether or not adaptation measures are effective to reduce risk severity for people’s health depends on local context (high confidence) (Figure 13.29; Sections 13.6.2, 13.7.2). Some adaptation options are found to be highly effective across Europe irrespective of warming levels, including air conditioning and urban planning (high confidence) (Sections 13.6.2, 13.7.2; Jenkins et al., 2014b; Donner et al., 2015; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Åström et al., 2017; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019; Venter et al., 2020), although air conditioning increasingly faces some feasibility constraints (Figure 13.20). Building interventions alone have low to medium effectiveness independent of the region. Many behavioural changes, such as personal and home heat protection, have already been implemented in SEU (Section 13.7.2; Martinez et al., 2019). To reach high adaptation, a combination of low, medium and high effectiveness measures in different sectors and sub-regions is needed, many of which entail systems’ transformations (e.g., heat-proof land management) (Chapter 16) and remain effective at higher warming levels (medium confidence) (Díaz et al., 2019). These transformations have long lead times, thereby requiring timely start of implementation including regions that are not yet experiencing high heat stress (e.g., NEU) (high agreement, medium evidence)."

A reduction of non-climatic stressors, such as nutrient loads, resource extraction, habitat fragmentation or pesticides on land, are considered important adaptation options to increase the resilience to climate-change impacts (high confidence) (Sections 13.3, 13.4; Ramírez et al., 2018). A major governance tool to reduce climatic and non-climatic impacts is the establishment of networks of protected areas (Sections 13.3.2, 13.4.2) especially when aggregated, zoned or linked with corridors for migration (high confidence), as well as a cost-effective adaptation strategy with multiple additional co-benefits (Berry et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2017). Reforestation, rewilding and habitat restoration are long-term strategies for reducing risk for biodiversity loss supported by assisted migration and evolution (Section 13.3.2, 13.4), though current laws and regulations do not include species migration (high confidence) (Prober et al., 2019; Fernandez-Anez et al., 2021)."

Projected SLR will strongly impact coastal ecosystems (high confidence), minimising their contribution to shoreline protection (Section 13.10.2.4)."
wg2_ch13_13.10.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Key risk 2 encompasses agriculture productivity (Figure 13.30a). It is mainly driven by the increase in the likelihood of compound heat and dry conditions and extreme weather, and their impact on crops. There is high confidence that climate change will increase the likelihood of concurrent extremely dry (Table SM13.28) and hot warm seasons with higher risks for WCE, EEU (particularly northwest Russia) and SEU leading to enhanced risk of crop failure and decrease in pasture quality (Section 13.5.1; Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Sedlmeier et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2021). The risk is already moderately severe due to multiple crop failures in the past decade in WCE and Russia (Section 13.5.1; Hao et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). Under high-end scenarios, heat and drought extremes are projected to become more frequent and widespread as early as mid-century (Toreti et al., 2019a). For present to moderate adaptation and at least up to 2.5°GWL, negative consequences are mostly in SEU (Bird et al., 2016; EEA, 2019c; Moretti et al., 2019; Feyen et al., 2020). The transition from moderate to high risk is projected to happen around 2.7°C GWL when hazards and risk will become more persistent and widespread in other regions (Section 13.1; Deryng et al., 2014; Donatelli et al., 2015; Webber et al., 2018; Ceglar et al., 2019; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). This temperature increase will trigger shifts in agricultural zones, onset of early heat stress, losses in maize yield of up to 28% across EU-28 and regional disparity in losses and gains in wheat, which are not able to offset losses across the continent (Deryng et al., 2014; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Ceglar et al., 2019). There will be also broader adverse impacts such as reduction of grassland biomass production for fodder, increases in weeds and reduction in pollination (medium confidence) (Castellanos-Frias et al., 2016; Nielsen et al., 2017; Brás et al., 2019). Combined with socioeconomic development, increased heat and drought stress, and reduced irrigation water availability, in SEU are projected to lead to abandonment of farmland (Holman et al., 2017). Around 4°C GWL, the risk is very high due to persistent heat and dry conditions (Ben-Ari et al., 2018) and the emergence of losses also in NEU which would be much higher without the assumed CO2 fertilisation (Deryng et al., 2014; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch13_13.10.2.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Farmers have historically adapted to environmental changes, and such autonomous adaptation will continue. Higher CO2 levels have a fertilisation effect on plants that is considered to decrease crop production risks (Deryng et al., 2014). Adaptation solutions to heat and drought risks include changes in sowing and harvest dates, increased irrigation, changes in crop varieties, the use of cover crops and mixed agricultural practices (Section 13.5.2; Figures 13.14, Figure 13.30b). Under high adaptation, the use of irrigation can substantially reduce risk by both reducing canopy temperature and drought impacts (high confidence) (Section 13.5.2; Webber et al., 2018). Some reductions of maize yields in SEU are still possible, but are balanced by gains in other crops and regions (Deryng et al., 2014; Donatelli et al., 2015; Webber et al., 2018; Feyen et al., 2020). At 3°C GWL and beyond, the adaptive capacity is reduced (Ruiz-Ramos et al., 2018). Crop production is a major consumer of water in agriculture (Gerveni et al., 2020), yet a potentially scarcer supply of water in some regions must be distributed across many needs (KR3, Section 13.10.2.3), limiting availability to agriculture which is currently the main user of water in many regions of Europe (high confidence) (Section 13.5.1). Where the ability to irrigate is limited by water availability, other adaptation options are insufficient to mitigate crop losses in some sub-regions, particularly at 3°C GWL and above, with an increase in risk from north to south and higher risk for late-season crops such as maize (high confidence). Under these conditions, land abandonment is projected (low confidence) (Holman et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch13_13.10.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Risks related to water scarcity across multiple sectors can become severe in WCE and, to a much larger extent, in SEU based on projections of drought damage, population and sectors exposed, and they increase in water exploitation (Figure 13.31a; Table SM13.29). In EEU, uncertainty in hydrological drought projections and risk consequences is higher (Greve et al., 2018; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021) and the available number of publications is lower, not allowing a conclusion on how risk levels change with GWL. Yet, there is emerging evidence that drought-related risks increase with warming beyond 3°C GWL also in EEU (Seneviratne, 2021, for hydrological drought and 4°C GWL; Kattsov and Porfiriev, 2020). Evidence from the detected changes and attribution assessment suggests that the risk is already moderate in SEU (e.g., 48 million people exposed to moderate water scarcity between 1981 and 2010) (high confidence) (Section 13.10.1; Figure 13.31a)."
wg2_ch13_13.10.2.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Risk of water scarcity has a high potential to lead to cascading impacts well beyond the water sector. These materialize in a number of highly interconnected sectors from agriculture and livestock farming to energy (hydropower and cooling of thermal power plants) and industry (e.g., shipping) (Blauhut et al., 2015; Stahl et al., 2016; Bisselink et al., 2020; Cammalleri et al., 2020). Extensive water extraction will augment pressures on water reserves, impacting the ecological status of rivers and ecosystems dependent on them (Grizzetti et al., 2017). Socioeconomic conditions contributing to severe consequences are when more residents settle in drought-prone regions, or when the share of agriculture in GDP declines (high confidence). For Europe, risks of water scarcity will be higher under SSP5 and SSP3 than under SSP1 (medium confidence) (Byers et al., 2018; Arnell et al., 2019; Harrison et al., 2019). Transition to high risks is projected to occur below 2°C GWL in SEU and be associated with more persistent droughts (Section 13.1.3), and at 2°C GWL to show a 54% increase of the population facing at least moderate levels of water shortage (Byers et al., 2018). This transition will happen at higher warming in WCE since risks are projected to increase less rapidly (transition between 2°C and 3°C GWL) (medium confidence) (Section 13.2.1.2; Byers et al., 2018). At 3°C GWL and beyond, water scarcity will become much more widespread and severe in already water-scarce areas in SEU (high confidence) and will expand to currently non-water-scarce regions in WCE (medium confidence) (Section 13.2.1.2; Bisselink et al., 2018; Naumann et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019; Koutroulis et al., 2019; Cammalleri et al., 2020; Spinoni et al., 2020).

Several measures are already in place showing high technical and institutional feasibility (Sections 13.2.2.2, 13.5.2.1). The effectiveness of options varies regionally (in particular between northern and southern regions). For example, in SEU many water reservoirs are already in place. Irrigation is used to support agriculture where rain-fed supplies are not sufficient (Section 13.5.2). Their future extension depends on available precipitation. Also, wastewater reuse can only be effective if sufficient wastewater is available. Improvements in water efficiency and behavioural changes are very effective in SEU (>25% of damages avoided) (Section 13.2.2.2). Investments in large water infrastructures and advanced technologies (including storage), water transfer, water recycling and reuse, and desalination will allow to buy time and therefore to cope with additional warming (Papadaskalopoulou et al., 2016; Greve et al., 2018). Beyond 2.5°C GWL, transformational adaptation is needed to lower risk levels, such as planned relocation of industry, abandonment of farmland or the development of alternative livelihoods (Holman et al., 2017). In WCE, the solution space to water scarcity is expanding with considerable potential for investments in large water infrastructure and advanced technologies (including storage), for reducing risks above 3°C GWL (Greve et al., 2018). Under medium warming a larger portfolio of measures might be needed in SEU in particular, although it may not be able to completely avoid water shortages at high warming."

There is evidence of action across sectors and scales, even in European countries where national adaptation frameworks are absent (medium confidence) (Figure 13.34; De Gregorio Hurtado et al., 2015; Pietrapertosa et al., 2018; Reckien et al., 2018). However, the implementation gap identified in AR5 (Chambwera et al., 2014), that is, the gap between defined goals and ambitions and actual implemented actions on the ground, persists in Europe (Aguiar et al., 2018; Russel et al., 2020; UNEP, 2021)."
wg2_ch13_13.11.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The drivers of adaptation progress in Europe differ across sectors and regions. Common drivers include: experienced climatic events, improved climatic information, societal pressures to act, projected economic and societal costs of climate change, participation in (city) networks, societal and political leadership, and changes in national and European policies and legislation (medium evidence, high agreement ) (EEA, 2014; Massey et al., 2014; Reckien et al., 2018). The availability of knowledge, human and financial resources appears important for proactive adaptation (Termeer et al., 2012; Sanderson et al., 2018), while adaptation is also strongly dependent on economic and social development (high confidence) (Sanderson et al., 2018). How adaptation is governed differs substantially across Europe (Clar, 2019; Lesnikowski et al., 2021). Political commitment, persistence and consistent action across scales of government is critical to move beyond planning for adaptation (Steps A–C in Figure 13.34) and to ensure adequacy of implementation (Steps D and E in Figure 13.34) (Howlett and Kemmerling, 2017; Lesnikowski et al., 2021; Patterson, 2021)."

Systemic and cascading risks (Section 13.10) are often recognised, but most conventional risk assessment methods that inform adaptation planning are ill-equipped to deal with these effects (Adger et al., 2018). For example, transboundary risks emerging in regions outside of Europe are considered only by a few countries such as the UK and Germany (Section 13.9.3). European climate change adaptation strategies and national policies are generally weak on gender, sexual orientation, as well as other social equality issues (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18; Boeckmann and Zeeb, 2014; Allwood, 2020)."
wg2_ch13_13.11.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Many near-term investment decisions have long-term consequences, and planning and implementation (Steps C and D in Figure 13.34) can take decades, particularly for critical infrastructure planning in Europe (Zandvoort et al., 2017; Pot et al., 2018). Consequently, there are calls to expand planning horizons, to consider long-term uncertainties to prevent lock-in decision dependencies, to seize opportunities and synergies from other investments (e.g., socioeconomic developments and systems transitions) and to broaden the range of considered possible impacts (e.g., Frantzeskaki et al., 2019; Marchau, 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2020b ). Yet, high GWL scenarios beyond 2100 are often not considered in climate-change adaptation planning due to a lack of perceived usability, missing socioeconomic information, constraining institutional settings and conflicting decision-making timeframes (medium confidence) (Lourenco et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2020). High GWL scenarios are often seen as having a low probability of occurrence, resulting in inaction or incremental rather than transformative adaptation responses to projected climate risks (Dunn et al., 2017). Extending planning horizons to beyond 2100 increases deep uncertainties for decision makers as a result of unclear future socioeconomic and climatic changes. For adaptation to SLR along Europe’s coast, for example, there are already considerable uncertainties during this century (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021)."

Adaptation pathways also have been developed for planning urban water supply (Kingsborough et al., 2016; Erfani et al., 2018), urban drainage (Babovic and Mijic, 2019) and wastewater systems (Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17; Sadr et al., 2020). Flexible strategies are increasingly considered by European countries (e.g., Stive et al., 2013; Kreibich et al., 2015; Bubeck et al., 2017; Haasnoot et al., 2019) but require appropriate design to be effective (Metzger et al., 2021)."

In the Netherlands, a comprehensive monitoring system has been put in place, including signals for adaptation that support decisions on when to implement adaptation options or to adjust plans (Hermans et al., 2017; Haasnoot et al., 2018; Bloemen et al., 2019)."

These services are increasingly used in NEU, SEU and WCE, for example, in energy and risk prevention in coastal and riverine cities, stimulating regulations and bottom-up initiatives (Cavelier et al., 2017; Le Cozannet et al., 2017; Reckien et al., 2018; Howard et al., 2020). However, climate service efficacy is rarely systematically evaluated (Cortekar et al., 2020). Barriers to use include: lack of perceived usefulness of climate information to organisations and expertise to use the information, outdated statistics, mismatch between needs and type of information made available, insufficient effective engagement between providers and recipients of climate information and lack of business models to sustain climate services over time (high evidence, medium agreement ) (Cavelier et al., 2017; Räsänen et al., 2017; Bruno Soares et al., 2018; Christel et al., 2018; Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018; Hewitt et al., 2020).

Yet, only 14 EU countries have announced such budget allocations in their plans and strategies; and even if budget numbers are available, they are difficult to compare (EEA, 2020a). Current adaptation spending varies greatly across and within European countries, partly reflecting (sub)national adaptation priorities or financing sources targeting investment projects (López-Dóriga et al., 2020; Russel et al., 2020) and competing statutory priorities (Porter et al., 2015). European government budgets are also burdened by climate-change damages today, particularly after huge flooding events, and austerity following financial crises, limiting anticipatory action (Penning-Rowsell and Priest, 2015; Miskic et al., 2017; Schinko et al., 2017; Slavíková et al., 2020). National adaptation funding in EU member states is complemented by EU funding (e.g., European Structural and Investment Funds, European Regional Development Funds, and LIFE program). While the EU spending target on climate action increased from 20% in 2016–2020 to 25% in 2021–2026, most spending is going into mitigation, not adaptation (Berkhout et al., 2015; Hanger et al., 2015; EEA, 2020a)."

Yet, the requirement for fiscal consolidation that will be needed after the COVID-19 pandemic (Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7) may also lead to a cessation of adaptation spending, as evidenced by the expenditure drop in coastal protection in Spain after the financial crisis in 2008 (López-Dóriga et al., 2020). Governments can shift the financial burden to beneficiaries of adaptation, as suggested, for example, for coastal protection and riverine flooding (Jongman et al., 2014; Penning-Rowsell and Priest, 2015; Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018). There is also an increase in financial mechanisms to accelerate private adaptation actions, including adaptation loans, subsidies, direct investments and novel public–private arrangements. For example, the European Investment Bank created a finance facility to support European regions through loans to implement adaptation projects (EEA, 2020a)."

The European Central Bank, the European Systemic Risk Board, and several national central banks in NEU and WCE have started to systematically assess the consequences of climate risks for financial stability and plan to integrate climate stress testing into their supervisory tools (Batten et al., 2016; ECB, 2021a; ECB, 2021b)."

Climate networks (e.g., Covenant of Mayors), funding (e.g., Climate-KIC), research programmes (e.g., Horizon Europe), European and national legislation, international treaties and the identification of co-benefits contribute to the prioritisation of climate action in European cities (Heidrich et al., 2016; Reckien et al., 2018; CDP, 2020). Still, mitigation and adaptation remain largely siloed and sectoral (Heidrich et al., 2016; Reckien et al., 2018; Grafakos et al., 2020). An assessment of the integration of mitigation and adaptation in urban climate-change action plans in Europe found only 147 cases in a representative sample of 885 cities (Reckien et al., 2018)."

Nature-based Solutions, such as urban greening, often integrate adaptation and mitigation in sustainable urban developments and are associated with increasing natural and social capital in urban communities, improving health and well-being, and raising property prices (Geneletti and Zardo, 2016; Pasimeni et al., 2019; Grafakos et al., 2020). Barriers to CRD in European cities include limitations in: funding, local capacity, guidance documents and quantified information on costs, co-benefits and trade-offs (Grafakos et al., 2020). Pilot projects are used to initiate CRD transitions (Nagorny-Koring and Nochta, 2018).

wg2_ch13_box-13.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Malmö (population 300,000):  Since the 1990s, Malmö has been transitioning towards an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable city, investing in eco-districts (redeveloped areas that integrate and showcase the city’s sustainability strategies) and adopting ambitious adaptation and mitigation targets. The city has focused on energy-efficient buildings and construction, collective and low-carbon transportation, and green spaces and infrastructure (Anderson, 2014; Malmo Stad, 2018). Malmö has developed creative implementation mechanisms, including a ‘climate contract’ between the city, the energy distributor and the water and waste utility to co-develop the climate-smart district, Hyllie (Isaksson and Heikkinen, 2018; Kanters and Wall, 2018; Parks, 2019). Flagship eco-districts play a central role in the city’s transition, in the wider adoption of CRD and in securing implementation partners (Isaksson and Heikkinen, 2018; Stripple and Bulkeley, 2019). The city has also leveraged its status as a CRD leader to attract investment. The private sector views CRD as profitable, due to the high demand and competitive value of these developments (Holgersen and Malm, 2015). Malmö adopted the SDGs as local goals and the city’s Comprehensive Plan is evaluated based on them, for example, considering gender in the use, access and safety of public spaces, and emphasising development that facilitates climate-resilient lifestyles (Malmo Stad, 2018). Malmö also engages stakeholders via dialogue with residents, collaboration with universities and partnerships with industry and service providers (Kanters and Wall, 2018; Parks, 2019). Despite measurable and monitored targets, and supportive institutional arrangements, sustainability outcomes for the flagship districts have been tempered by developers’ market-oriented demands (Holgersen and Malm, 2015; Isaksson and Heikkinen, 2018) and there is limited low-income housing in climate-resilient districts (Anderson, 2014; Holgersen and Malm, 2015)."

The Climate and Air Plan (CAP) and the city’s Master Plan (Comune di Milano, 2019) focus on low-carbon, inclusive and equitable development. The CAP is directed at municipal and private assets, and individual- to city-scale actions. In 2020, Milan released a revised Adaptation Plan and the Open Streets Project to ensure synergies between the COVID-19 response and longer-term CRD. Examples include strengthening neighbourhood-scale disaster response and reallocating street space for walking and cycling (Comune di Milano, 2020). Milan emphasises institutionalisation of CRD via a dedicated resilience department, and through active participation in climate networks and projects that support learning and exchange. Climate network commitments are cited in the city’s Master Plan and CAP guidelines as driving more ambitious deadlines and emissions targets (Comune di Milano, 2019). Implementation of Milan’s plans remains a challenge, despite dedicated resources and commitment."
wg2_ch13_13.11.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Within the private sector, there tends to be a preference for ‘soft’ (e.g., knowledge generation) than ‘hard’ (e.g., infrastructure) adaptation measures (Goldstein et al., 2019), in contrast to government-led responses typically favouring hard measures (Pranzini et al., 2015). However, there also remains diversity across sectors and organisations in the degree and type of adaptation response (Trawöger, 2014; Dannevig and Hovelsrud, 2016; Ray et al., 2017; Ricart et al., 2019). Whereas some sectors, such as flood management, banking and insurance, and energy (Bank of England, 2015; Gasbarro and Pinkse, 2016; Bank of England, 2019; Botzen et al., 2019), have generally made moderate progress on adaptation planning across Europe, there are key vulnerable economic sectors that are in earlier stages, including aviation (Burbidge, 2018), ports and shipping (Becker et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2018), and ICT (high confidence) (EEA, 2018b). There is also some evidence of ‘short-sighted’ adaptation or maladaptation; for example, in winter tourism there is a preference for technical and reactive solutions (e.g., artificial snow) that will not be sufficient under high levels of warming (Section 13.6.1.4)."
wg2_ch13_13.11.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Where adaptation is considered by companies, it is typically triggered either by the experience of extreme weather events that led to business disruptions (McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2019) or is included into corporate risk management in response to regulatory, shareholder or customer pressure (Averchenkova et al., 2016; Gasbarro et al., 2017). For instance, following the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure by the European Commission in 2019, 50 publicly listed companies revealed their exposure to their physical climate risks in 2020 (CDSB, 2020). But even if companies experience extreme weather events or stakeholder pressure, they may not adapt because they underestimate their vulnerability (Table 13.1; Pinkse and Gasbarro, 2019). For example, key barriers to adaptation among Greek firms include both external (e.g., lack of support and/or guidance) and internal factors (e.g., few resources, managerial perceptions) (Halkos et al., 2018). Lack of knowledge, feeling climate change is not a salient risk, and lack of social learning or collaboration appear to be key barriers to private-sector adaptation (Section 13.1 6.2.2; Dinca et al., 2014; André et al., 2017; Romagosa and Pons, 2017; Esteve et al., 2018; Luís et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2018).

Householders’ risk perception and concern about climate change fluctuates in response to media coverage and significant weather or sociopolitical events (high confidence) (Capstick et al., 2015). On average across Europe, and particularly in relation to gradual change, compared with experts, non-experts continue to underestimate climate-change risks (medium confidence) (Taylor et al., 2014), have low awareness of adaptation options, and confuse adaptation and mitigation (Harcourt, 2019), suggesting a need for improved climate literacy among the public. Indeed, fostering learning and coping capacity supports robust adaptation pathways (Jäger et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch13_13.11.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"There is strong public support for adaptation policy (e.g., building flood defences), particularly within the UK, France, Norway and Germany (Doran et al., 2018). Although, in some cases such public adaptation can undermine motivation for householders to take adaptation measures (Section 13.2), public adaptation can also increase householder motivations, with perceived efficacy of action a strong predictor of adaptation (high confidence) (Moser, 2014; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). However, there are also structural and economic barriers to household adaptation due to lack of policy incentives or regulations. For example, water-saving devices in homes could halve consumption, but lack of economic benefits to householders are barriers to adoption; and lack of standards as well as societal hesitation may explain low levels of water reuse in Europe (Section 13.2; EEA, 2017b). Conversely, water meters and higher tariffs have been found to reduce water consumption only in combination with other measures (EEA, 2017b; Bryan et al., 2019)."

Adaptation responses across European regions and sectors are more often incremental than transformative (medium confidence), with possible exceptions including water-related examples in, for example, the Netherlands (Section 13.2.2) and some cities (see Box 13.3). Transformative options may be better able to exploit new opportunities and co-benefits (see Box 13.3; Cross-Chapter Box HEALTH in Chapter 7; EEA, 2019a). Transitions towards more adaptive and climate-resilient systems are often the result of responses to crises which create windows of opportunity for systemic changes (Chapter 18; Johannessen et al., 2019). This includes extreme weather events, financial crises, for example in Malmö (Anderson, 2014; Isaksson and Heikkinen, 2018), and the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Milan), all of which have disrupted the status quo and accelerated innovation and implementation (e.g., Milan; see Box 13.3; Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7)."

For example, near-term and sectoral decision-making constrains transformative options for water-related risks (Section 13.2). Breaking through these lock-ins requires substantive (i.e., political) will, (un)learning of practices, resources, and evidence of what works. Trade-offs exist between the depth, scope and pace of change in transitioning from one system to another, suggesting that designing system transformations is a delicate balancing act (Termeer et al., 2017). Aspiring in-depth and comprehensive transformational changes might create a consensus framework to which to aspire, but it might not offer concrete perspectives to act on the ground. Taking small steps and quick wins offer an alternative pathway (Termeer and Dewulf, 2018)."

In terms of synergies, analysis of the Russian NAP found that successful completion of the NAP’s first phase could lead to significant progress towards 15 of the 17 goals (Bogdanovich and Lipka, 2020). European water adaptation (e.g., flood protection) can similarly support freshwater provision; and water-secured environments support socioeconomic growth (Sadoff et al., 2015) since people and assets tend to accumulate in areas protected from flooding and supplied with water, reducing the incentive for autonomous adaptation (de Moel et al., 2011; Hartmann and Spit, 2016; Di Baldassarre et al., 2018). In health, behavioural measures to reduce mental health impacts (e.g., gardening, active travel) can have broader health benefits (SDG 3) as well as help reduce emissions (Section 13.7; SDGs 7 and 13). Conversely, growing use of air conditioning for humans and livestock represents a potential trade-off between adaptation and mitigation (Sections 13.5–13.7, 13.10). As noted in Section 13.8, addressing poverty (SDG 1)–including energy poverty (SDG 7) and hunger (SDG 2); and addressing inequalities (SDG 10), including gender inequality (SDG 5)–improves resilience to climate impacts for those groups that are disproportionately affected (women, low-income and marginalised groups). Also, more inclusive and fair decision making can enhance resilience (SDG 16; Section 13.4.4), although adaptation measures may also lead to resource conflicts (SDG 16; Section 13.7).

Figure 13.36 summarises the synergies between adaptation and SDGs as identified by 167 European cities in 2019; particularly prominent are reported biodiversity and health benefits most often arising from societal (e.g., informational) and structural (e.g., technological and/or engineering) measures.
