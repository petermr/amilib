wg2_ch09_9.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter assesses the scientific evidence on observed and projected climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation options in Africa. The assessment refers to five African sub-regions—north, west, central, east and southern—closely following the African Union (AU), but including Mauritania in west Africa and Sudan in north Africa because much of the literature assessed places these countries in these regions (Figure 9.1). Madagascar and other island states are addressed in Chapter 15."
wg2_ch09_9.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,The contribution of Africa is among the lowest of historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for human-induced climate change and it has the lowest per capita GHG emissions of all regions currently (high confidence) (Figure 9.2). Yet Africa has already experienced widespread impacts from human-induced climate change (high confidence) (Figure 9.2; see Table 9.1).
wg2_ch09_9.1.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5 (Assessment Report 5), there have been notable policy changes in Africa and globally. The Paris Agreement, 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Sendai Framework and Agenda 2063 emphasise interlinked aims to protect the planet, reduce disaster risk, end poverty and ensure all people enjoy peace and prosperity (AU, 2015; UNFCCC Paris Agreement, 2015; UNISDR Sendai Framework, 2015; United Nations General Assembly, 2015). To match these interlinked ambitions, this chapter assesses risks and response options both for individual sectors and cross-sectorally to assess how risks can compound and cascade across sectors, as well as the potential feasibility and effectiveness, co-benefits and trade-offs and potential for maladaptation from response options (Simpson et al., 2021b; Williams et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Based on an analysis of 1022 mentions of Africa or African countries across the three AR6 Special Reports, the following main conclusions emerged."
wg2_ch09_9.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"In many parts of southern, east and west Africa, temperature or precipitation trends since the 1950s are attributable to human-caused climate change and several studies document the impacts of these climate trends on human and natural systems (high confidence) (Figure 9.5; Sections 9.5.6; 9.5.7). Nevertheless, research into attribution of trends to human-caused climate change or climate impacts remains scarce for multiple regions, especially in north and central Africa. This illustrates an ‘attribution gap’ where robust evidence for attributable impacts is twice as prevalent in high- compared to low-income countries globally (Callaghan et al., 2021). Most studies on climate impacts in Africa have focused on terrestrial ecosystems or water, with fewer on marine ecosystems, agriculture, migration, and health and well-being (Callaghan et al., 2021). Specific factors driving these knowledge gaps include limited data collection, data access and research funding for African researchers (see next section)."
wg2_ch09_9.1.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there have been rapid advances in climate impact research due to increased computing power, data access and new developments in statistical analysis (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016). However, sparse and intermittent weather station data limit attribution of climate trends to human-caused climate change for large areas of Africa, especially for precipitation and extreme events, and hinder more accurate climate change projections (Section 9.5.2; Figure 9.5; Otto et al., 2020). Outside of South Africa and Kenya, digitally accessible data on biodiversity is limited (Meyer et al., 2015). Lack of comprehensive socioeconomic data also limits researchers’ ability to predict climate change impacts. Ideally, multiple surveys over time are needed to identify effects of a location’s changing climate on changing socioeconomic conditions. Twenty-five African countries conducted only one nationally representative survey that could be used to construct measures of poverty during 2000–2010 and 14 conducted none over this period (Jean et al., 2016). Because of these challenges, much of what is known about climate impacts and risks in Africa relies on evidence from global studies that use data largely from outside Africa (e.g., Zhao et al., 2021). These studies generate estimates of average impacts across the globe, but may not have the statistical power to distinguish whether African nations display differential vulnerability, exposure or adaptive capacity. In sections of this chapter, we have relied, when necessary, on such studies, as they often provide best available evidence for Africa. Increasing data coverage and availability would increase the ability to discern important differences in risk both among and within African countries."
wg2_ch09_9.1.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate-related research in Africa faces severe funding constraints with unequal funding relationships between countries and with research partners in Europe and North America (high confidence). Based on analysis of over 4 million research grants from 521 funding organisations globally, it is estimated that, from 1990–2020, USD 1.26 billion funded Africa-related research on climate impacts, mitigation and adaptation. This represents only 3.8% of global funding for climate-related research—a figure incommensurate with Africa’s high vulnerability to climate change (see Figure 9.3; Box 9.1; Chapter 8 Figure 8.6; Overland et al., 2021). Almost all funding for Africa-related climate research originates outside Africa and goes to research institutions outside Africa (Blicharska et al., 2017; Bendana, 2019; Siders, 2019; Overland et al., 2021). From 1990–2020, 78% of funding for Africa-related climate research flowed to institutions in Europe and the USA—only 14.5% flowed to institutions in Africa (Figure 9.3; Overland et al., 2021). Kenya (2.3% of total funding) and South Africa (2.2%) are the only African countries among the top 10 countries in the world in terms of hosting institutions receiving funding for climate-related research on Africa (Overland et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.1.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"These unequal funding relations influence inequalities in climate-related research design, participation and dissemination between African researchers and researchers from high-income countries outside Africa, in ways that can reduce adaptive capacity in Africa (very high confidence). Those empowered to shape research agendas can shape research answers: climate research agendas, skills gaps and eligible researchers are frequently defined by funding agencies, often from a global north perspective (Vincent et al., 2020a). Larger funding allocations for research focused on Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia are reflected in higher concentrations of empirical research on impacts and adaptation options in these countries, and there is a general lack of adaptation research for multiple of the most vulnerable countries in Africa (Figure 9.4) (Callaghan et al., 2021; Overland et al., 2021; Sietsma et al., 2021; Vincent and Cundill, 2021). The combination of northern-led identification of both knowledge and skills gaps can result in projects where African partners are positioned primarily as recipients engaged to support research and/or have their ‘capacity built’ rather than also leading research projects on an equal basis (Vincent et al., 2020a; Trisos et al., 2021). Analysis of >15,000 climate change publications found for over 75% of African countries 60–100% of climate change publications on these countries did not include a single local author, with authorship dominated by researchers from richer countries outside Africa (Pasgaard et al., 2015). This can reduce adaptive capacity in Africa as researchers at global north institutions may shape research questions and outputs for a northern audience rather than providing actionable insights on priority issues for African partners (Pasgaard et al., 2015; Nago and Krott, 2020). Moreover, in order to access research publications in a timely manner, many researchers in Africa are forced to use shadow websites bypassing journal paywalls (Bohannon, 2016). Ways to enhance research partnerships to produce actionable insights on climate impacts and solutions in Africa include: increased funding from African and non-African sources, increasing direct control of resources for African partners, having African research and user priorities set research questions, identify skills gaps, and lead research, and having open access policies for research outputs (ESPA Directorate, 2018; Vogel et al., 2019; Vincent et al., 2020a; IDRC, 2021; Trisos et al., 2021)."

Loss and damage arise from adverse climate-related impacts and risks from both sudden-onset events, such as floods and cyclones, and slower-onset processes, including droughts, sea level rise, glacial retreat and desertification and include both include both economic (e.g., loss of assets and crops) and non-economic types (e.g., loss of biodiversity, heritage and health) (UNFCCC Paris Agreement, 2015; IPCC, 2018a; Mechler et al., 2020). Sections marked with * and in bold highlight Loss and Damage attributed to human-induced climate change (16.1.3)."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"A key risk is defined as a potentially severe risk. In line with AR5, ‘severity’ relates to dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, the prevention of which is the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as stated in its Article 2 (Oppenheimer et al., 2014). The process for identifying key risks for Africa included reviewing risks from Niang et al. (2014) and assessing new evidence on observed impacts and projected risks in this chapter."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several key risks were identified for both ecosystems and people including species extinction and ecosystem disruption, loss of food production, reduced economic output and increased poverty, increased disease and loss of human life, increased water and energy insecurity, loss of natural and cultural heritage and compound extreme events harming human settlements and critical infrastructure (Table 9.2). In order to provide a sector- and continent-level perspective, the key risks aggregate across different regions and combine multiple risks within sectors. For detailed assessments of observed impacts and future risks within each sector and each sub-region of Africa, see the sector-specific sections of this chapter (Sections 9.6 to 9.12)."

wg2_ch09_9.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Several expert elicitation workshops of lead and contributing authors were held to develop ‘burning embers’ assessing how risk increases with further global warming for a subset of key risks, specifically risk of food production losses, risk of biodiversity loss and risk of mortality and morbidity from heat and infectious disease (Figure 9.6). These key risks were selected in part because of underlying assessment work in the chapter to connect multiple studies to observed impacts and/or risk at increasing global warming levels (Sections 9.6.2; 9.8.2; 9.8.5.2; 9.10.2)."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"All three of these key risks are assessed to have already transitioned completely into moderate risk—that is, negative impacts have been detected and attributed to climate change—before the 2010–2020 level of global warming (1.09°C) above pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2021), with medium confidence for increased mortality and morbidity and high confidence for losses of food productivity and biodiversity (Figure 9.6). For biodiversity, these impacts include repeated mass die-offs of coral reefs due to marine heat (Section 9.6.1.4), reductions in lake productivity due to warming (Section 9.6.1.3), and woody encroachment of grasslands and savannas due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Section 9.6.1.1), with negative impacts on livelihoods (Section 9.6.2). For food production, climate change impacts include up to 5.8% mean reduction in maize productivity due to increased temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa (Sections 9.8.2.1; 9.8.2.2) and reduced fisheries catches due to increased temperatures, especially in tropical regions (Section 9.8.2). For health, climate change impacts include increased mortality and morbidity from changes in the distribution and incidence of malaria and cholera and the direct effects of increasing temperatures (Section 9.10.2)."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"In scenarios with low adaptation (that is largely localised and incremental), the transition to high risk—widespread and severe impacts—has already begun at the current level of global warming for biodiversity loss (high confidence), and begins below 1.5°C global warming for both food production (medium confidence) and mortality and morbidity from heat and infectious disease (high confidence). Across all risks, the best estimate for the transition to high risk is at 1.5°C of global warming, with transition to high risk completing before 2°C (Figure 9.6). Projected impacts considered high risk around 1.5°C include: across more than 90% of Africa, more than 10% of species are at risk of local extinction (Figure 9.6; Table 9.1); the further expansion of woody plants into grass-dominated biomes (Section 9.6.2.1); 9% declines in maize yield for west Africa and 20–60% decline in wheat yield for southern and northern Africa, as well as declines in coffee and tea in east Africa and sorghum in west Africa (Figures 9.22; 9.23; Sections 9.8.2.1; 9.8.2.2), and >12% decline in marine fisheries catch potential for multiple west African countries, potentially leaving millions at risk of nutritional deficiencies (Figure 9.25; Section 9.8.5); tens of millions more people exposed to vector-borne diseases in east and southern Africa (malaria), and north, east and southern Africa (dengue, zika), increased risk of malnutrition in central, east and west Africa, and more than 15 additional deaths per 100,000 annually due to heat in parts of west, east and north Africa (Figures 9.32; 9.35; Sections 9.10.2; 9.9.4.1)."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"The transition from high to very high risk—that is severe and widespread impacts with limited ability to adapt—begins either at or just below 2°C for all three risks (Figure 9.6). The assessed temperature range for the transition to very high risk is wider for food production than for biodiversity and health. Projected impacts for food include: 10–30% decline in marine fisheries catch potential for the Horn of Africa region and southern Africa and more than 30% decline for west Africa at 2°C global warming, with greater declines at higher levels of warming (Section 9.8.2). Beyond 2°C global warming, over 50% of commercially important freshwater fish species across Africa are projected to be vulnerable to extinction (Figure 9.26). Between 2°C and 4°C, wheat, maize and rice yields are projected, on average, to be lower than 2005 yields across all regions of Africa. From 2°C global warming, over 40% losses in rangeland productivity are projected for western Africa. By 3.75°C, severe heat stress may be near year-round for cattle across tropical Africa (Figure 9.24). Multiple countries in west, central and east Africa are projected to be at risk from simultaneous negative impacts on crops, fisheries and livestock (Sections 9.8.2; 9.8.5; Thiault et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"The best estimate for the onset of very high risk for biodiversity and health is at 2.1°C. Projected impacts considered very high risk for biodiversity include potential destabilisation of the African tropical forest carbon sink, risk of local extinction of more than 50% of plants, vertebrate and insect species across one-fifth of Africa, 7–18% of African species at risk of total extinction including, a third of freshwater fish, and more than 90% warm-water coral reefs lost (Section 9.6.2). For health, projected impacts considered high risk include potentially lethal heat exposure for more than 100 days per year in west, central and east Africa, with more than 50 additional heat-related deaths per 100,000 annually across large parts of Africa, and hundreds of millions more people exposed to extreme heat in cities (Section 9.5; 9.10.2; 9.9.4.1; Figure 9.35), tens to hundreds of thousands of additional cases of diarrhoeal disease in east, central and west Africa, and tens of millions more people exposed to mosquito-borne arboviruses like dengue or zika in north, east and southern Africa (Section 9.10.2)."
wg2_ch09_9.2_p11,NO_TITLE,The feasibility and effectiveness of existing adaptation options under current levels of warming are assessed in Section 9.10.2 and adaptation options considering future levels of warming are assessed in the chapter section for each sector.
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Based on a systematic assessment of observed climate adaptation responses in the scientific literature covering 827 adaptation response types in 553 studies (2013–2021), and expert elicitation process, 24 categories of adaptation responses in Africa were identified (Williams et al., 2021; Figure 9.7). This assessment excluded autonomous adaptation in ecosystems, such as migration and evolution of animal and plant species."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"At the current global warming level, 83% of adaptation response categories assessed showed medium potential for risk reduction (that is, mixed evidence of effectiveness). Bulk water infrastructure (including managed aquifer recharge, dams, pipelines, pump stations, water treatment plants and distribution networks), human migration, financial investment for sustainable agriculture, and social infrastructure (including decentralised management, strong community structures and informal support networks) show high potential for risk reduction (high evidence of option’s effectiveness) (Sections 9.6.4; 9.7.3; Boxes 9.8; 9.9; 9.10; 9.11). However, there was limited evidence to assess the continued effectiveness of these options at higher global warming levels (Williams et al., 2021) with some options, such as bulk water infrastructure (particularly large dams), expected to face increasing risk with continued warming with damages cascading to other sectors (see Box 9.5), while others, such as crop irrigation and adjusting planting times, may increasingly reach adaptation limits above 1.5°C and 2°C global warming (Sections 9.8.3; 9.8.4)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"The majority of adaptation studies were in west and east Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania), followed by southern Africa, with the least coming from central and north Africa (Figure 9.7; Williams et al., 2021). Most studies were on adaptation actions in the food sector, with the least on health (Figure 9.7). The five adaptation response categories with the highest number of reported actions were sustainable water management (food sector), resilient infrastructure and technologies (health sector), agricultural intensification (food sector), human migration (poverty and livelihoods) and crop management (food sector)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"No adaptation response categories were assessed to have high feasibility of implementation. Technological barriers dominate factors limiting implementation (92% of adaptation categories have low technological feasibility) followed by institutional barriers (71% of adaptation categories have low institutional feasibility). This assessment matches review studies finding institutional responses to be least common in Africa and highlight inadequate institutional capacities as key limits to human adaptation (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18). Feasibility is higher for the social dimension of adaptation responses (with moderate feasibility for 88% of categories). The largest evidence gap is for environmental feasibility for which 67% could not be assessed due to insufficient evidence (Figure 9.7)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Sustainable Water Management (SWM) includes rainwater harvesting for irrigation, watershed restoration, water conservation practices (e.g., efficient irrigation) and less water-intensive cropping (also see Section 9.8.3), and was the most reported adaptation response in the food sector. SWM was assessed with medium economic and social feasibility and low environmental, institutional and technological feasibility. The feasibility of this adaptation category may depend largely on socioeconomic conditions (Amamou et al., 2018; Harmanny and Malek, 2019; Schilling et al., 2020), as many African farmers cannot afford the cost of SWM facilities (Section 9.8.4)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Resilient Infrastructure and Technologies (RIT) for health include improved housing to limit exposure to climate hazards (Stringer et al., 2020), and improved water quality, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure (e.g., technology across all sectors to prevent contamination and pollution of water, improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) approaches such as promotion of diverse water sources for water supply, improving health infrastructure) (Section 9.10.3). Overall, RIT had medium social feasibility and low institutional and technological feasibility. Bulk water infrastructure was assessed to have high effectiveness, but low institutional and technological feasibility. Increasing variability in climate and environmental challenges has made sustainable and resilient infrastructure design a key priority (Minsker et al., 2015). RIT is, however, generally new in the African context (Cumming et al., 2017) and that may be why there is limited evidence to assess some of its dimensions (economic and environmental feasibility). Construction of resilient public water infrastructures that include safeguards for sanitation and hygiene are expensive and, across national and local levels, planning for its construction poses multiple challenges (Choko et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Sustainable agricultural intensification in smallholder farming systems (especially agroecological approaches, such as mixed cropping, mixed farming, no soil disturbance, and mulching) and agroforestry are key response options to secure food for the growing African population (Nziguheba et al., 2015; Ritzema et al., 2017). Yet many of these options currently face low institutional and technological feasibility (Figure 9.7). Social and economic feasibility is higher, but barriers include high cost of farm inputs (land, capital and labour), lack of access to timely weather information and lack of water resources can make this option quite challenging for African smallholder farmers (Sections 9.8.1; 9.11.4; Kihila, 2017; Williams et al., 2019b)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Crop management includes adjusting crop choices, planting times, or the size, type and location of planted areas (Altieri et al., 2015; Nyagumbo et al., 2017; Dayamba et al., 2018). This option faces environmental, institutional and technological barriers to feasibility. Social and economic barriers to implementation are fewer. Factors such as tenure and ownership rights, labour requirements, high investment costs and lack of skills and knowledge on how to use the practices are reported to hinder implementation of crop management options by smallholder farmers (Muller and Shackleton, 2013; Nyasimi et al., 2017). For instance, when improved seed varieties are available, high price limits access for rural households (Amare et al., 2018; see Sections 9.8.3; 9.8.4)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Human migration was assessed to have high potential for risk reduction (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7, Box 9.8; Rao et al., 2019; Sitati et al., 2021). However, it had low feasibility for economic, institutional and technological dimensions, with limited evidence on environmental feasibility. Institutional factors such as the implementation of top-down policies have been reported as limiting options for coping locally, resulting in migration (Brockhaus et al., 2013). Limited financial and technical support for migration limits the extent to which it can make meaningful contributions to climate resilience (Djalante et al., 2013; Trabacchi and Mazza, 2015). International and domestic remittances are an important resource that can help aid recovery from climate shocks, but inadequate finance and banking infrastructure can limit cash transfers (Box 9.8). Male migration can increase burdens of household and agricultural work, especially for women (Poudel et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). The more agency migrants have (that is, degree of voluntarity and freedom of movement), the greater the potential benefits for sending and receiving areas (high agreement, medium evidence) (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7; Box 9.8)"

However, designing adaptation policy under conditions of scarcity, common to many African countries, can inadvertently lead to trade-offs between adaptation options, as well as between adaptation and mitigation options, can reinforce inequality, and fail to address underlying social vulnerabilities (Kuhl, 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation options, such as access to climate information, provision of climate information services, growing of early maturing varieties, agroforestry systems, agricultural diversification and growing of drought-resistant varieties of crops may deliver co-benefits, providing synergies that result in positive outcomes. For instance, in sub-Saharan African drylands including northern Ghana and Burkina Faso and large parts of the Sahel, migration as a result of unfavourable environmental conditions closely linked to climate change has often provided opportunities for farmers to earn income (SDG 1) and mitigate the effects of climate-related fluctuations in crop and livestock productivity (SDG 2) (Zampaligré et al., 2014; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018; Wiederkehr et al., 2018).

In Kenya and Tanzania, small-scale irrigation provides employment opportunities and income to both farmers and private businesses (SDGs 8 and 9) (Lefore et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2021c). Land management practices including the use of fertilizers and mulching have also been highlighted as adaptation options improving soil fertility for better yields (SDG 2) and delivering opportunities to reduce the climate change effects (SDG 13) (Muchuru and Nhamo, 2019)."

CSA practices including conservation agriculture, access to climate information, agroforestry systems, drip irrigation, planting pits and erosion control techniques (Partey et al., 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2021) can improve soil fertility, increase yield and household food security (Zougmoré et al., 2016; Zougmoré et al., 2018), thereby contributing to the realisation of SDG 2 in Africa (Mbow et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch09_9.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"In contrast, adaptation actions may induce trade-offs with mitigation objectives, as well as other adaptation and developmental outcomes, delivering negative impacts and compromising the attainment of the SDGs. For example, increased deployment of renewable energy technologies can drive future land use changes (Frank et al., 2021) and threaten important biodiversity areas if poorly deployed (Rehbein et al., 2020). The use of early maturing or drought-tolerant crop varieties may increase resilience (SDGs 1, 2), but adoption by smallholder farmers can also be hindered by affordability of seed. Cultivation of biodiesel crops also can hinder food security (SDG 2) at local and national levels (Tankari, 2017; Brinkman et al., 2020). Additionally, the use of fertilizers in intense systems can result in increased environmental degradation (Akinyi et al., 2021). When farmers migrate, it puts pressure on inadequate social services provision and facilities at their destination (SDG 8) and leads to reduced farm labour and a deterioration of the workforce and assets (SDG 2) (Gemenne and Blocher, 2017a), which negatively affects farm operations and non-migrants, particularly women, elderly and children, at the point of origin (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015; Ahmed et al., 2016; Otto et al., 2017; Eastin, 2018). Farmers may also miss critical periods during the farming season that eventually makes them food insecure (SDG 2) and vulnerable to climate change (SDG 13) (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018). Migrants should be supported to reduce their overall shocks to climate vulnerability at the points of origin and destination. Small-scale irrigation infrastructure if not managed properly, may lead to negative environmental effects and compromise the integrity of riparian ecosystems (SDG 15) (Loucks and van Beek, 2017) and serve as breeding grounds for malaria-causing mosquitoes (SDG 3) (Attu and Adjei, 2018)."

It emphasises equity as a core element of sustainable development as well as conditions for inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent work for all, taking into account different levels of national development and capacities as encoded in the SDGs (Section 9.3.2; Chapter 18 Section 18.1).

Since the Copenhagen Accord (UNFCCC, 2009), and then extended by the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC Paris Agreement, 2015 see Article 4.4, and also 4.8, 4.9), developed countries are expected to scale up climate finance for developing countries toward a collective goal of USD 100 billion per year by 2020, with a balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation."
wg2_ch09_9.4.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is limited research providing quantitative estimates of adaptation costs across Africa. Adaptation costs in Africa have been estimated at USD 7–15 billion per year by 2020 (Schaeffer et al., 2013), corresponding to USD 5–11 per capita per year. The African Development Bank estimates costs of near-term adaptation needs identified in the Intended NDCs (INDCs) of African countries as USD 7.4 billion per year from 2020, recognising INDCs describe only a limited subset of adaptation needs (AfDB, 2019). Many African countries, particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs), express a stronger demand for adaptation finance—a study of financial demands in INDCs for 16 African countries suggests a ratio around 2:1 for adaptation to mitigation finance with demand for Eritrea and Uganda approximately 80% for adaptation (Zhang and Pan, 2016)."

Adaptation cost estimates for Africa increase from USD 20–50 billion per year for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 in 2050 (around 1.5°C of warming), to USD 18–60 billion per year for just over 2°C, to USD 100–437 billion per year for 4°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels (Schaeffer et al., 2013; UNEP, 2015; Chapagain et al., 2020). Focusing on individual sectors, the average country-level cost is projected to be USD 0.8 billion per year for adapting to temperature-related mortality under 4°C global warming (Carleton et al., 2018), with cumulative energy costs for cooling demand projected to reach USD 51 billion by 2°C and USD 486 billion by 4°C global warming (Parkes et al., 2019). Transport infrastructure repair costs are also projected to be substantial (Section 9.8.2) More precise estimates are limited by methodological difficulties and data gaps for costing adaptation, uncertainties about future levels of global warming and associated climate hazards, and ethical choices such as the desired level of protection achieved (Fankhauser, 2010; Hallegatte et al., 2018; UNFCCC, 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17).

The Global Commission on Adaptation estimated the benefits and costs of five illustrative investments and found benefit–cost ratios ranging from 2:1 to 10:1. However, it also noted that ‘actual returns depend on many factors, such as economic growth and demand, policy context, institutional capacities and condition of assets’ (The Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019). A review of ex-ante cost–benefit analyses for 19 adaptation-focused projects in Africa financed by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) shows benefit–cost ratios in a similar range. Using a 10% discount rate, as used by many of GCF’s accredited entities, the benefit–cost ratio for individual projects ranges from 0.9:1 to 7.3:1, the median benefit–cost ratio is 1.8:1 and total ratio across all 19 projects is 2.6:1. When using lower discount rates, as some entities do for climate projects, the benefit–cost ratio is even higher, reflecting the front-loaded costs and back-loaded benefits of many adaptation investments. Using a 5% discount rate, the overall benefit–cost ratio of the GCF projects is 3.5:1, with a range from 1:1 to 11.5:1 and a median ratio of 2.4:1 (Breitbarth, 2020). In addition, many proposals have activities for which further benefits were not estimated due to the difficulty of attributing benefits directly to the intervention. The benefits of adaptation measures for infrastructure and others with clear market impacts are often easier to estimate than for policy interventions and where markets may not exist, such as ecosystem services (Li et al., 2014)."

These disbursement ratios for adaptation and mitigation finance in Africa are lower than the global average (Savvidou et al., 2021), which suggests greater capacity problems in implementing climate-related projects and, in turn, means lost opportunities to build resilience and adaptive capacity and a wider gap in adaptation finance for Africa (Omari-Motsumi et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The present situation reflects not only an insufficient level of finance being mobilised to support African adaptation needs (Section 9.4.1) but also problems in accessing and using funding that is available. The direct-access modality introduced by the Adaptation Fund and GCF, whereby national and regional entities from developing countries can be accredited to access funds directly, is aimed at reducing transaction costs for recipient countries, increasing national ownership and agency for adaptation actions, and enhancing decision-making responsibilities by national actors, thereby contributing to strengthening local capacity for sustained and transformational adaptation (CDKN, 2013; Masullo et al., 2015). Indeed, direct-access projects from the Adaptation Fund tend to be more community focused than indirect-access projects (Manuamorn and Biesbroek, 2020). Country institutions in Africa, however, are struggling to be accredited for direct access because of the complicated, lengthy and bureaucratic processes of accreditation, which requires, for example, strong institutional and fiduciary standards and capacity to be in place (Brown et al., 2013; Omari-Motsumi et al., 2019). As of December 2019, over 80% of all developing countries had no national direct access entities (DAEs) (Asfaw et al., 2019). Capacity to develop fundable projects in Africa is also inadequate. An analysis of proposals submitted to the GCF up to 2017 revealed that, while African countries were able to submit proposals to the GCF, they had the lowest percentage of approvals (39%) compared to all other regions (Fonta et al., 2018).

Systemic barriers have been highlighted in relation to the multilateral climate funds, including funds not providing full-cost adaptation funding, capacity barriers in the design and implementation of adaptation actions (including the development of fundable project proposals) and barriers in recognising and enabling the involvement of sub-national actors in the delivery and implementation of adaptation action (Omari-Motsumi et al., 2019).

While supporting readiness activities is important for strengthening country ownership and institutional development, research suggests adaptation finance needs to shift towards implementation of concrete projects and more pipeline development if the goal of transformative and sustained adaptation in Africa is to be realised (Fonta et al., 2018; Omari-Motsumi et al., 2019). The source of these problems needs to be better understood so that the prospects for future climate-related investments can be improved and institutional strengthening and targeted project preparation can be supported (Omari-Motsumi et al., 2019; Doshi and Garschagen, 2020; Savvidou et al., 2021)."

NAPs provide a means of developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those needs. In 2016, the parties agreed the GCF would fund up to USD 3 million per country for adaptation planning instruments, including NAPs. However, accessing funding through the GCF for NAP formulation is challenging (Fonta et al., 2018) and, as of October 2020, 4 years after the decision to fund NAPs, only six African countries had completed their NAPs (UNFCCC NAP central).

Further, adaptation planning involves cross-cutting themes, multiple actors and institutions with different objectives, jurisdictional authority and levels of power and resources, yet there is often a lack of coordination, clear leadership or governance mandates (Shackleton et al., 2015; Leck and Simon, 2018) and unequal power relations between African countries and developed countries can hinder progress on governance of financial markets, budget allocations and technology transfer to address addressing climate technology gaps in Africa (Rennkamp and Boyd, 2015; Olawuyi, 2018)."

Barriers to developing nexus approaches arise from rigid sectoral planning, regulatory and implementation procedures, entrenched interests, and power structures and established sectoral communication structures. Opportunities for overcoming these barriers include creating a dedicated home for co-development of nexus risk assessment and solutions, promoting co-leadership of projects by multiple sectors, specific budget allocations for nexus projects, facilitating and coordinating services, compiling useful strategies into toolkits, ameliorating inequitable power relations among participants and measuring progress on nexus approaches through metrics (Palmer et al., 2016; Baron et al., 2017)."

Natural resource security is increasingly reliant on transboundary governance, regional integration and cooperation (Namara and Giordano, 2017). There are 60 international or shared river basins on the continent, a function of colonial divides and topography, with some basins shared by four or more countries (UNECA, 2016; Popelka and Smith, 2020). Climate changes which result in impact and risk pathways across country boundaries and regions (although with different levels of impact) accelerate the urgency for integrated approaches to manage and benefit from shared resources and promote their security for populations and economies (Namara and Giordano, 2017; Frame et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2021).

Further, it can constrain access to critical financial resources at a time when it is needed most. This is particularly the case when climate impact pathways manifest at the transboundary level (Challinor et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2021b), but where the need to protect sovereign interests can block regionally integrated institutional arrangements that are pivotal for accessing the multilateral climate funds for transboundary climate investments that include resilient infrastructure and greater water benefits across Africa’s shared river basins (Cross-Chapter Box INTEREG in Chapter 16; Carter et al., 2021)."

Such risks are two-fold in nature, arising both from potential impacts due to climate change and from responses to climate change (Simpson et al., 2021b). This awareness among stakeholders is leading to increasingly progressive approaches to natural resource development that can also reduce risk across boundaries within regions. For example, river basin organisations in Southern Africa such as the Orange-Senqu and the Okavango River Basin Commissions are revising treaties considered to pre-date the interrelated issues of climate change, growing populations and water scarcity (OKACOM, 2020). In parts of west Africa, where climate change is characterised by reduction of precipitation (Barry et al., 2018), regionally integrated and climate-resilient economic investments for water resource development are enabled by the Senegal River Basin Organisation (OMVS) which emphasises programme and project development, financing and implementation in ensuing work plans (World Bank, 2020e), as does the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) in north and east Africa (Schmeier, 2017; Blumstein and Petersen-Perlman, 2021)."

Underlying governance issues and political economy interests block or advance such transitions to regionally integrated resource management and benefit-sharing, the market drivers of water security (AMCOW, 2012; Soliev et al., 2015). Angola, for example, outlines regional adaptation as a priority and one of its unconditional adaptation strategies (which is already funded) is enhancing resilience in the Benguela fisheries system, a project shared with Namibia and South Africa (GEF and FAO, 2021). Another example is The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative, which was launched in 2007 with the aim of tackling land degradation in Africa (UNCCD, 2020). This transboundary project, led by the African Union Commission, is being implemented in more than 20 countries across Africa’s Sahel region, in cooperation with international partners including UNCCD, GEF and the World Bank. Approximately USD 10 billion have been mobilised and/or promised for this initiative (UNCCD, 2020). Such statements demonstrate the increasing identification of transboundary risks and approaches to manage and adapt to them as areas of ‘common concern’ that require cooperative adaptation actions. Accelerating strengthened transboundary water and climate governance needs to integrate these climate drivers of compromised water security. The role of institutions such as OMVS and the NBI have demonstrated they can influence economic behaviour among riparian countries of shared river basins highlighting that institutions are an integral part of climate governance in evolving economic systems (Hodgson, 2000)."

The successful implementation of policy objectives across the continent is often contingent upon or at least supported by an underlying legislative framework (Averchenkova and Matikainen, 2017; Scotford et al., 2017). There are also wider systemic and structural reasons for developing climate change legislation, including the promotion of coordination within government, its policy entrenching role, its symbolic value and its potential to support climate finance flows (Nachmany et al., 2017; Scotford and Minas, 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Legal systems, however, also have the potential to be maladaptive. Laws may be brittle, often assuming and reinforcing a static state, and the boundary of the law may not align to the relevant location, scale or impact (Craig, 2010; Arnold and Gunderson, 2013; Wenta et al., 2019). This necessitates the review and revision of existing laws to remove such barriers and foster adaptive management (Craig, 2010; Ruhl, 2010; Cosens et al., 2017) and, where necessary, the promulgation of new laws."
wg2_ch09_9.4.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"There has been a rise in framework and sectoral climate change laws across Africa, as illustrated in Figure 9.10. The map illustrates the two framework statutes which have been promulgated in Benin and Kenya, as well as the three framework bills which have been drafted in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. There are also discussions taking place in Zimbabwe and Ghana regarding the potential development of a draft framework climate change bill. A review of the climate change framework laws indicates evidence of cross-pollination in design across African jurisdictions, creating the potential for a unique and regionally appropriate body of law with a strong focus on adaptation responses (Rumble, 2019). As discussed in Chapter 17, however, there remains the need for in-country expert input on how the domestic legal landscape may influence their operation, and for each jurisdiction to independently interrogate its adaptation needs and objectives (Scotford et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Numerous African states have also included dedicated climate change-related provisions within various existing statutes that regulate the environment or disaster management. For example, Tanzania’s Environmental Management Act 20 of 2004 contains dedicated provisions to address climate change. Rwanda’s Law on Environment 48/2018 also contains detailed provisions on mainstreaming climate change into development planning processes, education on climate change, vulnerability assessments and the promotion of measures to enhance adaptive capacity. Some countries have also developed laws dedicated to a specific aspect of adaptation. For example, the Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust of Seychelles Act 18 of 2015 establishes a trust fund to finance climate change adaptation responses in Seychelles. Similarly, many countries including Algeria, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Ghana, Namibia, Malawi, Mauritius, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa have dedicated disaster management laws. At this stage, it is still too early to determine whether these laws are having any substantive influence in strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability and, as discussed in Chapter 17, this is identified as a knowledge gap requiring further research."
wg2_ch09_9.4.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Laws are now being developed to formalise and entrench institutional structures, specifying their mandate, function, membership and related procedures. A useful example of such an approach can be found in the Nigerian Climate Change Bill which establishes the National Climate Council on Climate Change headed and chaired by the Vice-President, with a wide membership of ministers, the Chairmen of the Governors’ Forum and Association of Local Governments, as well as the private sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives."

wg2_ch09_9.4.4.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The Paris Agreement acknowledges, in Article 7.5, that adaptation should be based on and guided by, among other things, ‘traditional knowledge, knowledge of indigenous peoples and local knowledge systems’. The accumulated knowledge within Indigenous knowledge systems is particularly important as it can assist governments in determining how the climate is changing, how to characterise these impacts and provide lessons for adaptation (Salick and Ross, 2009). In this context, Indigenous knowledge systems can play an important role in the effective design of local laws (Mwanga, 2019), as well as national laws. Doing so can contribute to the success of climate change response strategies, including enhancing local participation and the implementation of community-based and ecosystem-based adaptations (Chanza and de Wit, 2016; Mwanga, 2019). For example, the Makorongo Village Forest Management By-Law in Tanzania codifies local customary practices relating to forest management and sustainable harvesting with associated dual adaptation and mitigation benefits and includes all villagers in the decision-making processes relating to forest management (Mwanga, 2019). The inclusion of beneficial Indigenous knowledge systems within local by-laws is contingent on the active involvement of members of the Indigenous community and awareness of climate change considerations within the local sphere of government, and a willingness to foster such practices (Mwanga, 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.4.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"In addition to the advancement of Indigenous knowledge in adaptive responses, it has been suggested that the protection of the rights of Indigenous Peoples can have adaptive benefits, in particular through the protection of land tenure rights (Ayanlade and Jegede, 2016). It has been argued that doing so will protect Indigenous Peoples’ lands and resources from overconsumption, secure the recognition of their cultural stewardship over the environment, provide the financial incentive for land stewardship and promote the application of their unique knowledge on the sustainable development of that land and its preservation (Jaksa, 2006; Ayanlade and Jegede, 2016). Not only can a lack of protection of Indigenous legal tenure undermine these objectives, but a number of African laws may actively work against them. For example, a review of Tanzanian and Zambian laws highlighted existing provisions that empowered the state to terminate or criminalise the occupation of vacant, undeveloped or fallow lands, which undermined the occupation by Indigenous peoples of forests and other uncultivated lands (Ayanlade and Jegede, 2016)."

Most CS investments have been towards the agricultural sector, with other focal sectors, including pastoralism, health, water, energy and disaster risk reduction, having only small CS initiatives directed towards them (Nkiaka et al., 2019; Carr et al., 2020). Despite this focus and investment, however, there remains a mismatch between the supply and uptake of CS in Africa as information is often inaccessible, unaffordable, not relevant to context or scale, and is poorly communicated (Singh et al., 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2021) (Table 9.4; Sections 9.4.1.5.1 and 9.13.4.1). Observational data required for effective regional CS, including trend analyses, seasonal climate assessment, modelling and model evaluation, is sparse and often of poor quality (Figure 9.11) and usually requires payment which renders it unaffordable (Winrock, 2018)."

Of these participants, across all socioeconomic strata, 71% of those who were aware of the concept of climate change agreed that it needs to be stopped, but only 51% expressed confidence about their ability to make a difference. East Africans (63%) were almost twice as likely as north Africans (35%) to report that the weather for growing crops had worsened. Additionally, people engaged in occupations related to agriculture (farming, fishing or forestry) were more likely to report negative weather effects (59%) than those with other livelihoods (45%) (Selormey et al., 2019).

Striking differences exist when comparing sub-national units within countries. Climate change literacy rates in Nigeria range from 71% in Kwara to 5% in Kano, and within Botswana from 69% in Lobatse to only 6% in Kweneng West (Simpson et al., 2021a).

Progress towards greater climate change literacy affords a concrete opportunity to mainstream climate change within core national and sub-national developmental agendas in Africa towards more CRD pathways. Synergies with CS can also overcome gendered deficits, for example, although women are generally less climate change aware and more vulnerable to climate change than men in Africa, they are generally more likely to adopt climate-resilient crops when they are climate change aware and have exposure to extension services (Acevedo et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2021a)."

There is a range of climate service providers in Africa, including primarily National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) and partner institutions, complemented by NGOs, the private sector and research institutions (Snow et al., 2016; Harvey et al., 2019), which offer the potential for public–private partnerships (Winrock, 2018; Harvey et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"International development funding has progressed the provision of CS and, together with technological advances and capacity-building initiatives, has increased the reliability of CS across Africa (Vogel et al., 2019). Most CS investments have been towards the agricultural sector, with other focal sectors, including pastoralism, health, water, energy and disaster risk reduction, having only small CS initiatives directed towards them (Nkiaka et al., 2019; Carr et al., 2020). Despite this focus and investment, however, there remains a mismatch between the supply and uptake of CS in Africa as information is often inaccessible, unaffordable, not relevant to context or scale, and is poorly communicated (Singh et al., 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2021) (Table 9.4; Sections 9.4.1.5.1 and 9.13.4.1). Observational data required for effective regional CS, including trend analyses, seasonal climate assessment, modelling and model evaluation, is sparse and often of poor quality (Figure 9.11) and usually requires payment which renders it unaffordable (Winrock, 2018)."

wg2_ch09_9.4.5.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Despite these challenges, the inclusive nature of co-production has  had a positive influence on the uptake of CS into decision making where it has been applied (Table 9.4; Figure 9.12; Vincent et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2019; Carter et al., 2020; Chiputwa et al., 2020) (medium confidence), through sustained inter/transdisciplinary relationships and capacity development (Norström et al., 2020), strategic financial investment, fostering of ownership of resulting products and the combining of scientific and other knowledge systems (Carter et al., 2020; Steynor et al., 2020a). There is high confidence that together with improved institutional capacity building and strategic financial investment, CS can help African stakeholders adapt to projected climate risks (Figure 9.11)."

wg2_ch09_9.4.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"A recent Afrobarometer study covering 34 African countries found 67% of Africans perceive climate conditions for agricultural production to have worsened over time, and report drought as the main extreme weather event to have worsened in the past decade (Selormey et al., 2019). Of these participants, across all socioeconomic strata, 71% of those who were aware of the concept of climate change agreed that it needs to be stopped, but only 51% expressed confidence about their ability to make a difference. East Africans (63%) were almost twice as likely as north Africans (35%) to report that the weather for growing crops had worsened. Additionally, people engaged in occupations related to agriculture (farming, fishing or forestry) were more likely to report negative weather effects (59%) than those with other livelihoods (45%) (Selormey et al., 2019). Similar perceptions have been reported among a diversity of rural communities in many sub-Saharan African countries (Mahl et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2021a)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Rural communities, particularly farmers, are the most studied groups for climate change perception. They perceive the climate to be changing, most often reporting changes in rainfall variability, increased dry spells, decreases in rainfall and increased temperatures or temperature extremes. They perceive these changes to bring a range of negative socioeconomic and environmental effects (Alemayehu and Bewket, 2017; Liverpool-Tasie et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2021a). In some cases, farmers’ perceptions of changes in weather and climate frequently match climate records for decreased precipitation totals, increased drought frequency, shorter rainy season and rainy season delay, and increased temperatures (Figure 9.11; Rurinda et al., 2014; Boansi et al., 2017; Ayanlade et al., 2018), but not in all cases or not for all perceived changes, with common discrepancies in perceived lower rainfall totals (Alemayehu and Bewket, 2017; Ayal and Leal Filho, 2017; Simpson et al., 2021a)."
wg2_ch09_9.4.5.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Farming experience, access to extension services and increasing age are the most frequently cited factors positively influencing the perceptions of climate changes (Alemayehu and Bewket, 2017; Oduniyi and Tekana, 2019). Personal experience of climate-related changes and their impacts appears to be an important factor influencing perceptions through shaping negative associations, for example, experience of flash floods (Elshirbiny and Abrahamse, 2020) or direct effect on economic activity, indicating that perception is not restricted to crop farmers (Liverpool-Tasie et al., 2020). However, perceptions show common misconceptions about the causes of climate change, which has implications for climate action (Elshirbiny and Abrahamse, 2020), highlighting the importance of climate change literacy."
wg2_ch09_9.4.5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Understanding the human cause of climate change is a strong predictor of climate change risk perception (Lee et al., 2015) and a critical knowledge foundation that can affect the difference between coping responses and more informed and transformative adaptation (Figure 9.11; Oladipo, 2015; Mutandwa et al., 2019). At a minimum, climate change literacy includes both having heard of climate change and understanding it is, at least in part, caused by people (Simpson et al., 2021a). However, large inequalities in climate change literacy exist between and within countries and communities across Africa."
wg2_ch09_9.4.5.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"The average national climate change literacy rate in Africa is only 39% (country rates range from 23–66%) (Figure 9.11). Of 394 sub-national regions surveyed by Afrobarometer, 8% (37 regions in 16 countries) have a climate change literacy rate lower than 20%, while only 2% (8 regions) score higher than 80%, which is common across European countries (Simpson et al., 2021a). Striking differences exist when comparing sub-national units within countries. Climate change literacy rates in Nigeria range from 71% in Kwara to 5% in Kano, and within Botswana from 69% in Lobatse to only 6% in Kweneng West (Simpson et al., 2021a). Education is the strongest positive predictor of climate change literacy, particularly tertiary education, but poverty decreases climate change literacy and climate change literacy rates average 12.8% lower for women than men (Simpson et al., 2021a)."

wg2_ch09_box-9.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Vulnerability in Africa is socially, culturally and geographically differentiated among climatic regions, countries and local communities, with climate change impacting the health, livelihoods and food security of different groups to different extents (Gan et al., 2016; Onyango et al., 2016a; Gumucio et al., 2020). This synthesis emphasises intersectionality within vulnerable groups as well as their position within dynamic social and cultural contexts (Wisner, 2016; Kuran et al., 2020), and highlights the differential impacts of climate change and restricted adaptation options available to vulnerable groups across African countries (see also Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18)."
wg2_ch09_box-9.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Vulnerability and exposure to the impacts of climate change are complex and affected by multiple, interacting non-climatic processes, which together influence risk, including socioeconomic processes (Lwasa et al., 2018; UNCTAD, 2020), resource access and livelihood changes (Jayne et al., 2019b) and intersectional vulnerability among social groups (Figure Box 9.1.1; Rao et al., 2020). Socioeconomic processes encompass broader social, economic and governance trends, such as expanded investment in large energy and transportation infrastructure projects (Adeniran and Daniell, 2020), rising external debt (Edo et al., 2020), changing role of the state in social development (Wunsch, 2014), environmental management (Ramutsindela and Büscher, 2019) and conflict, as well as those emanating from climate change mitigation and adaptation projects (Beymer-Farris and Bassett, 2012; van Baalen and Mobjörk, 2018; Simpson et al., 2021b). These macro trends shape both urban and rural livelihoods, including the growing diversification of rural livelihoods through engagement in the informal sector and other non-farm activities, and are mediated by complex and intersecting factors like gender, ethnicity, class, age, disability and other dimensions of social status that influence access to resources (Luo et al., 2019). Research increasingly highlights the intersectionality of multiple dimensions of social identity and status that are associated with greater susceptibility to loss and damage (Caparoci Nogueira et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch09_box-9.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Arid and semi-arid countries in the Sahelian belt and the greater Horn of Africa are often identified as the most vulnerable regions on the continent (Closset et al., 2017; Serdeczny et al., 2017). Particularly vulnerable groups include pastoralists (Wangui, 2018; Ayanlade and Ojebisi, 2019), fishing communities (Belhabib et al., 2016; Muringai et al., 2019a), small-scale farmers (Ayanlade et al., 2017; Mogomotsi et al., 2020; see Section 9.8.1) and residents of formal and informal urban settlements (see Section 9.9). Research has identified key macro drivers, as well as multiple dimensions of social status that mediate differential vulnerability in different African contexts. For example, the contemporary vulnerability of small-scale rural producers in semi-arid northern Ghana has been shaped by colonial economic transformations (Ahmed et al., 2016), more recent neoliberal reforms reducing state support (Fieldman, 2011) and the disruption of local food systems due to increasing grain imports (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015). Age interacts with other dimensions of social status, shaping differential vulnerability in several ways. Projected increases in mean temperatures and longer and more intense heat waves (Figure Box 9.1.1) may increase health risks for children and elderly populations by increasing risks associated with heat stress (Bangira et al., 2015; Cairncross et al., 2018). Temperature extremes are associated with increased risk of mortality in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Kenya and South Africa, with greatest increases among children and the elderly (Bangira et al., 2015; Amegah et al., 2016; Omonijo, 2017; Wiru et al., 2019; see Section 9.10.2.3.1)."
wg2_ch09_box-9.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Rural African women are often disadvantaged by traditional, patriarchal decision-making processes and lack of access to land—issues compounded by kinship systems (that, is matrilineal or patrilineal), migrant status, age, type of household, livelihood orientation and disability in determining their adaptive options (Ahmed et al., 2016; see Section 9.8.1; 9.11.1.2; Box 9.8). Differential agricultural productivity between men and women is about 20–30% or more in dryland regions of Ethiopia and Nigeria (Ghanem, 2011) and challenges women’s ability to adapt to climate change. Limited access to agricultural resources and limited benefits from agricultural policies, compounded by other social and cultural factors, make women more vulnerable to climatic risks (Shukla et al., 2021). Kinship systems can contribute to their vulnerability and capacity to adapt. Women in matrilineal systems have greater bargaining power and have access to more resources than those in patrilineal systems (Chigbu, 2019; Robinson and Gottlieb, 2021; See section 9.8.1; 9.11.1.2)."

More research is needed to examine the intersection of different dimensions of social status on climate change vulnerability in Africa (Thompson-Hall et al., 2016; Oluwatimilehin and Ayanlade, 2021). More analysis of vulnerability based on gender and other social and cultural factors is needed to fully understand the impacts of climate change, the interaction of divergent adaptive strategies, as well as the development of targeted adaptation and mitigation strategies, for example, for women in patrilineal kinship systems, people living with disabilities, youth, girls and the elderly.

Lack of access to assets and social networks, for example, among older populations, are critical limitations to locally driven or autonomous adaptation and limit potential benefits from planned adaptation actions (e.g., adoption of agricultural technologies or effective use of early warning systems)."

A signal of increased annual heatwave frequency has already emerged from the background natural climate variability over the whole continent (Figure 9.14; Engdaw et al., 2021). However, detection of statistically significant rainfall trends is evident in only a few regions (Figure 9.13b), and in some regions different observed precipitation datasets disagree on the direction of rainfall trends (Panitz et al., 2013; Sylla et al., 2013; Contractor et al., 2020). The uncertainty of observed rainfall trends results from a number of sources, including high interannual and decadal rainfall variability, different methodologies used in developing rainfall products, and the lack of and poor quality of rainfall station data (Figure 9.15; Gutiérrez et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.5.1_p5,9.5.1.1 Station Data Limitations ,"With increased GHG emissions, mean temperature is projected to increase over the whole continent, as are temperature extremes over most of the continent (Figure 9.16a, b). Increased mean annual rainfall is projected over the eastern Sahel, eastern east Africa and central Africa (Figures 9.14; 9.16c). In contrast, reduced mean annual rainfall and increased drought (meteorological and agricultural) are projected over southwestern southern Africa and coastal north Africa, with drought in part as a result of increasing atmospheric evaporative demand due to higher temperatures (Figure 9.16e; Ukkola et al., 2020; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation are projected to increase across most of Africa, except northern and southwestern Africa (Figures 9.14; 9.16d)."
wg2_ch09_9.5.1_p7,9.5.1.1 Station Data Limitations ,"Most African countries are expected to experience high temperatures unprecedented in their recent history earlier in this century than generally wealthier, higher latitude countries (high confidence). As low latitudes have lower internal climate variability (e.g. low seasonality), the low-latitude African countries are projected to be exposed to large increases in frequency of daily temperature extremes (hotter than 99.9% of their historical records) earlier in the 21st century compared to generally wealthier nations at higher latitudes (Harrington et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2021; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Although higher warming rates are projected over high latitudes during the first half of this century, societies and environments in low-latitude, low-income countries are projected to become exposed to unprecedented climates before those in high latitude, developed countries (Frame et al., 2017; Harrington et al., 2017; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). For example, beyond 2050, in central Africa and coastal west Africa, 10 months of every year will be hotter than any month in the period 1950–2000 under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) (Harrington et al., 2017; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Ambitious, near-term mitigation will provide the largest reductions in exposure to unprecedented high temperatures for populations in low-latitude regions, such as across tropical Africa (Harrington et al., 2016; Frame et al., 2017)."

Declining rainfall trends ended by 1990 due to the growing influence of GHGs and reduced cooling effect of aerosol emissions, with a trend to wetter conditions emerging in the mid-1990s accompanied by more intense, but fewer precipitation events (Sanogo et al., 2015; Sylla et al., 2016; Kennedy et al., 2017; Barry et al., 2018; Bichet and Diedhiou, 2018a; 2018b; Thomas and Nigam, 2018).

Fulani herders in west Africa believe that when ‘nests hang high on trees, then rains will be heavy; when nests hang low, rains will be scarce’ (Roncoli et al., 2002). In South Africa, LK on weather forecasting is based on the hatching of insects, locust swarm movements and the arrival of migratory birds, which has enabled farmers to make adjustments to cropping practices (Muyambo et al., 2017; Tume et al., 2019). Most of these IK indicators apply to specific communities, and are used for short-term forecasting (e.g., event-specific predictions, such as a violent storm, and onset rain predictions) (Zuma-Netshiukhwi et al., 2013; Mutula et al., 2014). There is evidence of communities that rely heavily on IKLK indicators to forecast seasonal variability across the continent (Kagunyu et al., 2016; Mwaniki and Stevenson, 2017; Tume et al., 2019). However, their accuracy is debatable, due to age-old knowledge losing accuracy because of recent changes in weather conditions (Shaffer, 2014; Adjei and Kyerematen, 2018). There are also some limitations in the transferability of IK across geographical scales, as its understanding is framed by traditional beliefs and cultural practices, and historical and social conditions of each community, which vary significantly across communities. This has direct implications for the adoption of IKLK in national policy and planned adaptation by governments.

Local farmers who depend on this knowledge system for their livelihoods hold the view that African governments do not support and promote it in policy development. Most government agricultural extension workers still consider IK to be unscientific and unreliable (Seaman et al., 2014; Mafongoya et al., 2017). At the national level, there is a lack of recognition and inclusion of IKLK in adaptation planning by African governments, partly because most of the IK and LK in African local communities remains undocumented, but also because IKLK are inadequately captured in the literature (Ford et al., 2016; IPCC, 2019b). This knowledge is predominantly preserved in the memories of the elderly and is handed down orally or by demonstration from generation to generation. It gradually disappears due to memory gaps, and when those holding the knowledge die or refuse to pass it to another generation, the knowledge becomes extinct (Rankoana, 2016a). The way in which IK is transmitted, accessed and shared in most African societies is not smooth (IIED, 2015). IK is also threatened by urbanisation, which attracts rural migrants to urban areas where IKLK use may be more limited (Fernández-Llamazares et al., 2015). Further, most African societies that use IK were once colonised, whereby the African Indigenous ways of knowing were devalued and marginalised (Bolden et al., 2018). There are concerns about the effectiveness of both IK indicators and related adaptation responses by communities in predicting and adapting to weather events under future climate conditions (Speranza et al., 2009; Shaffer, 2014; Hooli, 2016)."
wg2_ch09_9.6.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The overall continental trend is woody plant expansion, particularly in grasslands and savannas, with woody plant cover increasing at a rate of 2.4% per decade (see Figure 9.17; Stevens et al., 2017; Axelsson and Hanan, 2018). There is also increased grass cover in arid regions in southwestern Africa (Masubelele et al., 2014). There is high agreement  that this is attributable to increased CO2, warmer and wetter climates, declines in burned area and release from herbivore browsing pressure, but the relative importance of these interacting drivers remains uncertain (O’Connor et al., 2014; Stevens et al., 2016; García Criado et al., 2020). Woody encroachment is the dominant trend in the western and central Sahel, occurring over 24% of the region, driven primarily by shifts in rainfall timing and recovery from drought (Anchang et al., 2019; Brandt et al., 2019). Remote sensing studies demonstrate greening in southern Africa and forest expansion into water-limited savannas in central and west Africa (Baccini et al., 2017; Aleman et al., 2018; Piao et al., 2020), with increases in precipitation and atmospheric CO2 the probable determinants of change (Venter et al., 2018; Brandt et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). These trends of greening and woody plant expansion stand in contrast to the desertification and contraction of vegetated areas highlighted in AR5 (Niang et al., 2014), but are based on multiple studies and longer time series of observations. Reported cases of desertification and vegetation loss, for example, in the Sahel, appear transitory and localised rather than widespread and permanent (Dardel et al., 2014; Pandit et al., 2018; Sterk and Stoorvogel, 2020)."

An increase in frequency and intensity of hot, dry weather after wildfires has led to a long-term decline in plant biodiversity in Fynbos since the 1960s (Slingsby et al., 2017). Increasing temperatures may have contributed to the declining abundance and range size of South African birds (Milne et al., 2015), including Cape Rockjumper (Chaetops frenatus) and protea canary (Serinus leucopterus), from increased risk of reproductive failure (Lee and Barnard, 2016; Oswald et al., 2020). For hot and dry regions (e.g., Kalahari), there is strong evidence that increased temperatures are having chronic sublethal impacts, including reduced foraging efficiency and loss of body mass (du Plessis et al., 2012; Conradie et al., 2019), and are approaching species physiological limits, with heat extremes driving mass mortality events in birds and bats (McKechnie et al., 2021). Vegetation change linked to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 has had an indirect impact on animals. Increased woody cover has decreased the occurrence of bird, reptile and mammal species that require grassy habitats (Péron and Altwegg, 2015; McCleery et al., 2018). Decreased fruit production linked to rising temperatures has decreased the body condition of fruit-dependent forest elephants by 11% from 2008–2018 (Bush et al., 2020)."

Increased grass cover in arid regions introduced fire into regions where fuel was previously insufficient to allow fire spread, such as the arid Karoo in South Africa (du Toit et al., 2015; Strydom and Savage, 2016). In contrast, shrub encroachment, increased precipitation (Zubkova et al., 2019), vegetation fragmentation and cropland expansion have reduced fire activity in many African grasslands and savannas (Andela and van der Werf, 2014; Probert et al., 2019). These drivers are expected to negate the effect of increasing fire weather and ultimately lead to a reduction in the total burned area under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Knorr et al., 2016; Moncrieff et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016)."

Natural regrowth of savanna plant biomass in southern Africa compensated for biomass removal through human activities (McNicol et al., 2018), and rapid recovery occurred after the 2014–2016 extreme drought (Abbas et al., 2019). During the same drought event, browsing and mixed feeder herbivores were resilient, but grazers declined by approximately 60% and were highly dependent on drought refugia (Abraham et al., 2019). African tropical forests remained a carbon sink through the record drought and temperature experienced in the 2015–2016 El Niño, indicating resilience in the face of extreme environmental conditions (Bennett et al., 2021). This is likely due to the presence of drought-tolerant species and floristic and functional shifts in tree species assemblages (Fauset et al., 2012; Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al., 2019). This resilience indicates that there is the capacity to recover from disturbances and short-term change.

Increased temperature, changes in rainfall and reduced wind speed altered the physical and chemical properties of inland water bodies, affecting water quality and productivity of algae, invertebrates and fish (high confidence). In deeper lakes, warmer surface waters and decreasing wind speeds reduced shallow waters mixing with nutrient-rich deeper waters, reducing biological productivity in the upper sunlit zone (Ndebele-Murisa, 2014; Saulnier-Talbot et al., 2014). In several lakes, climate change was identified as causing changes in insect emergence time (Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2014) and in loss of fish habitats (Natugonza et al., 2015; Gownaris et al., 2016). This set of changes can harm human livelihoods, for example, from reduced fisheries productivity (see Section 9.8.5; Ndebele-Murisa, 2014; Ogutu-Ohwayo et al., 2016) and reduced water supply and quality (Section 9.7.1)."

The northern Mozambique Channel has served as a refuge from climate change and biological reservoir for the entire coastal east African region (McClanahan et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). A southern shift of mangrove species has been observed in south Africa (Peer et al., 2018) with loss in total suitable coastal habitats for mangroves and shifts in the distribution of some species of mangroves and a gain for others (Record et al., 2013). Mangrove cover was reduced 48% in Mozambique in 2000 from Tropical Cyclone Eline, with 100% mortality of seaward mangroves dominated by Rhizophora mucronata (Macamo et al., 2016). Recovery of mangrove species was observed 14 years later in sheltered sites. There is low confidence these cyclone-induced impacts are attributable to climate change owing, in part, to a lack of reliable long-term data sets (Macamo et al., 2016).

This greening trend may slow or reverse with continued temperature increase and/or in areas of increased aridity (Berdugo et al., 2020).

By 2.5°C, suitable habitat of >50% of species are projected to decline for coastal lobster in east and north Africa, with large declines for the commercially important lobster species Jasus lalandii in southern Africa (Boavida-Portugal et al., 2018). More generally, tropical regions, especially exclusive economic zones in west Africa, are projected to lose large numbers of marine species and may experience sudden declines with extratropical regions having potential net increases as species track shifting temperatures poleward (García Molinos et al., 2016; Trisos et al., 2020)."

Global warming reduces available habitat for freshwater species due to reduced precipitation and increased drought leading to increasing water temperatures above optimal physiological limits in floodplains, estuaries, wetlands, ephemeral pools, rivers and lakes (Dalu et al., 2017; Kalacska et al., 2017; Nyboer and Chapman, 2018). Along the Zambezi River, projected flow reductions could cause a 22% reduction in annual spawning habitat and depletion of food resources for fry and juvenile fish that could impede fish migration and reduce stocks (Kangalawe, 2017; Martínez-Capel et al., 2017; Tamatamah and Mwedzi, 2020). More aquatic species will have the capacity to cope with 2°C compared to 4°C global warming, with more negative effects on physiological performance at 4°C (Dallas, 2016; Pinceel et al., 2016; Zougmoré et al., 2016; Nyboer and Chapman, 2017; Ross-Gillespie et al., 2018).

Most of the continent’s water is stored in groundwater (660,000 km 3), which is 20 times more than the water stored in the lakes and 100 times more than the annual renewable water resources (MacDonald et al., 2012). The accessible volume of groundwater via wells and springs is smaller than these estimates (Xu et al., 2019). Africa has 63 transboundary river basins (UNEP, 2010), 72 mapped transboundary aquifers (Nijsten et al., 2018) and 33 transboundary lakes (ILEC and UNEP, 2016), reflecting a highly water-connected and interdependent socio-ecological system across countries, also extending to the coastal areas of the continent (see Chapter 4 Section 4.1)."

In west Africa, declines in river flows have been attributed to declining rainfall and increasing temperature, drought frequency and water demand (Biao, 2017; Thompson et al., 2017; Descroix et al., 2018). In central Africa, the Congo river demonstrates inter-decadal shifts but no long-term trend (Mahe et al., 2013; Alsdorf et al., 2016). However, recently observed falling water levels in its upper and middle reaches are attributed to climate change (von Lossow, 2017)."

However, in southern Africa as a whole, river flows have mostly decreased (high confidence) (Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2014). In east Africa, large rivers such as the Tana show increasing flow (1941–2016) related to increased rainfall in the highlands, with little influence of flow regulation by a series of dams (Langat et al., 2017). The Nile river basin has been experiencing a mainly increasing rainfall trend upstream and decreasing trend downstream (Onyutha et al., 2016). The observed changes are driven by a complex coupling of changes in climate, land use and water demand."
wg2_ch09_9.7.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Observed climate changes in Africa (see Section 9.5) have led to changes in river flow and runoff (Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2014; Wolski et al., 2014) and high fluctuations in lake levels (high confidence) (Natugonza et al., 2016; Ogutu-Ohwayo et al., 2016; Gownaris et al., 2018). Shallow lakes respond dramatically to hydrological changes, for example, Lake Chilwa has dried up completely nine times in the last century (Wilson, 2014), while Lake Chad shrunk by 90% between 1963 and 2000 (Gao et al., 2011). However, recent analyses indicate that Lake Chad’s water levels have been stable since 2000 due to infilling from groundwater resources (Buma et al., 2018; Pham-Duc et al., 2020). Other factors such as deforestation and increased water use in upstream tributaries also contribute to lake shrinking (Mvula et al., 2014). Water levels in Kenya’s mostly shallow rift lakes have been rising since 2010, with some exceeding historical record high levels (Schagerl and Renaut, 2016; Olago et al., 2021). The recent 10-year rising trend is partly attributed to increased rainfall and changing land uses (Onywere et al., 2012; Olago et al., 2021). Changes in water level fluctuations of 13 African lakes have been positively correlated with primary and overall production (Gownaris et al., 2018), and will have important consequences for freshwater ecosystems and related ecosystem goods and services (see Sections 9.6.1.3; 9.8.5). Other effects of observed climate changes in Africa include higher episodic groundwater recharge, particularly in drylands, from heavy rainfall events that are in some cases related to ENSO and the IOD (Taylor et al., 2013; Fischer and Knutti, 2016; Cuthbert et al., 2019; Kotchoni et al., 2019; Myhre et al., 2019), reduced soil moisture, more frequent and intense floods, more persistent and frequent droughts (Douville et al., 2021) and the steady decline and projected disappearance by 2040 of African tropical glaciers (see Section 9.5.9)."

From 1900–2013, Africa suffered the largest number of drought events globally and registered the second largest number of people affected after Asia (Masih et al., 2014). The likelihood of recent severe climate conditions such as the multi-year Cape Town drought has increased due to human-caused climate change (Otto et al., 2018; Pascale et al., 2020; see Box 9.4), and regional and urban floods (Yuan et al., 2018; Tiitmamer, 2020) and droughts (Funk et al., 2018b; Siderius et al., 2018; Uhe et al., 2018) are expected to increase."

Human-caused climate change made the reduced rainfall that caused the drought three times more likely  (95% confidence interval 1.5–6) (Otto et al., 2018; Pascale et al., 2020; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021). After three consecutive years of low precipitation, Cape Town braced for a ‘Day Zero’ where large portions of the city would lose water supply (Cole et al., 2021a). The risk of Day Zero was anticipated to cascade to affect risks to health, economic output and security (Simpson et al., 2021b). The case study highlights the importance of communication, budgetary flexibility, robust financial buffers and insurance mechanisms, disaster planning, intergovernmental cooperation, nature-based solutions, infrastructure transformations and equitable access for climate adaptation in African cities facing water scarcity."
wg2_ch09_box-9.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"A substantial media campaign was launched to inform residents about the severity of the drought and urge water conservation (Booysen et al., 2019; Hellberg, 2019; Ouweneel et al., 2020). Together with stringent demand management through higher water tariffs, this communication campaign played an important role in reducing consumption from 540 to 280 litres per household per day (Booysen et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2019a). Revenue from water sales contributes 14% of Cape Town’s total revenue, making it the third-largest source of ‘own’ revenue for the city (Simpson et al., 2019b). However, with an unprecedented reduction in water use, the municipal budget was undermined (Simpson et al., 2020b). Collecting less revenue created a financial shock as the city struggled to recover operating finance, even while new capital requirements were needed for the development of expensive new water supply projects (Simpson et al., 2019b). This financial shock was compounded by the economic stress of poor agricultural and tourism performance brought about by the drought (Shepherd, 2019; Simpson et al., 2021b). As wealthy residents invested in private, off-grid water supplies, the risk of reduced municipal revenue collections from newly off-grid households aggregated with the risk of reduced tourism, increasing the risk to the reputation of the incumbent administration (Simpson et al., 2021b). This demonstrates how a population cohort with a high response capability to water scarcity can reduce risk while simultaneously increasing risks to the municipality and its capacity to provide water to vulnerable residents (Simpson et al., 2020b). Given that city populations in Africa pay 5–7 times more for water than the average price paid in the USA or Europe (Adamu and Ndi, 2017; Lwasa et al., 2018), municipal finance needs to delink operating revenue from potential climate shocks (see Box 8.6)."
wg2_ch09_box-9.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"The drought led the municipality to consider a broader diversity of water supply options, including groundwater (CoCT, 2019), developing city-scale, slow-onset disaster planning (Cole et al., 2021a) and building an enhanced ‘relationship with water’ (CoCT, 2019; Madonsela et al., 2019). This shift in approach is displayed in the recognition of nature-based solutions as a priority in water resilience-building efforts (Rodina, 2019) and is signalled in Cape Town’s Water Strategy which aims to become a ‘water sensitive city’ that makes ‘optimal use of stormwater and urban waterways for flood control, aquifer recharge, water re-use and recreation’ (CoCT, 2019)."

Despite significant investments in water security by public and private entities, one-quarter of Cape Town’s population remains in persistent conditions of water stress, emphasising the challenge and importance of inclusive solutions that address the persistent social and economic stressors which affect vulnerability to water scarcity (Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019)."

wg2_ch09_box-9.4_p8,NO_TITLE,"Since 1954, the Makutapora wellfield in semi-arid, central Tanzania has supplied safe water to the city of Dodoma. Substantial rises in wellfield pumping and population growth have increased freshwater demand in Dodoma and dependence upon the Makutapora wellfield, currently the sole perennial source of piped water to the city. Yet, there is high uncertainty of groundwater recharge rates (Nkotagu, 1996; Taylor et al., 2013) which rely on intense seasonal rainfall associated with the ENSO and the IOD modes of climate variability (e.g., 2 to 7 years) to contribute disproportionately to recharge (Taylor et al., 2013; Kolusu et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch09_box-9.4_p9,NO_TITLE,"Defining a sustainable pumping rate for the Makutapora wellfield is complicated by the variable and episodic nature of groundwater replenishment in this dryland environment.

The disproportionate contribution of intense seasonal rainfalls to the replenishment of the Makutapora wellfield, consistent with observations from across sub-Saharan Africa (Cuthbert et al., 2019), suggests that groundwater in drylands are currently naturally resilient to climate change. However, it remains unclear whether climate change will strengthen or weaken the influence of ENSO and IOD on rainfall (Brown et al., 2020) and thereby affect the predictability of groundwater recharge."

Nature-based solutions to improve the resilience of wellfield abstraction to increased pumpage and climate change include managed aquifer recharge (MAR). The sharing of general lessons learned from other cities in dryland Africa employing MAR, such as Windhoek in Namibia (Murray et al., 2018), could prove invaluable."

In some higher altitude regions, like the Niger Inland Delta in west Africa, river flows and water levels are expected to increase (medium confidence) (Aich et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2017). In the Lower Niger Basin, combined average annual rainfall and erosivity for all the climatic models in all scenarios shows increasing rainfall amounts are projected to result in an increasing average change in rainfall-runoff erosivity of about 14%, 19% and 24% for the 2030s, 2050s and 2070s, with concomitant increase in soil loss of 12%, 19% and 21% (Amanambu et al., 2019).

The increase of precipitation in the wet season indicates a higher possibility of flash floods, while decreased runoffs in dry season further intensify existing shortage of irrigation water demand (Ayele et al., 2016; Siam and Eltahir, 2017; Meresa and Gatachew, 2018). The annual flow and revenues from hydropower production and irrigated agriculture of the Blue Nile River at Khartoum are projected to increase under maximum but are expected to decrease under minimum and median projected changes in streamflow for 2041–2070 and 2071–2100, respectively (Tariku et al., 2021).

However, at more local scales, the projections cover a range of slight declines to significant increases in mean annual rainfall amounts (Gulacha and Mulungu, 2017).

Such approaches confer multiple benefits to nature and society at scale and enhance efficiency gains through technology and management improvements, but their full implementation has not yet been realised (Weinzierl and Schilling, 2013; McDonald et al., 2014; UN Environment, 2019). Drylands are particularly singled out as ignored areas that require integrated water resource management approaches (Section 9.3.1; Stringer et al., 2021). Appropriate ecosystem-based adaptations that are applicable at scale should be identified and strongly embedded in these approaches to deliver multiple benefits while maintaining the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity (UN Environment, 2019; see Sections 9.6.4; 9.8.5; Box 4.6). Furthermore, adaptation options are often influenced or constrained by institutions, regulation, availability, distribution, price and technologies (McCarl et al., 2016).

With increasing societal demands on more variable water resources under climate change, an intensification of WEF competition and trade-offs are projected (D’Odorico et al., 2018; Dottori et al., 2018). Other interacting factors, for example, the increasing number of transnational investments in land resources can lead to localised increased competition for water resources (Messerli et al., 2014; Breu et al., 2016; Chiarelli et al., 2016). Understanding such nexus interlinkages can help characterise risks to water resource security, identify co-benefits and clarify the range of multi-sectoral actors involved in and affected by development decisions (Kyriakarakos et al., 2020). Major barriers and entry points for greater integration include coordination of horizontal policy and integration of climate change adaptation actions (England et al., 2018), capturing the scarcity values of water and energy embedded in food/energy products (Allan et al., 2015), and inclusion of community-based organisations such as water resource user associations (Villamayor-Tomas et al., 2015) and agricultural cooperatives (Kyriakarakos et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch09_9.7.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"While natural variability in the hydrological cycle has always been considered by water resources planners and engineers (Müller Schmied et al., 2016; Muller, 2018), many countries will have to take into consideration the range of historically unprecedented extremes expected in the future. Increasingly, the provision of urban water security is dependent on the functioning of complex bulk water infrastructure systems consisting of dams, inter-basin transfers, pipelines, pump stations, water treatment plants and distribution networks (McDonald et al., 2014). Risk-based studies on the potential climate change risks for water security show that there are benefits when risks are reduced at the tails of the distribution—floods and droughts—even if there is little benefit in terms of changes in the mean (Arndt et al., 2019). When risk is taken into account in an integrated (national) bulk water infrastructure supply system, the overall impact of climate change on the average availability of water to meet current and future demands is significantly reduced (Cullis et al., 2015). Further, stemming leakages and enhancing efficiency through technology and management improvements is important in building climate-resilient water conveyance systems (UN Environment, 2019). African cities could leap-frog through the development phases to achieve a water sensitive city ideal, reaping benefits such as improved liveability, reduced flooding impacts, safe water and overall lower net energy requirements and avoid making the mistakes developed countries’ cities have made (Fisher-Jeffes et al., 2017) (Brodnik et al., 2018). However, the challenge of large proportions of the population lacking access to even basic water supply and sanitation infrastructure (Armitage et al., 2014) must be simultaneously and effectively addressed, particularly in light of other major exacerbating factors, like the COVID-19 pandemic (Section 9.11.5)."

However, longer (multi-decadal) hydrological datasets and model improvements are required (Taye et al., 2015), and models should incorporate the quantification of the wider benefits, risks and political opportunities arising from reservoir development to better inform decision makers to achieve a higher level of (transboundary) cooperation (Digna et al., 2016; Nijsten et al., 2018). Collaboration between scientists and policymakers to address the complexity of decision making under uncertainty (Steynor et al., 2016) (Pienaar and Hughes, 2017), coupled with community involvement in participatory scenario development and participatory GIS to aid in collaborative planning that is context specific (Muhati et al., 2018; Álvarez Larrain and McCall, 2019) are powerful tools for more beneficial adaptive and resilience-building actions."

Alternative water supply options such as desalination, managed aquifer recharge, stormwater harvesting and re-use (direct and indirect, potable and non-potable), all require significant amounts of energy and are complex to operate and maintain. A failure to provide a source of reliable energy and the capacity to implement, maintain and operate these systems is a significant contributor to water scarcity risks in Africa (Muller and Wright, 2016). Soft adaptation options include increasing water use efficiency, changing agricultural practices, more appropriate water pricing (Olmstead, 2014) and enhancing capacity to tackle groundwater overexploitation (Kuper et al., 2016), among others (see Section 9.10.2.4 and Chapter 4 Sections 4.6 and 4.7)."

As gender-differentiated relationships are complex, adaptation should take into account intersectional differences such as homeownership, employment and age (Harris et al., 2016), educational, infrastructural and programmatic interventions (Pouramin et al., 2020), aspects of protection and safety (Mackinnon et al., 2019), barriers to adaptation and gendered differences in the choice of adaptation measures (Mersha and Van Laerhoven, 2016), the complex power dynamics of existing social and political relations (Djoudi et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2017), and inclusion and empowerment of women in the management of environmental resources (Makina and Moyo, 2016). Incorporation of gender and water inequities into climate change adaptation would have a significant impact on achieving the SDGs (particularly 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6), while failure to incorporate gender will undermine adaptation efforts (Bunce and Ford, 2015; Fleifel et al., 2019; Pouramin et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch09_box-9.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"The interdependencies in the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, coupled with its high exposure to climate change, amplify WEF risks.

For example, increasing demand for water for agricultural and energy production is driving an increasing competition over water resources between food and energy industries which, among other effects, compromises the nutritional needs of local populations (Zografos et al., 2014; Dottori et al., 2018). Drought events, such as in southern Africa during the 2015/16 El Niño, have been associated with major multi-sector impacts on food security (over 40 million food-insecure people and extensive livestock deaths) and reduced energy security through disruption to hydropower generation (associated in Zambia with the lowest rate of real economic growth in over 15 years) (Nhamo et al., 2018). The WEF nexus of the Nile and Zambezi river basins, which include many of Africa’s largest existing hydropower dams, have received the most attention. In these two regions, where socioeconomic development is already driving up demand, projections indicate that water scarcity may be exacerbated by drying (Munday and Washington, 2019) and increased flow variability (Siam and Eltahir, 2017). However, for Africa more widely, very few studies fully integrate all three WEF nexus sectors and rarely include an explicit focus on climate change."

The vast majority of hydropower additions would occur in the Congo, Niger, Nile and Zambezi river basins, and the majority of the irrigation capacity additions would occur in the Niger, Nile and Zambezi River basins (Figure Box 9.5.1; Huber-Lee et al., 2015 )."

Future levels of rainfall, evaporation and runoff will have a substantial impact on hydropower and irrigation production. Climate models disagree on whether climates will become wetter or dryer in each river basin. Cervigni et al. (2015) modelled revenues from the sale of hydroelectricity and irrigated crops in major African river basins under different climate scenarios between 2015 and 2050 (Figure Box 9.5.1). The study found that hydropower revenues in the driest climate scenarios could be 58% lower in the Zambezi River basin, 30% lower in the Orange basin and 7% lower in the Congo basin relative to a scenario with current climate conditions. Hydropower revenues in the wettest climate scenario could be more than 20% higher in the Zambezi river basin and 50% higher in the Orange basin. The biggest risk to the production of irrigated crops is in the eastern Nile where irrigation revenue could be 34% lower in the driest scenario and 11% higher in the wettest than in a scenario without climate change (Cervigni et al., 2015)."

For example, Yang and Wi (2018) consider the WEF nexus in the Great Ruaha tributary of the Rufiji River in Tanzania motivated by an observed decrease in streamflow during the dry season in the 1990s, but without an explicit focus on climate. Yang and Wi (2018) show sensitivity of water availability for irrigated crop production to warming, and sensitivity of hydropower generation and ecosystem health to changes in precipitation and dam development. Understanding of WEF nexus interlinkages can help characterise risks and identify entry points and the relevant institutional levels for cross-sectoral climate change adaptation actions (England et al., 2018). An integrated response can be enhanced through the inclusion of community-based organisations, such as water resource user associations and the wide range of other multi-sectoral actors involved in and affected by development decisions. Capturing the scarcity values of water and energy embedded in food and other products can help identify the co-benefits and costs of integrated adaptation (Allan et al., 2015)."

Production will not be the only aspect of food security that is impacted by climate change. Processing, storage, distribution and consumption will also be affected. Access to healthy and adequate food in the face of climate change requires resilience across these components of the food system (Adenle et al., 2017). However, most studies on climate change impacts on food in Africa are heavily focused on production only. A significant knowledge gap, therefore, exists around the complex ways in which climate change will interact with broader components of African food systems, and strategies for making these systems more resilient, particularly in a context of rapid population growth and urbanisation across the continent (Adenle et al., 2017; Schmitt Olabisi et al., 2018)."

Adoption, however, is hindered by lack of information and training, availability or affordability of seed, inadequate labelling and packaging size for seed supplies and financial constraints (Fisher et al., 2015). Moreover, drought-tolerant varieties do not address changing temperature regimes (Guan et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Crop diversification enhances crop productivity and resilience and reduces vulnerability in smallholder farming systems (McCord et al., 2015; Mulwa and Visser, 2020). In Tanzania, diversified crop portfolios are associated with greater food security and dietary quality (Brüssow et al., 2017). In Kenya, levels of crop diversity are higher in villages affected by frequent droughts, which are the main cause of crop failure (Bozzola and Smale, 2020). Crop diversification also helps control pest outbreaks, which may become more frequent and severe under increased climate variability and extreme events (Schroth and Ruf, 2014). High farming diversity enables households to better meet food needs, but only up to a certain level of diversity (Waha et al., 2018), and the viability of and benefits from mixed farming are highly context dependent (Thornton and Herrero, 2015; Weindl et al., 2015)."

These practices can enhance the benefits of other adaptations, such as planting drought- and heat-tolerant or improved varieties, although effects vary across soil types, geographical zones and social groups (Makate et al., 2019; Mutenje et al., 2019). Non-climatic variables, such as financial resources, access to information and technology, level of education, land security and gender dynamics affect feasibility and adoption (Makate et al., 2019; Mutenje et al., 2019)."

The feasibility and effectiveness of this adaptation depend on biophysical and socioeconomic conditions (Amamou et al., 2018; Harmanny and Malek, 2019; Schilling et al., 2020). Irrigation is unaffordable for many smallholder farmers and only covers a negligible proportion of the total cultivated area. Nonetheless, in some regions of west Africa, small-scale irrigation, including the digging of ditches, holes and depressions to collect rainwater (Makondo and Thomas, 2018), is widely adopted and promoted to support national food security (Dowd-Uribe et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"African farmers are also diversifying their income sources to offset reduced yields or crop losses by shifting labour resources to off-farm work, or by migrating seasonally or longer term (Kangalawe et al., 2017; Hove and Gweme, 2018). Off-farm activities provide financial resources that rural households need to cope with extreme climate variability (Hamed et al., 2018; Rouabhi et al., 2019). However, in some cases, these off-farm activities can be maladaptive at larger scales, such as when households turn to charcoal production, which contributes to deforestation (Egeru, 2016). Whether off-farm activities constitute maladaptation depends on whether resources are available to upgrade skills or support investments that make a new business more lucrative. Without such resources, this option may lead to impoverishment (see Box 5.8)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Smallholder farmers’ responses tend to address short-term shocks or stresses by deploying coping responses (e.g., selling labour, reducing consumption and temporary migration), rather than longer-term sustainable adaptations (Ziervogel and Parnell, 2014; Jiri et al., 2017). This is partly due to institutional barriers (e.g., markets, credit, infrastructure and information) and resource requirements that are unaffordable to smallholder farmers (Pauline et al., 2017). There is a need for policies that strengthen natural, financial, human and social capitals, the latter being key to household and community resilience, especially where government services may be limited (Mutabazi et al., 2015; Alemayehu and Bewket, 2017). There is evidence that collective action, local organisations and climate information are associated with higher food security, and that institutional interventions are needed to ensure scaling up of adaptations (Thornton et al., 2018)."

wg2_ch09_9.8.3_p9,NO_TITLE,"Global warming beyond 2°C will place nearly all of sub-Saharan Africa cropland substantially outside of its historical safe climate zone (Kummu et al., 2021) and may exponentially increase the cost of adaptation and residual damage for major crops (Iizumi et al., 2020). Without accounting for CO2 increases, global-scale studies employing ensembles of gridded crop models for 2°C of global warming find that for adaptation using genetic cultivar change in most of Africa net losses are projected, even with adaptation up to 2°C of global warming for rice, maize, soybean and wheat (Minoli et al., 2019; Zabel et al., 2021), although model uncertainty is still high (Müller et al., 2021). In contrast, when accounting for CO2 increases, applying new genetics for rice under warming is projected to fully counteract all climate change-induced losses in Africa up to 3.5°C of global warming, except in west Africa (van Oort and Zwart, 2018)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.3_p10,NO_TITLE,"However, compared to temperate regions, risks of adaptation shortfalls—that is climate change impacts even after adaptation—are generally greater for current agricultural conditions across much of Africa (tropical, arid and semi-arid) (Sun et al., 2019). The overall adaptation potential to offset yield losses across Africa for rice, maize and wheat reduces with increasing global warming. On average, in projections including adaptation options, yield losses, in the median case, are reduced from −33% to −10% of 2005 levels at 2°C of global warming and from −46% to −23% at 4°C, but estimates vary widely (Figure 9.22; Hasegawa et al., 2021). Across Africa, the risks of no available genetic varieties of maize for growing season adaptation are higher for east Africa and southern Africa than for central or west Africa (Zabel et al., 2021). To keep pace with expected rates of climate change, crop breeding, development and adoption must accelerate to meet the challenge (Challinor et al., 2016). Regional modelling has shown very little efficacy for late sowing, intensification of seeding density and fertilizers, water harvesting and other measures for cereals in west Africa at 2°C of global warming (Sultan and Gaetani, 2016; Guan et al., 2017). Historical climate change adaptation by crop migration has been shown in some cases (Sloat et al., 2020) but poses risks to biodiversity and water resources, and this option may be limited for maize in Africa by suitable climate shifting completely across national borders and available land at the edges of the continent (Franke et al., 2021). More research is required to evaluate the potential effectiveness and limits of adaptation options in African agriculture under future climate change (see Chapter 5 Section 5.4.4 for more details)."

There is growing evidence of farmers’ use of weather and climate information, especially at the short- and medium-time horizon (Carr et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2018). Digital services can contribute to the sustainable intensification of food production globally (Duncombe, 2018; Klerkx et al., 2019). This points to the need for the scientific and development communities to better understand the conditions that enable widespread adoption in Africa."
wg2_ch09_9.8.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Although climate information services have the potential to strengthen farmers’ resilience, barriers to accessibility, affordability and utilisation remain (Krell et al., 2021). Often the information offered is not consistent with what farmers need to know and how they access and process information (Meadow et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018). Production of salient and credible climate information is hindered by the limited availability of and access to weather and climate data (Coulibaly et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2019a). The existing weather infrastructure remains suboptimal to enable the development of reliable early warning systems (Africa Adaptation Initiative, 2018; Krell et al., 2021). Of the 1017 land-based observational networks in the world, only 10% are in Africa, and 54% of Africa’s surface weather stations cannot capture data accurately (Africa Adaptation Initiative, 2018; World Bank, 2020d)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Advances in remote sensing and climate analysis tools have allowed the development of weather index insurance products as a potential adaptation option, with Malawi and Ethiopia being early testbeds (Tadesse et al., 2015, Section 9.11.4). These pilot projects were initially sponsored by NGOs, but in the last decade, the private sector has become more active in this sector. The Ghana Agricultural Insurance Pool and Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda are examples. Despite the potential for weather index insurance, uptake by smallholder farmers in Africa remains constrained by several factors. These include the failure to capture actual crop loss as in traditional crop insurance products, as well as the inability of poor farmers to pay premiums (Elum et al., 2017; Weber, 2019). Weather index insurance could be part of a wider portfolio of risk mitigation services offered to farmers (Tadesse et al., 2015; Weber, 2019). Strategic partnerships between key players (e.g., credit institutions, policymakers, meteorologists, farmer associations, extension services, NGOs) are needed to develop better products and build capacity among smallholder farmers to engage more beneficially with weather index insurance (Singh et al., 2018; Tesfaye et al., 2019)."

Estimates suggest that fish provides approximately 200 million people in Africa with their main source of animal protein and key micronutrients (Obiero et al., 2019). Although marine fisheries account for >50% of total capture fishery production (Obiero et al., 2019), 2.9 million tonnes of fish are harvested annually from inland water bodies constituting the highest per capita inland fishery production of any continent (2.56 kg per person per year) (Harrod et al., 2018a; Funge-Smith and Bennett, 2019)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.5.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change already poses a significant threat to marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture in Africa (Blasiak et al., 2017; Harrod et al., 2018a). Severe (>30%) coral bleaching has impacted ~80% of major reef areas in the western Indian Ocean and Red Sea along Africa’s eastern coast (Hughes et al., 2018). Biological effects (e.g., changes in primary production, fish distribution) have also occurred (Hidalgo et al., 2018). Range shifts in marine fish species can exacerbate boundary conflicts among fisher communities (Penney et al., 2017; Belhabib et al., 2019). Changes in fish distribution and reductions in catch across inland fisheries are associated with climatic variability by fishing communities (Okpara et al., 2017b; Lowe et al., 2019; Muringai et al., 2019b). Floods and reduced river flow reduces fish catches (Kolding et al., 2019), which scale positively with discharge rates in rivers across Africa (McIntyre et al., 2016). Warming air and water temperatures have altered water stratification patterns in African lakes causing reductions in or redistributions of primary productivity and leading to reduced fish biomass (Section 9.6.1.3). Such changes, partially explain reduced fish catches in Lake Tanganyika (Cohen et al., 2016). In some regions, water scarcity has resulted in conflict within and among food production sectors (pastoralists, fishers and farmers) in this region (Okpara et al., 2017b). Small-scale and artisanal fisher communities are ill-equipped to adapt to climate impacts because there are few financially accessible alternative livelihoods (Belhabib et al., 2016; Ndhlovu and Saito, 2017)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"At 4.3°C global warming, maximum catch potential (MCP) from marine fisheries in African Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) would decrease by 12–69% by the end of the 21st century relative to recent decades (1986–2005), whereas global warming of 1.6°C would limit the MCP decrease to 3–41% (Cheung William et al., 2016; IPCC, 2019c). By mid-century under 2°C global warming, MCP would decrease by 10 to >30% on the western coast of South Africa, the Horn of Africa and west Africa, indicating these regions could be at risk to declines in MCP earlier in the century than other parts of Africa (Cheung et al., 2016). Declining fish harvests due to sea temperature rise could leave 1.2–70 (median 11.1) million people in Africa vulnerable to deficiencies in iron, and up to 188 million to vitamin A and 285 million to vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids by mid-century under 1.7°C global warming (Golden et al., 2016). Maire et al. (2021) assessed the nutritional vulnerabilities of African countries to climate change and overfishing, and found that the four most vulnerable countries ranked on a scale from 0 (low vulnerability) to 100 (high vulnerability) were Mozambique (87), Madagascar (76), Tanzania (61) and Sierra Leone (58). Coral reef habitat in east Africa is projected to decrease, resulting in negative impacts on demersal fish stocks and invertebrates (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Central, west and east Africa are projected to be at the greatest nutritional risk from sea temperature rise, leading to reduced catch in coastal waters (Figure 9.25; Golden et al., 2016). In north Africa, a rise in water temperatures is expected to impact the phenology and migratory patterns of large pelagic species (e.g., bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus) (Hidalgo et al., 2018). Increased sea surface temperatures have been associated with increases in spring and summer upwelling intensity reducing the abundance and larval survival of small pelagic fishes and shellfish in west Africa (Bakun et al., 2015; Tiedemann et al., 2017; Atindana et al., 2020). Ocean warming, acidification and hypoxia are predicted to affect the early life history stages of several marine food species, including fish and crustaceans (Kifani et al., 2018). Climate warming is projected to impact water temperature and horizontal and vertical mixing on the southern Benguela ecosystem, with marked negative effects on the biomass of several important fishery resources by 2050 amplified under 2.5°C compared to 1.7°C global warming (Ortega-Cisneros et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.5.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"For inland fisheries, 55–68% of commercially harvested fish species will be vulnerable to extinction under 2.5°C global warming by the end of the 21st century (2071–2100) compared to 77–97% under 4.4°C global warming (Figure 9.26). This will increase the number of countries that are at food security risk due to fishery species declines from 10 to 13 (Figure 9.26). Other recent analyses suggest that African countries with the highest inland fisheries production have low- to mid-range projected climate risk (2.4°C–2.6°C local temperature increase compared to other regions with 2.7°C–3.3°C increase by end of century) based on a 3.9°C global warming scenario (Harrod et al., 2018b). In regions where inland fishery production is derived primarily from lakes, there is a lower likelihood of reduced catch, especially where precipitation is projected to increase (e.g., African Great Lakes region) (Harrod et al., 2018b). Regions reliant on rivers and floodplains (e.g., Zambezi and Niger basins) are more likely  to experience downturns in catch, as hydrological dynamics may be altered (Harrod et al., 2018b). Projections suggest that opportunistic species that do well in modified systems (Escalera-vázquez et al., 2017) and small pelagic fishes will remain important components of inland fishery food systems (Kolding et al., 2016; Gownaris et al., 2018; 2019). Climate adaptation responses that rely on freshwater resources (e.g., hydroelectric power generation, agricultural irrigation) represent threats to inland fisheries (Cowx et al., 2018; Harrod et al., 2018c), by changing flow regimes, reducing water levels, and increasing runoff of pesticides and nutrients (Harrod et al., 2018c)."
wg2_ch09_9.8.5.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"For both marine and freshwater fisheries, climate-related extreme weather events and flooding may drive the loss of fishing days, cause damage and loss to fishing gear, endanger the lives of fishers and block transportation from damaged roads (Muringai et al., 2021).

wg2_ch09_9.8.5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Patterns of vulnerability and adaptive capacity are highly context dependent and vary within and among fishing communities in coastal and riparian areas (Ndhlovu and Saito, 2017; Lowe et al., 2019; D’agata et al., 2020). Interventions that integrate scientific knowledge and fishers’ local knowledge while focusing on vulnerable groups are expected to be more successful (Musinguzi et al., 2018; Muringai et al., 2019b). Infrastructure improvements (e.g., storage facilities, processing technologies, transport systems) could reduce post-harvest losses and improve food safety (Chan et al., 2019). Fisher safety can be aided by early warning of severe weather conditions (Thiery et al., 2017), enhanced through communication via mass media and mobile phones (Thiery et al., 2017; Kiwanuka-Tondo et al., 2019). Although changing fishing gears and shifting target species are important adaptation options for artisanal fishers, many have instead expanded their fishing range or increased effort (Musinguzi et al., 2015; Belhabib et al., 2016). Adapting to the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries productivity requires management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and species distributions, such as increasing marine protected areas, strengthening regional trade networks, and increasing the investment and innovation in climate-resilient aquaculture production (Golden et al., 2021). This could yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today in 50% of African countries with marine territories under 2°C global warming and in 35% under 4.3°C global warming (Free et al., 2020). For inland fisheries, opportunities for adaptation include better integration of inland fisheries into management plans from other sectors (e.g., hydropower and irrigation) (Harrod et al., 2018c; Cowx and Ogutu-Ohwayo, 2019; McCartney et al., 2019).

Flooding is a major hazard across Africa (Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Douglas, 2017) and is increasing (Zevenbergen et al., 2016; Elboshy et al., 2019). An increase in extreme poverty and up to a 35% decrease in consumption has been associated with exposure to flood shocks (Azzarri and Signorelli, 2020). Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region globally that did not show decreasing rates of flood mortality since the 1990s (Tanoue et al., 2016). Economic opportunities, transportation of goods and services, and mobility and access to essential services, including health and education, are greatly hindered by flooding (Gannon et al., 2018). Severe impacts from tropical cyclone landfalls have been recorded in east and southeastern Africa (Rapolaki and Reason, 2018; Cambaza et al., 2019; Chatiza, 2019; Hope, 2019). Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in early 2019 caused flooding of districts in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, with substantial loss and damage to infrastructure in the energy, transport, water supply, communication services, housing, health and education sectors, particularly in Mozambique (Figure 9.27; see also Cross-Chapter Box DISASTER in Chapter 4; Warren, 2019; Dube et al., 2021; Phiri et al., 2021)."

Total damages in four west African countries (Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal and Togo) in 2017 were estimated at USD 850 million for pluvial floods and USD 555 million for fluvial floods (Croitoru et al., 2019). Unprecedented economic loss, in terms of goods and properties, estimated by the Nigerian insurance industry at USD 200 million resulted from floods in Lagos in 2011 (Adelekan, 2016). In southern Africa, the highest costs were incurred from flood losses during the period 2000–2015 (UNEP-FI, 2019b; Simpson, 2020)."

The viability of businesses and economic well-being of large populations employed in SMEs is severely affected by climate hazards as reported for local wind storms in Ibadan (Adelekan, 2012), El Niño-related flooding (Nairobi), drought-induced water supply disruption (Gaborone) and power outages (Lusaka) (Gannon et al., 2018). High water demand due to high rates of urbanisation and population growth, coupled with drought, reduce groundwater levels in cities (e.g., Bouake, Harare, Tripoli, Niamey) and increase saltwater intrusion into groundwater in coastal areas, reducing water availability and water security, particularly for poorer populations not connected to municipal water networks (Aswad et al., 2019; Claon et al., 2020)."

About 70% of African cities are highly vulnerable to climate shocks of which small- and medium-sized towns and cities are more at risk (Verisk Maplecroft, 2018). Flooding was perceived as the most prominent water risk in 75% of 36 sampled cities across African sub-regions, while drought-related water scarcity was indicated as very important/important in 66.7% of cities (OECD, 2021). Almost one-third of African cities with populations of 300,000 or more are located in areas of high exposure to at least one natural hazard, including floods (11%) and droughts (20–25%) using natural hazard data for the period 1970s to early 2000s (Gu et al., 2015). The coastal cities of east, west and north Africa are particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels (Abutaleb et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019a). From 2000–2015, the proportion of people exposed to floods increased for most African countries, with Mozambique and multiple countries in West Africa estimated to have had the proportion of their populations exposed to flooding increase more than 50% (Tellman et al., 2021)."

Additionally, reduced lung function in people with HIV from previous tuberculosis infection may put them at high risk for morbidity and death during extreme heat (Abayomi and Cowan, 2014).

wg2_ch09_9.11.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Several studies indicate that experiencing low rainfall, warming temperatures or extreme weather events reduce education attainment and that future climate change may reduce children’s school participation, particularly for agriculturally dependent and poor urban households. In west and central Africa, experiencing lower-than-average rainfall during early life is associated with up to 1.8 fewer years of completed schooling in adolescence, while more rainfall and milder temperatures during the main agricultural season are positively associated with educational attainment for boys and girls in rural Ethiopia (Randell and Gray, 2016; Randell and Gray, 2019). In Uganda, low rainfall reduced primary school enrolment by 5% for girls (Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013), and in Malawi, in utero drought exposure was associated with delayed school entry among boys (Abiona, 2017). In rural Zimbabwe, experiencing drought conditions during the first few years of life was associated with fewer grades of completed schooling in adolescence, which translates into a 14% reduction in lifetime earnings (Alderman et al., 2006). In Cameroon, warming temperatures have negatively affected plantain yields, which in turn is linked to lower educational attainment (Fuller et al., 2018). One suggested mechanism underlying the relationship between climate and schooling is that adverse climatic conditions can reduce income among farming households, leading them to pull children out of school (Randell and Gray, 2016; Marchetta et al., 2019). Other potential mechanisms are poor harvests from droughts or supply interruptions from extreme weather events leading to undernutrition among young children, negatively affecting cognitive development and schooling potential (Alderman et al., 2006; Bartlett, 2008)."

Statistically based empirical analyses project that global warming of 2.3°C by 2050 could lower GDP per capita across sub-Saharan Africa by 12% (SSP2) (Baarsch et al., 2020) and 80% for warming >4°C by 2100 (SSP5, 75% for MENA) (Burke et al., 2015b). Depending on the future socioeconomic scenario, this could increase global inequality and leave some African countries poorer than at present (Burke et al., 2015b). Inequalities between African countries are projected to widen under climate change, with negative impacts estimated to be largest in west and east Africa (Baarsch et al., 2020). While negative impacts across African economies are highly likely  under climate change, precise magnitudes are debated in the literature. Alternative statistical analyses suggest a 12% reduction of GDP per capita by 2100 under RCP8.5 across African countries relative to a future without climate change (Kahn et al., 2021), while computable general equilibrium models generate smaller damages as well, ranging from 3.8% reduction across sub-Saharan Africa in 2060 under warming of 2.5°C (Dellink et al., 2019) to 12% across all of Africa in 2100 under warming of 5°C (SSP4) (Takakura et al., 2019)."

The probability of this positive gain to GDP per capita from achieving 1.5°C versus 2°C is reported as close to 100% (Burke et al., 2018a). While these estimates rely on temperature and rainfall-driven damages, SLR also poses a risk for Africa.

Yet, informal sector activity and small to medium-sized enterprises can be highly exposed to climate extremes, as they are often located in low-lying areas, coastal areas, sloped or other hazardous zones (Thorn et al., 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Businesses and individuals in the informal sector, including construction workers, domestic workers, street vendors and transport workers, often cannot operate during climate shocks due to interruptions in transportation and commodity flows and, without the ability to insure against risk, struggle to recover assets from extreme events such as flooding, landslides and waterlogging (Chen, 2014; Thorn et al., 2015; Roy et al., 2018a). Women are overrepresented in the more poorly remunerated sections of the informal economy (Satterthwaite et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is scope for governments to better harness the role of the informal sector in mitigation and adaptation (Douxchamps et al., 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Multi-level governance that includes informal service providers, such as informal water and sanitation networks, into planned adaptation programmes can increase climate resilience, in part because these networks can respond with more flexibility than hard infrastructure projects (Satterthwaite et al., 2020; Peirson and Ziervogel, 2021). Climate risk is often concentrated in urban informal settlements (Section 9.9.4). Here, informal land markets influence development patterns and can help ensure adherence to building codes to ensure safety of informally built structures at high risks of landslides and floods and enforce compliance with regulations relating to planning and land use (Thorn et al., 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Improving land management practices of charcoal producers and artisanal gold miners, combined with appropriate alternative livelihood and energy sources, can reduce emissions and increase resilience (e.g., reduce erosion and sedimentation, increase water infiltration) and benefit health (Atteridge, 2013; Paz et al., 2015; Macháček, 2019; Barenblitt et al., 2021; Eniola, 2021). Providing concessional loans, commercial financing or equity investment to informal brick makers can boost delivery of low emission social housing while the use of crop residues or renewable energy for brick making can replace wood biomass and reduce pressure on forests (Alam, 2006; Paz et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p1,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"High temperature-related income losses have been observed in both low- and high-income countries, suggesting optimistic economic development trajectories may not substantially reduce climate change impacts on aggregate economic performance in Africa (low confidence) (Burke et al., 2015b; Deryugina and Hsiang, 2017; Henseler and Schumacher, 2019). Nevertheless, climate change impacts on poverty in Africa will depend on how socioeconomic development unfolds over the coming decades (medium confidence) (Rozenberg and Hallegatte, 2015; Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017; Henseler and Schumacher, 2019). Climate change by 2030 is projected to push 39.7 million Africans into extreme poverty 3  under a baseline scenario of delayed and non-inclusive growth, with food prices acting as the dominant channel of impact, but this number is cut roughly in half under an inclusive economic growth scenario (Rozenberg and Hallegatte, 2015; Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017; Jafino et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p2,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"People in Africa are disproportionately employed in highly climate-sensitive sectors: 55–62% of the sub-Saharan African workforce is employed in agriculture and, although between 90–95% of cropland is rainfed (Woodhouse et al., 2017; ILO, 2018a; International Institute of Water Management, 2019; World Bank, 2020c), there has been an expansion of small-scale ‘farmer-led irrigation’ (Woodhouse et al., 2017). Agricultural GDP also appears more strongly affected by increasing temperatures than non-agricultural GDP, implying livelihood diversification out of agriculture may help minimise future economic damage (Bezabih et al., 2011; Burke et al., 2015b; Acevedo et al., 2017; Deryugina and Hsiang, 2017), although such workforce reallocation requires careful management and planning depending on the overall livelihood portfolios, type of farmer and profitability (Stringer et al., 2020). De-agrarianisation can feed urbanisation, which may exacerbate inequality within and between countries (Stringer et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p3,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"Changes in trade patterns may help mitigate projected aggregate economic losses by reallocating agricultural production abroad and encouraging economic diversification toward less affected sectors. Temperature increases have been shown to lower agriculture and manufacturing exports with especially large declines in poor countries (Jones and Olken, 2010; Roberts and Schlenker, 2013). Further, imports of agricultural products are projected to rise across most of Africa by 2080–2099 under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), with increases ranging from ~30% of GDP in the Central African Republic to ~5% of GDP in South Africa and Nigeria, although some countries will experience increases in net agricultural exports (Nath, 2020). While these reallocation effects may be large, current evidence is mixed regarding whether such adjustment of production will dampen or amplify overall social costs of climate change in Africa (Costinot et al., 2012; Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; Wenz and Levermann, 2016; Nath, 2020), as food prices are projected to rise by 2080–2099 across all African countries under a scenario with high challenges to mitigation and adaptation (SSP3 and RCP8.5), with the largest price effects (up to 120%) experienced in Chad, Niger and Sudan (Nath, 2020). Moreover, reallocating production of agriculture abroad could be maladaptive if it leads to decline or replacement of traditional sectors by industrial and service sectors, which could lead to land abandonment, food insecurity and loss of traditional practices and cultural heritage (Thorn et al., 2020; Gebre and Rahut, 2021; Nyiwul, 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p4,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"African countries have high inequality: the average within-country share of income accruing to the top 10% of households was estimated at 50% for 2019 (Robilliard, 2020). However, analysis of INDCs across 54 African countries suggests current climate policies do not, on average, target social inequality in energy, water and food security; proposed mitigation and adaptation actions fell about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality across these sectors (Nyiwul, 2021). In contrast, adaptation actions can be designed in ways that actively work towards reducing inequality, whether gender, income, employment, education or otherwise (Andrijevic et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p5,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"In rural Africa, poor and female-headed households face greater livelihood risks from climate hazards (high confidence). Women often constitute a high proportion of the informal workforce and are also more likely  to be unemployed than men (ILO, 2018a). These factors leave women, and particularly female-headed households, at greater risk of poverty and food insecurity from climate hazards. Controlling for multiple factors, income of female-headed households in agricultural districts in South Africa is more vulnerable to precipitation variability than those headed by men (Davidson, 2016; Flatø et al., 2017). Across nine countries in east and west Africa women tend to control smaller plots of land that is often of poorer quality, have less access to inputs such as fertilizer, tools and improved seeds, have lower educational attainment and benefit less from extension services, government agencies and non-governmental organisations (Perez et al., 2015). Gender assessments prior to adaptation programmes can identify disparities in division of labour and income and socio-cultural norms, hindering women from holding leadership positions or determining livelihood and resource-use activities, thereby helping ensure equitable benefits from livelihood diversification and improving women’s working conditions (ILO, 2018a). Gender-responsive policy instruments can measure success using sex-disaggregated data to monitor impact and meaningful participation in decision making (GCF, 2018b)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p6,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"Exposure to climate hazards can trap poorer households in a cycle of poverty (Dercon and Christiaensen, 2011; Sesmero et al., 2018) and poor people in Africa are often more exposed to climate hazards than non-poor people. For example, poor people live in hotter areas in Nigeria and in multiple African countries, poor households are more exposed to flooding (Section 9.9.2; Hallegatte et al., 2016). Daily wage labourers and residents of urban informal settlements are vulnerable to heat stress because of the urban heat island effect combined with congestion, little shade and ventilation (Bartlett, 2008). Climate change can negatively affect household poverty through price spikes, destroying assets or ability to invest in new assets and reducing productivity (Hallegatte et al., 2016) with important impact pathways operating through agriculture, ecosystem functioning and health (Sections 9.6; 9.8; 9.10; Chapters 5; 7; 8). Non-poor people can lose more in absolute terms from climate shocks because of having more assets and higher incomes, but in relative terms, poor people often lose more than the non-poor. These relative losses matter most for livelihoods and welfare (Hallegatte et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p7,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"In Malawi, wealthier households were able to maintain more diversified livelihoods, buffering them from extreme weather-related income losses (Sesmero et al., 2018). Poorer households have limited access to resources such as savings, credit, irrigation technologies and insurance, which can lead to larger crop and other income losses from climate hazards, preventing investments to improve resilience to future climate shocks (Castells-Quintana et al., 2018). Poor households may reduce risk or aid recovery by cooperating with other households in their community to adapt collectively to climate change, for example, through informal insurance networks (Paul et al., 2016; Wuepper et al., 2018). Prioritising poor households for interventions including social protection, EbA, universal healthcare, climate-smart buildings and agriculture, flexible work hours under extreme heat and early warning systems will increase adaptation to climate shocks (Section 9.6.4; Chapter 6; Angula and Menjono, 2014; Moosa and Tuana, 2014; Hallegatte et al., 2016; Day et al., 2019). Pro-poor policies that link mitigation and adaptation, such as using renewable energy to increase rural electrification or using revenues from a carbon tax, combined with international financial support to increase social assistance, could support sustainable eradication of poverty under near-term climate change (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Aklin et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2021c). Integrating urban green infrastructure into adaptation planning in informal settlements can simultaneously unlock pathways for inclusivity and social justice (Section 9.9.5; Tozer et al., 2020; Wijesinghe and Thorn, 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.4_p8,9.11.4.1 Climate Insurance ,"Social protection has been used for decades, particularly in eastern and southern Africa, to safeguard poor and vulnerable populations from poverty and food insecurity (Niño-Zarazúa et al., 2012). Instruments of social protection include public works programmes, cash transfers, in-kind transfers, social insurance and microinsurance schemes that assist individuals and households to cope during times of crisis and minimise social inequality. Evidence from Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda indicates national social protection programmes are effective in improving individual and household resilience to climate-related shocks, regardless of whether they aim specifically to address climate risks (Ulrichs et al., 2019). Strengthening social protection and better integrating climate risk management into design of social protection programmes can help build long-term resilience to climate change (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Agrawal et al., 2019). For example, public works programmes can build climate resilience by targeting soil, water and ecosystem conservation and carbon sequestration, such as South Africa’s Working for Water Programme that restores river catchments to reduce fire risk and increase water supplies (Turpie et al., 2008; Norton et al., 2020)."

Investments in renewable energy, building efficiency retrofits, education and training, natural capital (i.e., ecosystem restoration and EbA), R&D, connectivity infrastructure and sustainable agriculture can help meet both economic recovery and climate goals (Hepburn et al., 2020; Dibley et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch09_9.11.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been substantially worsened by climate hazards in many places. In others, outbreak response has been disrupted (Phillips et al., 2020; Kruczkiewicz et al., 2021). These vulnerabilities are rooted in insufficient disaster preparedness infrastructure but are almost always worsened by social and economic inequality. Ensuring the most vulnerable populations are properly protected from climate change has co-benefits for recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic (Manzanedo and Manning, 2020). In particular, efforts to reduce syndemic vulnerabilities across key sectors (especially health, livelihoods and food security) will lessen climate change impacts and will also reduce the risk and impacts of future epidemics and pandemics, for example, during the pandemic, water scarcity has been a barrier to a key risk mitigation behaviour (hand washing). In the long-term, development efforts focused on WASH will reduce this vulnerability and also reduce the health toll of diarrheal disease linked to climate change (Anim and Ofori-Asenso, 2020; Zvobgo and Do, 2020). Spending recovery funds on social safety nets will reduce inequality and protect the most vulnerable communities (especially women and low-income and marginalised communities) from the social and economic impacts of disasters. Key among these safety nets is universal health coverage, including low- or no-cost access to essential medicine, high-quality preventative care, financial protections against medical debt and increased geographic and population coverage for all services (Hallegatte et al., 2016). All of these are key components of climate change adaptation for health and will reduce both the rate at which future outbreaks start and their total scope and impact (Carlson et al., 2021). The co-benefits of multilateral cooperation on the attainment of universal health coverage will be a key determinant of success or failure in both climate change adaptation and pandemic preparedness."

Urbanisation can increase when reduced moisture availability depresses farm incomes or pastoral livelihoods become unviable (Marchiori et al., 2012; Henderson et al., 2014; Mastrorillo et al., 2016). The influence of rainfall on rural–urban migration increased since decolonisation, possibly due to more lenient legislation on internal mobility, with each 1% reduction in precipitation below a long-term average associated with a 0.45% increase in urbanisation (Barrios et al., 2006). The rate of rural–urban migration is anticipated to increase (Neumann et al., 2015) as a result of increasing vulnerability of agricultural livelihoods to climate change (Serdeczny et al., 2017). Nevertheless, rural–urban migration is not a simple one-way process. Peri-urban and rural areas provide developmental feedback loops, helping create a ‘regional agglomeration’ effect, for instance, through growing food demand, family and social connections, and flows back to rural areas of goods and services and financial investments (UN-Habitat, 2016; Dodman et al., 2017)."

Some evidence indicates people who leave tend to be more educated, possibly leading to ‘brain drain’ (Mbaye, 2017). Recent evidence suggests hotter-than-normal temperatures across 103 countries, including many in Africa, increased asylum applications to the European Union (Missirian and Schlenker, 2017). Assuming no change in present-day vulnerability, asylum applications are projected to increase 34% across Africa (relative to 2000–2014) at 2.2°C global warming (Missirian and Schlenker, 2017), although this finding has been challenged in the literature (Abel et al., 2019; Boas et al., 2019)."

As such, they present a lower-bound estimate of potential climate change impacts on internal migration. Projections are for two warming scenarios: low emissions (RCP2.6) and high emissions (RCP8.5), both coupled with a socioeconomic pathway (SSP4) in which low-income countries have high population growth, high rates of urbanisation, and increasing inequality within and among countries. By 2050, between 17.4 million (RCP2.6) and 85 million (RCP8.5) people (up to 4% of the region’s total population) could be moving as a consequence of climate impacts on water stress, crop productivity and SLR.

Loss of heritage assets may be a direct consequence of climate change/variability (Markham et al., 2016), or a consequence of indirect factors resulting from climate change, for example, economic instability and poor decision making in areas of governance. In northern Nigeria, climate change exacerbates the impact of poor land use decisions, reducing the flow of the Yobe River and negatively impacting the Bade fishing festival because the available fish species continue to decline (Oruonye, 2010). Similarly, Lake Sanké in Mali has been degraded by a combination of urban development and poor rainfall, threatening the Sanké mon collective fishing rite (UNESCO, 2018b)."

The link between rainfall and conflict appears likely  due to crop losses and declines in economic opportunity. One study found that dry growing seasons increase conflict incidence across 36 African nations, with spillover effects from the location of climate shock to neighbouring communities (Harari and Ferrara, 2018). Conflict-inducing impacts of drought have also been uncovered in Somalia (Maystadt and Ecker, 2014), Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya (Fjelde and von Uexkull, 2012; Hendrix and Salehyan, 2012; Couttenier and Soubeyran, 2014; Ralston, 2015; Linke et al., 2018; van Weezel, 2019), the DRC (von Uexkull et al., 2020) and in a pooled sample of African and Asian countries (von Uexkull et al., 2016). Extremely high rainfall may also incite conflict risk, although results are mixed (Hendrix and Salehyan, 2012; Raleigh and Kniveton, 2012).

For example, one study found that, relative to each country’s optimal annual temperature, realised temperatures across sub-Saharan Africa increase the annual incidence of war by 29.3% on average (Carleton et al., 2016). Another finds that rising temperatures due to climate change may lead to higher levels of violence in sub-Saharan Africa if political rights do not improve from current conditions (Witmer et al., 2017). Available studies on adaptation in conflict-affected areas tend to have a narrow focus, particularly on agriculture-related adaptation in rural contexts and adaptation by low-income actors, with little known beyond these contexts (Sitati et al., 2021).

Rising incomes may mitigate conflict–climate relationships (Carleton et al., 2016), while weak institutions, lack of political freedom, agricultural dependence and exclusion of ethnic groups increase their strength (Schleussner et al., 2016a; von Uexkull et al., 2016; Witmer et al., 2017; Ide et al., 2020). In particular, agriculturally dependent and politically excluded groups in Africa are especially vulnerable to the impact of drought on conflict (von Uexkull et al., 2016; Koubi, 2019). Household-level resilience to economic shocks has been shown to lower support for violence after drought (von Uexkull et al., 2020).

Although no continental assessment has quantified climate risk to African heritage and little is known of near-term exposure to hazards such as SLR and erosion, for a handful of coastal heritage sites included in global or Mediterranean studies, 10 cultural sites are identified to be physically exposed to SLR by 2100 at high emissions scenarios (RCP8.5) (Marzeion and Levermann, 2014; Reimann et al., 2018), of which, seven World Heritage Sites in the Mediterranean are also projected to face medium or high risk of erosion (Figure 9.38; Reimann et al., 2018). Further, Brito and Naia (2020) identify natural heritage sites across 27 African countries that will be affected by SLR by 2100 (RCP8.5), of which 15 sites covering eight countries demonstrated a high need for proactive management actions because of high levels of biodiversity, international conservation relevance and exposure to SLR (Figure 9.38).

wg2_ch09_FAQ 9.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"With increasing warming, there is a lower likelihood species can migrate rapidly enough to track shifting climates, increasing extinction risk across more of Africa. At 2°C global warming more than 10% of African species are at risk of extinction. Species ability to disperse between areas to track shifting climates is limited by fencing, transport infrastructure, and the transformation of landscapes to agriculture and urban areas. Many species will lose large portions of their suitable habitats due to increases in temperature by 2100. Coupled with projected losses of Africa’s protected areas, higher temperatures will also reduce carbon sinks and other ecosystem services. Many nature-based adaptation measures (e.g., for coral reefs, mangroves, marshes) are less effective or no longer effective above 1.5°C of global warming. Human-based adaptation strategies for ecosystems reach their limits as availability and affordability of land decreases, resulting in migration, displacement and relocation."

Further limits arise from insufficient consideration of climate change in adaptation planning and infrastructure investment and insufficient financial resources. There are also limits to adaptation for food production strategies. Increasing climate extreme events—droughts and floods—impose specific adaptation responses which poorer households cannot afford. For instance, the use of early maturing or drought-tolerant crop varieties may increase resilience, but adoption by smallholder farmers is hindered by the unavailability or unaffordability of seed."
