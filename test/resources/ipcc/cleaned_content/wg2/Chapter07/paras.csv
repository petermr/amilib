wg2_ch07_7.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter assesses peer-reviewed and selected grey literature published since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on the impacts and projected future risks of climate change for health, well-being, migration and conflict, taking into consideration determinants of vulnerability and the dynamic structure of human populations and communities. Particular attention is given to potential adaptation challenges and actions as well as potential co-benefits for health associated with mitigation actions. AR5 presented strong evidence-based statements regarding the likely 2  impacts of climate change on health, migration and conflict in two separate chapters on Human Health (Chapter 11) and Human Security (Chapter 12). The present chapter covers all topics found in AR5 Chapter 11 and Sections 12.4 (Migration and Mobility Dimensions of Human Security), 12.5 (Climate Change and Armed Conflict) and 12.6 (State Integrity and Geopolitical Rivalry) and provides an additional, expanded assessment of mental health impacts, gender dimensions of climate risks and solution pathways."
wg2_ch07_7.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"AR5 stated with very high confidence that the health of human populations is sensitive to climate change (Smith et al., 2014). Specific observations of current impacts included the expansion of the geographical ranges of some diseases into previously unaffected areas and changes in the distributions of some food-, water- and vector-borne diseases  (high confidence). Increasing future health risks were projected from injury, disease and death due to more intense heatwaves and fires  (very high confidence)  , undernutrition in poor regions  (high confidence)  , food- and waterborne diseases  (very high confidence)  and VBDs  (medium confidence). AR5 found that climate change is a multiplier of existing health vulnerabilities, including food insecurity and limited access to safe water, improved sanitation, healthcare and education, and that the most effective measures to reduce vulnerability in the near term are programmes that implement and improve basic public health  (very high confidence). Opportunities for co-benefits from mitigation actions were identified through such actions as reducing local emissions of short-lived climate pollutants from energy systems  (very high confidence)  and expanding transport systems that promote active travel  (high confidence). The significant growth in peer-reviewed publications on links between climate change and human health and well-being since AR5 allowed for a more detailed and wider reaching assessment in the present chapter and stronger confidence statements for many climate-sensitive health outcomes."
wg2_ch07_7.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Key statements made in AR5 Chapter 12 (Human Security) about the impacts of climate change on migration were that climate change will have significant impacts on forms of migration that compromise human security and that mobility is a widely used strategy to maintain livelihoods in response to social and environmental changes (high agreement, medium evidence). Research on the influence of climate change and climate extremes on multiple forms of migration (including voluntary migration, involuntary displacement and immobility) has expanded significantly since AR5, which has allowed for a more robust assessment in this chapter, with migration also featuring in most other sectoral and regional chapters of this report. With respect to violent conflict, AR5 Chapter 12 found that people living in places affected by violent conflict are particularly vulnerable to climate change (medium evidence, high agreement ), that some of the factors increasing the risk of violent conflict within states are sensitive to climate change (medium evidence, medium agreement ) and that climate change will lead to new challenges to states and will increasingly shape both conditions of security and national security policies (medium evidence, medium agreement ). As with other subjects assessed in this chapter, there has been significant growth in the number of assessable studies, but there remain shortcomings with respect to the availability of evidence regarding the specific nature of causal linkages and the attributability of particular outcomes to climate events or conditions."
wg2_ch07_7.1.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, several new international agreements have come into effect that have implications for international responses to the climate risks assessed in this chapter. The 2015 Paris Agreement, which explicitly mentions health in three separate sections, set new goals for adaptation and established a working group to study the effects of climate change on population displacement. The 17 United Nations (UN) SDGs for 2030, adopted in 2015, are all important for building adaptive capacity in general, with goals 13 (‘Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts’) and 3 (‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’) being directly relevant to this chapter. Other SDGs contain specific targets that are also relevant for this chapter, including Target 10.7 (‘Well-managed migration policies’), Target 8.3 (‘Decent work for all’) and Target 5.4 (‘Promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies’) (Piper, 2017). The 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction puts an emphasis on health and well-being (Aitsi-Selmi and Murray, 2016) In 2018, UN member states negotiated Global Compacts for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and on Refugees that, taken together with the Paris Agreement, provide pathways for coordinated international responses to climate-related migration and displacement (Warner, 2018)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"All three post-AR5 IPCC Special Reports considered some of the research that is assessed here in greater detail. The 2018 report on 1.5°C (SR1.5) included a review of climate change and health literature published since AR5 and called for further efforts for protecting health and well-being of vulnerable people and regions (Ebi et al., 2018b) and highlighted links between climate change hazards, poverty, food security, migration and conflict. The 2019 Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (IPCC, 2019b) emphasised the impacts of climate change on food security; highlighted links between reduced resilience of dryland populations, land degradation, migration and conflict; and raised concerns about the impacts of climate extremes. The 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC, 2019a) detailed how changes in the cryosphere and ocean systems have impacted people and ecosystem services, particularly food security, water resources, water quality, livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation as well as the culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous Peoples. It also noted the risks of future displacements due to rising sea levels and associated coastal hazards."
wg2_ch07_7.1.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Assessing the links between human health, well-being and climate change is a new task for AR6, reflecting a broad perspective on health that increasingly acknowledges the importance of well-being and its interactions with individual and population health. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’ (WHO, 1946). Although this chapter assesses physical health, mental health and general well-being separately, they are inter-connected; any type of health problem can reduce overall well-being and vice versa. For example, a child receiving inadequate nutrition may not be sick but is experiencing a clear threat to well-being that has implications for future physical and mental health."
wg2_ch07_7.1.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is no consensus definition of well-being, but it is generally agreed that it includes a predominance of positive emotions and moods (e.g., happiness) compared with extreme negative emotions (e.g., anxiety), satisfaction with life, a sense of meaning and positive functioning, including the capacity for unimpaired cognitive functioning and economic productivity (Diener and Tay, 2015; Piekałkiewicz, 2017). A capabilities approach (Sen, 2001) focuses on the opportunity for people to achieve their goals in life (Vik and Carlquist, 2018) or the ability to take part in society in a meaningful way, and is reflected in personal freedoms, human agency, self-efficacy, ability to self-actualise, dignity and relatedness to others (Markussen et al., 2018). An indigenous perspective on well-being is broad and typically incorporates a healthy relationship with the natural world (Sangha et al., 2018); emotional and mental health have also been linked to a strong cultural identity (Butler et al., 2019; Dockery, 2020). ‘Health’ itself is sometimes described as including relationships between humans and nature as well as links to community and culture (Donatuto et al., 2020; Dudgeon et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Subjective well-being is consistently associated with personal indicators such as higher income, greater economic productivity, better physical health (Diener and Tay, 2015; Delhey and Dragolov, 2016; De Neve et al., 2013) and environmental health, and it is reflected in societal indicators such as social cohesion and equality (Delhey and Dragolov, 2016). In a global survey of over 1 million people taken between 2004 and 2008 via the Gallup World Poll, annual income and access to food were strong predictors of subjective well-being and a healthy environment. In particular, access to clean water was important even when household income was controlled (Diener and Tay, 2015). Access to green spaces was also closely associated with well-being (high confidence) (Lovell et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, more comprehensive frameworks for framing and studying global health issues, including planetary health, ‘One Health’ and eco-health, have gained traction. These frameworks share an ecological perspective, emphasise the role of complex systems and highlight the need for inter-disciplinary approaches related to human health research and practice (Lerner and Berg, 2015; Zinsstag et al., 2018; Whitmee et al., 2015; Steffen et al., 2015). These frameworks increasingly shape the evidence related to climate change health impacts and response options, highlight the dynamics of complex systems in risk management and direct risk management efforts in new directions."
wg2_ch07_7.1.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"Building on these frameworks and perspectives, there is increasing overlap in the literature on global health, climate change impacts and estimates of loss and damage. The Global Burden of Disease study for 2019 for the first time included non-optimal temperature as a risk factor (Murray et al., 2020). Work by social scientists continues to explore how climate change indirectly affects resource availability, productivity, migration and conflict (Burke et al., 2015a; Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Hsiang et al., 2017), bringing multiple lines of inquiry together to study the associations between global environmental changes, socioeconomic dynamics and impacts on health and well-being. Morbidity associated with migration and displacement, especially in the context of small island states, has been identified as a non-material form of loss and damage (Thomas and Benjamin, 2020; McNamara et al., 2021). Social costs of carbon estimates have been updated to include excess mortality associated with climate change, increasing estimates substantially (Dressler, 2021)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there has been a steady increase in standardised, globally scoped, data-driven health impact assessments, such as the ongoing Global Burden of Disease study (James et al., 2018) that now includes scenario-based projections (Foreman et al., 2018), that make linkages with other global priorities, including the SDGs (Fullman et al., 2017). Attention has turned from prioritising specific diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, to strengthening health systems and providing universal health coverage (Chang et al., 2019), with an ongoing emphasis on the social determinants of health. Several climate-sensitive health outcomes are now tracked in the annual Lancet Countdown reports (Watts et al., 2015; Watts et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2019; Watts et al., 2021). The Global Burden of Disease study is beginning to examine climate-sensitive disease burdens, incorporate temperature as a risk factor (Murray et al., 2020) and project future cause-specific disease burdens in a warming world (Burkart et al., 2021). Although not assessed in this chapter, there are numerous ongoing assessments of climate change impacts on health and well-being being undertaken by national and local health authorities that continue to generate insights into climate-related health impacts and suggest response options relevant for decision makers."
wg2_ch07_7.1.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"While the knowledge base regarding global health has increased, a comprehensive framework is not in place that fully integrates health, well-being and environmental impacts from climate change allowing for the cumulative assessment of their impact. Moreover, significant cracks in the foundation of global health governance that affect preparedness and adaptive capacity for climate change, among other threats, have been identified (Phelan et al., 2020; Defor and Oheneba-Dornyo, 2020; Ostergard et al., 2020; Shaffie, 2021). While attention to climate change and health has increased and there is evidence of increasing adaptation activity in the health sector (Watts et al., 2019), there is also continued evidence of substantial adaptation gaps (UNEP, 2018; UNEP, 2021) including gaps in humanitarian response capacity for climate-related disasters (Watts et al., 2021) that appear to be widening as adverse climate change impacts on health and well-being accrue."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter uses the conceptual framing described in Chapter 1, in which risks emerging from climate change are described in terms of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, with adaptation and climate resilient development being responses that have the potential to reduce or modify risk. The observed and projected future risks to health well-being, involuntary population displacements and conflict identified in this chapter are associated with a range of hazards that are manifested at a variety of geographical and temporal scales. These include observed and projected changes in climate normals; changes in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of extreme events; and hazards such as rising sea levels and extreme temperatures where the impacts have only begun to be widely experienced. The 2021 report of IPCC WGI (IPCC, 2021) provides an assessment of observed and projected changes in these hazards and is the backdrop against which assessments of future risks and adaptation options identified in the present chapter should be considered."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The exposure to hazards of populations, infrastructure, ecosystem capital, socioeconomic systems and cultural assets critical to health and well-being varies considerably across and within regions  (high confidence). Exposure is also projected to vary across and within regions over time, depending on future GHG emissions pathways, development trajectories and differential vulnerability, particularly for exposure to extreme events and conditions, such as floods and droughts (Figures 7.1a, 7.1b) (Winsemius et al. 2018). For this reason, region-specific assessments of climate-related risks for health, displacement and conflict are found in each of the regional chapters of this report in addition to the general assessment that appears in this chapter."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Vulnerability to climate change varies across time and location, across communities, and among individuals within communities; it reflects variations and changes in macro-scale non-climatic factors (such as changes in population, economic development, education, infrastructure, behaviour, technology and ecosystems) and individual- or household-specific characteristics, such as age, socioeconomic status, access to livelihood assets, pre-existing health conditions and ability (US Global Change Research Program, 2016; Chapter 1)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Many direct and indirect effects of climate change pose multiple threats to human health and well-being and can occur simultaneously, resulting in compounding or cascading impacts for vulnerable populations. For example, many of the long-term impacts of climate change on NCDs and injury described in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 are associated with future increases in air temperature and levels of air pollution; in many regions, and especially in large urban centres in Asia and Africa, these particular hazards are already causing substantial increases in morbidity and mortality due to respiratory illnesses (Tong et al., 2016). Climate change can therefore be expected to magnify such health risks over the long term."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"At the same time, urban populations will also be experiencing indirect risks through climate change impacts on food and potable water systems, variations in the distribution and seasonality of infectious diseases and growing demand for shelter due to increased in-migration. The accumulation of these risks over time can be expected to generate accelerating declines in community resilience and health, with future vulnerability potentially expanding in a nonlinear fashion (Dilling et al., 2017; Liang and Gong, 2017; El-Zein and Tonmoy, 2017; see also Chapter 6). Further, although each individual risk in isolation may be transitory or temporary for the individuals or groups exposed, taken cumulatively, the impacts could create conditions of chronic lack of well-being, and early life experiences with specific illnesses and conditions could have lifelong consequences (Watts et al., 2015; Otto et al., 2017; WHO, 2018a). In this context, there is a distinct need for greater longitudinal research on vulnerability to multiple climatic and non-climatic health and well-being hazards over time (Fawcett et al., 2017). There is also need for more research to identify critical thresholds in social vulnerability to climate change (Otto et al., 2017); these include rapid, stepwise changes in vulnerability that emerge from changes in exposure (for example, air temperatures above which mortality rates or impacts on pre-natal health accelerate (Arroyo et al., 2016; Ngo and Horton, 2016; Abiona, 2017; Auger et al., 2017; Molina and Saldarriaga, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b)) and thresholds in adaptation processes (such as when rural out-migration rates grow due to climate-related crop failures (McLeman, 2017))."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"In virtually all of the research identifying particular climate-related risks to health, well-being, migration and conflict, specific types of individuals are identified as having higher levels of vulnerability and exposure to climate-related health hazards: people who are impoverished, undernourished, struggle with chronic or repeated illnesses, live in insecure housing in polluted or heavily degraded environments, work in unsafe conditions, are disabled, have limited education and/or have poor access to health and social infrastructure (WHO, 2018a). Their disproportionate exposure to ongoing climate hazards and their inability to recover from extreme events increase not only their own vulnerability but also that of the wider communities in which they live (US Global Change Research Program, 2016). Highly vulnerable populations are not evenly distributed across regions (Figure 7.2) nor within countries. Yet, even those fortunate enough to live in better neighbourhoods with greater financial means, higher-paying jobs and good access to resources and services, may experience adverse climate-related outcomes through community-level interactions and linkages (Haines and Ebi, 2019). Increased inequity itself threatens well-being and an effective response to climate change should not only avoid increased inequity but identify ways in which to reduce existing inequity."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate change poses distinct risks to women’s health. Vulnerability to climate-related impacts on health and well-being shows notable differentiations according to gender, beyond implications for pregnant women. In many societies, differential exposure to such risks relate to gendered livelihood practices and mobility options. Pregnancy and maternal status heighten vulnerability to heat, infectious diseases, food-borne infections and air pollution (Arroyo et al., 2016; Ngo and Horton, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017b). Extreme heat events, high ambient temperatures, high concentrations of airborne particulates, water-related illnesses and natural hazards are associated with higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight and pre-term birth (Arroyo et al., 2016; Ngo and Horton, 2016; Abiona, 2017; Auger et al., 2017; Molina and Saldarriaga, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b). Women and girls are at greater risk of food insecurity (FAO, 2018; Alston and Akhter, 2016), which is particularly problematic in combination with the nutritional needs associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding. Women and girls are more likely to die in extreme weather events (Garcia and Sheehan, 2016; Yang et al., 2019). Women are also expected to face a greater mental health burden in a changing climate (Manning and Clayton, 2018). Further, climatic extremes and water scarcity are associated with increases in violence against girls and women (Anwar et al., 2019; Opondo et al., 2016; Le Masson et al., 2016; Udas et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Children are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Children often have unique pathways of exposure and sensitivity to climate hazards, given their immature physiology and metabolism and high intake of air, food and water relative to their body weight as compared with adults (US Global Change Research Group, 2016). Climate change is expected to increase childhood risks of malnutrition and infectious disease for children in low-income countries through its impacts on household food access, dietary diversity, nutrient quality, water and changes in maternal and childcare access and breastfeeding (Tirado, 2017; FAO et al., 2018; Perera, 2017). Children living in locations with poor sanitation are especially vulnerable to GI illnesses, with future rates of diarrhoeal diseases among children expected to rise under many climate change scenarios (Cissé et al., 2018; WHO, 2014). Outdoor recreational opportunities for children may be reduced by extreme weather events, heat and poor air quality (Evans, 2019). Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to post-traumatic stress after extreme weather events; the effects may even be long-lasting, with impacts on their adult functioning (Brown et al., 2017; UNICEF, 2021; Thiery et al., 2021)"
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Population age structures and changes over time have a significant influence on vulnerability to the impacts of weather and climate. Older adults (generally defined as persons aged 65 and older) are disproportionately vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change and weather extremes, including a greater risk of succumbing to waterborne pathogens due to poorer functioning thermoregulatory mechanisms, greater sensitivity to dehydration, changes in their immune systems and greater likelihood of having pre-existing chronic illnesses such as diabetes or respiratory, cardiovascular and pulmonary illnesses (Benmarhnia et al., 2016; Diaz et al., 2015; Mayrhuber et al., 2018; Paavola, 2017). Older adults may be less prompt in seeking medical attention when suffering from GI illnesses, which can lead to dehydration (Haq and Gutman, 2014). Åström et al. (2017) anticipate heat-related mortality among the elderly in Europe to rise in the 2050s under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in the absence of significant preventative measures. In a study of the combined effects of warming temperatures and an aging population in Korea, Lee and Kim (2016) projected a four- to six-fold increase in heat-related mortality by the 2090s when accounting for temperature and age structure."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"People living in poverty are more likely to be exposed to extreme heat and air pollution and have poorer access to clean water and sanitation, accentuating their exposure to climate change-associated health risks (UNEP, 2021; FAO et al., 2018). Poverty influences how people perceive the risks to which they are exposed, how they respond to evacuation orders and other emergency warnings and their ability to evacuate or relocate to a less risk-prone location (US Global Change Research Program, 2016). Poorer households, who often live in highly exposed locations, are more likely to be forced into low-agency migration as a means of adapting to climate risks and at the same time are the most likely to be immobile or trapped in deteriorating circumstances where migration would be a preferred response (Leichenko and Silva, 2014; Fazey et al., 2016; Sheller, 2018). Climate emergencies disproportionally affect people with disabilities because of their inherent vulnerabilities, which may impair their ability to take protective action; they are also frequently excluded from adaptation planning (Gaskin et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Rural and urban populations are often exposed to different types of climate-related health risks. For example, because of the UHI effect and high concentrations of air pollution from motor vehicles and industrial activity, people who live in urban areas may have higher rates of extreme heat stress and respiratory illnesses than their rural counterparts (Hondula et al., 2014; Heaviside et al., 2016; Macintyre et al., 2018; Schinasi et al., 2018). Conversely, rural populations, especially those dependent on resource-based livelihoods, may have a greater exposure to climate impacts on food production or natural hazard events, which have subsequent effects on household nutrition and food security (Springmann et al., 2016a; see also Chapters 5 and 6 of this report)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Indigenous Peoples, especially those who live in geographically isolated, resource-dependent and/or impoverished communities, are often at greater risk of health impacts of climate change (Ford et al., 2020) (US Global Change Research Program, 2016). The close inter-connection of land-based livelihoods and cultural identity of many indigenous groups exposes them to multiple health- and nutrition-related hazards (Durkalec et al., 2015; Sioui, 2019) with potential implications for community social relations and individual mental health (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2015). Climate change risk exposures may be complicated by changes in lifestyle, diet and morbidity driven by socioeconomic processes, further increasing health risks for Indigenous Peoples (Jaakkola et al., 2018). Environmental consequences of climate change can also affect social ties and spiritual well-being, in part because land is often an integral part of their culture and spiritual identity."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Stresses and shocks associated with climate change are drivers of food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America (Betts et al., 2018). The most vulnerable groups include smallholder farmers, pastoralists, agricultural laborers, poorer households, refugees, indigenous groups, women, children, the elderly and those who are socioeconomically marginalised (FAO et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b) (high confidence). Men, women, children, the elderly and the chronically ill have different nutritional needs and these vulnerabilities may be amplified by gendered norms and differential access to resources, information and power (IPCC, 2019b). Extreme climate events have immediate and long-term impacts on food insecurity and malnutrition in poor and vulnerable communities, including when women and girls need to undertake additional duties as laborers and caregivers (FAO et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch07_7.1.7.3.8_p1,NO_TITLE,"Water and sanitation systems are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, and damage to such systems can lead to contamination of drinking water and subsequent adverse health impacts (Howard et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2015; Sherpa et al., 2014). In areas with only very simple traditional excreta disposal facilities (e.g., latrines) and traditional sources of water (e.g., unprotected wells), the repeated occurrence of floods and other extreme events can negatively affect water quality at household and community levels and increase the burden of food- and waterborne diseases (Cissé et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2015; Kostyla et al., 2015)."

wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The indigenous population worldwide is estimated at 476 million people spread across all geographic regions of the world (FAO et al., 2021). Indigenous Peoples globally represent a large heterogeneity of people in terms of living conditions and social determinants of health. There is no simple definition of who is indigenous. In this text, we refer to Indigenous Peoples as people self-identified and organised as indigenous, according to the principles of the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA), an international non-governmental organisation (NGO) with observer status at the United Nations (UN). Indigenous Peoples are described as ‘distinct social and cultural groups that share collective ancestral ties to the lands and natural resources where they live, occupy or from which they have been displaced’ (World Bank, 2021). A common experience among Indigenous Peoples are historical traumas related to overseas and/or settler/industrial colonisation."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Studies on climate change as it affects the health of Indigenous Peoples generally focus on non-displaced indigenous groups; that is, Indigenous Peoples maintaining culturally important elements of a land-based traditional lifestyle. Here we use an eco-medicine perspective in which the impacts of climate change on health are divided into primary, secondary and tertiary effects, as discussed below (Butler and Harley, 2010). Many analyses of indigenous health in relation to climate change use the One Health concept (Mackenzie and Jeggo, 2019; see Section 7.1.5)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p4,NO_TITLE,Current Impacts of Climate Change on Health and Well-Being of Indigenous Peoples
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Primary health effects of climate change include the immediate physical effects on human health, such as health hazards due to high temperatures, extreme weather events or accidents from exposure to climate-related hazards. For example, in arid and semiarid areas, an increased frequency of severe droughts is associated with immediate health problems related to overheating and lack of water for drinking, sanitation and livestock (Hall and Crosby, 2020; Mamo, 2020; Rankoana, 2021). In many cases, the possibilities for Indigenous Peoples to apply traditional strategies to mitigate droughts by migration are limited by competing land use, environmental protection and national borders, with many examples across Africa (Mamo, 2020). In the Jordan River Valley, the second most water stressed area in the world, water resources are not equally distributed to Indigenous Bedouin people, amplifying their immediate health threat during predictable as well as unpredictable droughts (Mamo, 2020)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"In Arctic and sub-Arctic areas, higher temperatures with increased numbers of freeze–thaw cycles during the winter means increased occurrences of transport-related accidents in indigenous communities due to weaker ice on travel routes that cross lakes, rivers and the sea, along with changes in the snow cover and increased risk of avalanches (Durkalec et al., 2015; Jaakkola et al., 2018). Impeded access to healthcare during extreme weather conditions is a primary health risk for Indigenous Peoples living in remote areas (Amstislavski et al., 2013; Hall and Crosby, 2020; Mamo, 2020)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Pastoralists in many regions may experience changes in livestock behaviour due to climate change, leading to increased mobility-related health hazards (Jaakkola et al., 2018; Mamo, 2020). Indigenous Peoples living in low-lying coastal areas and small island states face long-term risk of flooding and the stresses of resettlement (Maldonado et al., 2021; McMichael and Powell, 2021)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Extreme rainfall, flooding, storms, heatwaves and wildfires lead to individual health hazards that may include injuries and thermal and respiratory traumas (Mamo, 2020) There are many examples when emergency responses to extreme events have ignored the needs of displaced Indigenous Peoples (Mendez et al., 2020; Maldonado et al., 2021). Population-based quantitative studies documenting the direct effects of these events on Indigenous Peoples are rare. In Mexico, respiratory diseases are almost twice as common among Indigenous Peoples compared to non-Indigenous Peoples (de Leon-Martinez et al., 2020). In Alaska and northern Canada, alarming levels of respiratory stress and disease have been reported among Inuit and First Nation communities in relation to wildfires (Howard et al., 2021), as well as increased mould in houses due to flooding resulting from increased precipitation (Furgal and Seguin, 2006; Harper et al., 2015; Norton-Smith et al., 2016 ). Climate- and housing-related respiratory stress is also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection, which has been highlighted in recent literature from an indigenous health perspective (de Leon-Martinez et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"Secondary effects relate to ecosystem changes, for example, the increased risk of the acute spread of air-, soil-, vector-, food-, and waterborne infectious diseases (Hueffer et al., 2019). Higher proportions of climate-related infectious diseases are reported among indigenous groups compared to their non-indigenous neighbours, with examples from Torres Strait, Australia, showing a greater proportion of tuberculosis, dengue, Ross River virus, melioidosis, and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections (Hall et al., 2021) and in the Republic of Sakha, Russia, high levels of zoonoses (Huber et al., 2020a). Increasing levels of livestock and canine diseases are also reported (Mamo, 2020; Bogdanova et al., 2021; Hillier et al., 2021). Another secondary health effect is an increase in human–animal conflicts, for example human–elephant conflicts in Namibia due to plant food scarcity (Mamo, 2020), human–bear conflicts in Arctic regions within Canada (Wilder et al., 2017), human–tiger conflicts in Bangladesh (Haque et al., 2015) and increased predatory pressure on Indigenous Peoples’ livestock and game worldwide (Haque et al., 2015; Jaakkola et al., 2018; Mukeka et al., 2019; Mamo, 2020; Terekhina et al., 2021). Undernutrition and metabolic disturbances associated with overnutrition and obesity due to the decreased availability or safety of local and traditional foods and increased dependency on imported substitutes affect many Indigenous Peoples worldwide (Amstislavski et al., 2013; Zavaleta et al., 2018; Houde et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020; Akande et al., 2021; Bogdanova et al., 2021; Bryson et al., 2021) and are especially severe for pregnant women and small children (Mamo, 2020; Olson and Metz, 2020; Bryson et al., 2021); these are amplified by the combination of warming and the COVID-19 situation (Zavaleta-Cortijo et al., 2020). Decreased access to wild plants and animals as food sources and medicine due to climate change is another threat to the health and wellness of indigenous communities (Greenwood and Lindsay, 2019; Mamo, 2020; CIAT and and, 2021; Rankoana, 2021; Teixidor-Toneu et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Tertiary effects relate to culture-wide changes, for example, all forms of malnutrition due to climate-driven changes in food systems and anxiety, mental illness and suicidal thoughts related to cultural and spiritual losses. A wide range of tertiary, culture-related effects of climate change have been documented for Indigenous Peoples. These include anxiety, distress and other mental health impacts due to direct and indirect processes of dispossession of land and culture related to the combination of climate change and other factors (Richmond and Ross, 2009; Bowles, 2015; Norton-Smith et al., 2016 ; Jaakkola et al., 2018; Fuentes et al., 2020; Mamo, 2020; Middleton et al., 2020b; Middleton et al., 2020a; Olson and Metz, 2020; Timlin et al., 2021). Increased risks of conflict and abuse, including violence and homicide against females, and/or conflicts resulting from environmental activism, are other tertiary health threats for Indigenous Peoples (Mamo, 2020). Between 2017 and 2019, close to 500 indigenous people were killed for activism in 19 different countries (Mamo, 2020). In Uganda, climate change drives indigenous men to increase their distance and time from home and their families in search of water and food, leading to an increase in sexual violence against indigenous women and girls in their communities (Mamo, 2020)."

In an Inuit community, for instance, women reported a higher level of mental stress related to climate change than men (Harper et al., 2015). Adverse pregnancy outcomes and altered developmental trajectories have also been associated with climate change (Hall et al., 2021). Indigenous Batwa women in Uganda reported experiencing more severe circumstances of food insecurity during pregnancy due to drought and unpredictable seasons negatively impacting agricultural practices (de Leon-Martinez et al., 2020). More studies with a gender perspective on climate change as a determinant of Indigenous Peoples’ health are needed, along with the perspectives of indigenous children and youth, displaced individuals and communities in urban settings (Kowalczewski and Klein, 2018)."

This is a knowledge gap with lasting implications not only on physical environments (Guo et al., 2018).

wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p22,NO_TITLE,Four Brief Case Studies to Illustrate the Innovativeness of Indigenous Peoples’ Adaptation to Climate Risks
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p24,NO_TITLE,"Wildfires are a main cause of deforestation in Israel, and in recent years climate stress has decreased the forest resilience to fires (Klein et al., 2019). The original landscape, a shrubland or maquis consisting mostly of oak and Pistacia, has been used since time immemorial as grazing land for goats, sheep and camels belonging to Indigenous Bedouin people (Degen and El-Meccawi, 2009). Competing land use has reshaped the landscape with pine monocultures and cattle farming, reducing the availability of land suitable for herding goats the indigenous way (Perevolotsky and Sheffer, 2011). In addition, since 1950, plant protection legislation has decreased Bedouin forest pastoralism in Israel by defining indigenous black goats as an environmental threat (FAOLEX, 2021). In nature reserves where no human interference has been allowed, these areas have regenerated into herbaceous shrublands susceptible to wildfires (Turco et al., 2017). Meanwhile, urbanised Bedouin exist on lower incomes and experience higher levels of unemployment compared to other citizens, and some keep non-pastoralised livestock in cities as a strategy for food sovereignty (Degen and El-Meccawi, 2009). In 2019, many severe wildfires occurred in Israel due to extreme heatwaves and, in response, plant protection legislation was repealed, allowing Bedouin pastoralists to graze their goats in areas from which they had been excluded. The amount of combustible undergrowth subsequently decreased, reducing the risk for wildfire and their related impacts, while simultaneously facilitating indigenous food sovereignty among the Bedouin (Mamo, 2020)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p27,NO_TITLE,"In the central interior of what is now known as British Columbia (BC), 2017 was an especially severe wildfire season, with over 1.3 million hectares of land burned and 65,000 people displaced (Timler and Sandy, 2020). The unceded and ancestral lands of the Tsilhqot’in, Dakelh and Secwépemc were impacted by two of the largest fires (Verhaeghe et al., 2017). Communities affected by the BC wildfires subsequently started indigenous gardens closer to home, to protect medicine and food plants and thereby sustaining relationships with these plants, the land and the community (Timler and Sandy, 2020). As there are cultural teachings for fire to cleanse the territory and the land, community members and plants previously isolated became better connected because of the wildfires. The regrowth of plants is part of the healing relationship between plants, people and other animals (Timler and Sandy, 2020). The wildfires were seen as events to catalyse action and emphasise the importance of relationships to support foodways and gardening as responsibility."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p28,NO_TITLE,"Widening our understanding of gardening in the face of climate change and colonialism can support health and healing for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples. Gardening as a means of indigenous food sovereignty has long been utilised by a variety of indigenous groups within Canada and elsewhere to address circumstances of chronic food insecurity and support health and wellness (Johnson-Jennings et al., 2020; Timler and Sandy, 2020). The concept of gardening as both a Euro-Western agricultural practice and indigenous practice encourages an increased reverence and connection with the land and wider engagement with the natural world (Whyte, 2018). Much of this is because Indigenous knowledge and land management practices encompass processes that are known to be synergistic and sustainable (Ottenhoff, 2021). Indigenous worldviews offer a different perspective on social resilience to environmental change, one that is based on moral relationships of responsibility that connect humans to animals, plants and habitats (Grey and Patel, 2015). These responsible practices not only ensure ecosystems are maintained for future generations; they centre the moral qualities necessary to carry out the responsibilities of consent, reciprocity and trust. Moral qualities of responsibility are the foundation for relying on each other when facing environmental challenges (Whyte, 2018; Miltenburg et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p29,NO_TITLE,"To restore these sustainable relationships, a resurgence is needed of community roles and responsibilities (Cidro et al., 2015) as well as a reconsideration of the concept of food security and the role of gardening within diverse indigenous contexts. Offering individual or community gardening as a solution to ‘food insecurity’, a Eurocentric measure of health, ignores colonial contexts and sovereignty (Borrows, 2019; Timler and Sandy, 2020). Indigenous communities have historic, ongoing and evolving gardening and food gathering practices, including a wide variety of land-based and aquatic foods (Turner and Turner, 2008; Mt. Pleasant, 2016). Euro-Western science is beginning to recognise these longstanding relationships (Kamal et al., 2015; Hatfield et al., 2018; Timler and Sandy, 2020). For many indigenous communities, reconnecting with ancestral foodways holds the potential not only to address food security but to provide the community cohesion, self-esteem and wellness (Gordon et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p32,NO_TITLE,"In sub-Saharan Africa, climate change is an emerging risk factor for undernutrition, particularly in countries that rely on subsistence agriculture (Sorgho et al., 2020). In Uganda, negative health effects associated with climate change are being observed, including increased rates of food insecurity, with the highest rates recorded among the Batwa of Kanungu District, where 97% of households are severely food insecure (Patterson et al., 2017). For many Indigenous Peoples, food security in a changing climate is a growing concern (Guyot et al., 2006; Patterson et al., 2017). Locally harvested indigenous foods have been adversely impacted by climate change, while connection to land is being disrupted by the processes of colonisation, discrimination and lack of representation in decision-making groups, thereby restricting adaptive capacity for indigenous communities (Bryson et al., 2021). In Uganda, the Indigenous Batwa have experienced significant disparities resulting from the forced eviction from their territory, dispossessing them of their land and the ability to provide indigenous foods to their families (Patterson et al., 2017; Scarpa et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p33,NO_TITLE,"Nutrient-specific knowledge of indigenous foods is limited among many communities in Africa . A new food composition database in Uganda was constructed in dialogue with knowledge keepers from the Batwa and Bakiga Peoples to assess the nutrient density of these locally harvested foods (Scarpa et al., 2021). As in other lower resource settings, no food composition tables are available for southwestern Uganda. The only existing food database was designed for central and eastern Uganda; it does not include common recipes and local foods consumed by Batwa and Bakiga communities (Scarpa et al., 2021). Using a community-based approach and collaboration with local nutritionists, a list of foods was collected through focus group discussions, an individual dietary survey and market assessments. Including these locally familiar foods ultimately supports a focus on indigenous justice and the importance of valuing indigenous food systems and practices, which in many contexts have been found to have superior nutritional and environmental benefits for communities (Kuhnlein et al., 2013; Scarpa et al., 2021). This new and unique database including indigenous foods will not only guide local nutrition and health initiatives, but also contribute towards policies related to indigenous food sovereignty and resilience to climate change."

Climate change is threatening core conditions for reindeer herding, with Sami pastoralists describing the situation as ‘facing the limit of resilience’ (Furberg et al., 2011). Sami pastoralists stress that an ability to continue reindeer herding is a prerequisite for their mental and spiritual health (Jaakkola et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch07_box-7.1_p36,NO_TITLE,"In a pilot project for climate adaptation of reindeer herding run by the Swedish Sami Parliament, reindeer herding management plans (in Swedish, renbruksplaner) were used as a tool to develop strategies for climate adaptation (Walkepää, 2019). Four Sami reindeer herding cooperatives participated in the pilot study. They all agreed that climate change means that grazing patterns need to change. Traditionally, mountain reindeer graze in the Scandinavian mountains close to Norway in summer and in the coastal areas close to the Gulf of Bothnia in winter, representing a total migration route of up to 400 kilometres one-way. Rising temperatures are causing spring to occur earlier in the coastal winter grazing land before the calving areas in the summer land are suitable for grazing and free from snow. When the snow cover disappears, the herds are dispersed, so it is important to migrate while snow is still present (Walkepää, 2019). Migration routes are being destabilised by weaker ice cover on water and by hazardous weather events. Competing land use due to infrastructure, extractive industries, tourism, and energy production makes it difficult to find alternative grazing land. Supplementary feeding and increased use of trucks to transport reindeer is one result. Herds that are dispersed due to bad snow conditions have an increased exposure to predators (Walkepää, 2019; Uboni et al., 2020). By working strategically to secure adequate winter grazing and reduce fragmentation of grazing areas more generally represents win-win strategies for achieving decreased mental stress levels while reducing herders’ consumption of fossil fuels (Walkepää, 2019)."

A key challenge in quantifying the specific relationship between climate and health outcomes is distinguishing the extent to which observed changes in prevalence of a climate-sensitive disease or condition are attributable directly or indirectly to climatic factors as opposed to other non-climatic causal factors (Ebi et al., 2020). A subsequent challenge is then determining the extent to which those observed changes in health outcomes associated with climate are attributable to events or conditions associated with natural climate variability compared to persistent human induced shifts in the mean and/or the variability characteristics of climate (i.e., anthropogenic climate change). The context within which the impacts of climate change affect health outcomes and health systems is described in this chapter as being a function of risk, which is in turn a product of interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Chapter 1), with the impacts in turn having the potential to reinforce vulnerability and/or exposure to risk (Figure 7.4)."

Burden for each disease/health outcome is estimated by adding together the number of years of life lost (YLL) by a person because of early death and the number of years of life lived with disability (YLD) from the considered outcome. The resulting statistic, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) represents the loss of one year of life lived in full health. The total global burden of disease (Vos et al., 2020), expressed in DALYs, is what the world’s health systems must manage and is reported annually in Global Burden of Disease Study (Vos et al., 2020). The estimated current global burden of climate-sensitive diseases and conditions described in this chapter, and the geographical regions most affected, are summarised in Table Box 7.2.1. As was observed in Chapter 11 (‘Human Health’) of AR5, the ‘background climate-related disease burden of a population is often the best single indicator of vulnerability to climate change – doubling of risk of disease in a low disease population has much less absolute impact than doubling of the disease when the background rate is high.’"

Many infectious agents, vectors, non-human reservoir hosts, and pathogen replication rates can be sensitive to ambient climatic conditions. Elevated proliferation and reproduction rates at higher temperatures, longer transmission season, changes in ecology and climate-related migration of vectors, reservoir hosts or human populations contribute to this climate sensitivity (Rocklöv & Dubrow, 2020; Semenza and Paz, 2021). Age-standardised DALY rates for many VBDs have decreased over the last decade due to factors unrelated to climate. Vulnerability to VBD is strongly determined by sociodemographic factors (e.g., children, the elderly and pregnant women are at greater risk) with exposure to vectors being strongly influenced by various factors including socioeconomic status, housing quality, healthcare access, susceptibility, occupational setting, recreational activity, conflicts and displacement ( Rocklöv & Dubrow, 2020; Semenza and Paz, 2021).

Transmission rates of malaria are directly influenced by climatic and weather variables such as temperature, with non-climatic socioeconomic factors and health system responses counteracting the climatic drivers  (very high confidence). The burden of malaria is greatest in Africa, where more than 90% of all malaria-related deaths occur (M’Bra et al., 2018; Caminade et al., 2019). Between 2007 and 2017, DALYs for malaria have decreased by 39% globally. Malaria is mainly caused by five distinct species of plasmodium parasite (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium knowlesi) and is transmitted by Anopheline mosquitoes. Evidence suggests that in highland areas of Colombia and Ethiopia, malaria has shifted in warmer years towards higher altitudes, indicating that, without intervention, malaria will increase at higher elevations as the climate warms (Siraj et al., 2014; Midekisa et al., 2015). Each year, local outbreaks of malaria occur due to importation in areas from which it was once eradicated, such as Europe, but the risk of re-establishment is considered low."
wg2_ch07_7.2.2.1 _p4,NO_TITLE,"The transmission of dengue fever is linked to climatic and weather variables such as temperature, relative humidity and rainfall (high confidence).

Since 1950, global dengue burden has grown and is attributable to a combination of climate-associated expansion in the geographic range of the vector species and non-climatic factors such as globalised air traffic, urbanisation and ineffective vector abatement measures. Temperature, relative humidity and rainfall variables are significantly and positively associated with increased dengue case incidence and/or transmission rates globally, including in Vietnam (Phung et al., 2015; Xuan le et al., 2014), Thailand (Xu et al., 2019a), India (Mutheneni et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2018; Mala and Jat, 2019), Indonesia (Kesetyaningsih et al., 2018), the Philippines (Carvajal et al., 2018), the USA (Lopez et al., 2018; Pena-Garcia et al., 2017; Duarte et al., 2019; Rivas et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2016a), Jordan (Obaidat and Roess, 2018) and Timor-Leste (Wangdi et al., 2018). Variation in winds, sea surface temperatures and rain over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (El Niño-Southern Oscillation; ENSO) have been linked to increased dengue incidence in Colombia (Quintero-Herrera et al., 2015; McGregor and Ebi, 2018; Pramanik et al., 2020) and its interannual variation successfully forecasted in Ecuador using ENSO indices as predictors (Petrova et al., 2019).

Increased use of household water storage containers during the drought is correlated with a range expansion of Aedes aegypti during this period, increasing household exposure to the vector (Paz and Semenza, 2016). Changing climate also appears to be a risk factor for the spread of Japanese encephalitis to higher altitudes in Nepal (Ghimire and Dhakal, 2015) and in southwest China (Zhao et al., 2014).

As with WBDs, FBD outbreaks can follow multiple causal pathways as climatic risk factors interact with food production and distribution systems, urbanisation and population growth, resource and energy scarcity, decreasing agricultural productivity, price volatility, modification of diet trends, new technologies and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (Lake, 2018; Yeni and Alpas, 2017).

The drivers of pneumonia incidence are complex and include a range of possible non-climate as well as climate factors. For example, chronic diseases (e.g., lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma), other comorbidities, a weak immune system, age, gender, community, passive smoking, air pollution and childhood immunisation may confound the climate pneumonia relationship (Miyayo et al., 2021)."

In tropical and subtropical areas of Africa and Asia, pneumonia incidence has been reported to be higher during the rainy season, pointing to a positive association between pneumonia patterns and temperature and precipitation (Chowdhury et al., 2018a; Lim and Siow, 2018; Paynter et al., 2010)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"The degree to which the timing, duration and magnitude of local influenza virus epidemics is dependent on climate factors is poorly understood (Lam et al., 2020). Further, a host of non-climate confounders are likely  to influence the incidence of seasonal influenza (Caini et al., 2018). This poses a number of challenges for making reliable climate-based epidemiological forecasts for influenza (Gandon et al., 2016). Although no association between anomalous climate conditions and influenza have been reported in some locations (Lam et al., 2020), generally, low winter temperatures and humidity in temperate regions and periods of high humidity and precipitation in the tropical and subtropical regions have been linked to outbreaks of influenza (Deyle et al., 2016; Soebiyanto et al., 2015; Tamerius et al., 2013). However, the climate sensitivity of influenza may be more complex than this, with both high and low humidity; the amount and intensity of precipitation; solar activity and/or sunshine; and latitude also being important (Axelsen et al., 2014; Chong et al., 2020b; Geier et al., 2018; Park et al., 2019; Qu, 2016; Smith et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017 c; Zhao et al., 2018a). Moreover, the shape of the climate variable influenza relationship may be conditioned on influenza type (Chong et al., 2020a). Further, distinct periods of weather variability characterised by rapid inter-daily changes in temperature may act as precursors to influenza epidemics as has been demonstrated for the marked 2017–2018 influenza season and others across the USA (Liu et al., 2020a; Zhao et al., 2018a). For the eastern Mediterranean, such rapid weather changes are associated with the ‘Cyprus Low’, with the timing and magnitude of seasonal influenza related to the interannual frequency of this particular weather regime (Hochman et al., 2021). Potentially, large-scale modes of climatic variability such as ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which strongly moderate the frequency of weather regimes in some parts of the world, could affect influenza pandemic dynamics. However, studies conducted to date report inconsistent results. Some point to an increased (decreased) severity of seasonal influenza during El Niño (La Niña) (Oluwole, 2015; Oluwole, 2017), while others find influenza to be more severe and frequent when coinciding with La Niña events (Chun et al., 2019; Flahault et al., 2016; Shaman and Lipsitch, 2013). This raises the possibly of non-stationary associations between large-scale modes of climatic variability and influenza dynamics (Onozuka and Hagihara, 2015) as found for other diseases (Kreppel et al., 2014), something that might be expected given El Niño’s time-varying impact on global precipitation and temperature fields and associated impacts on health outcomes (McGregor and Ebi, 2018)."

NCDs constitute a large group of diseases driven principally by environmental, lifestyle and other factors; those identified as being climate sensitive include non-infectious respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and endocrine diseases including diabetes. Additionally, there are potential interactions between multiple climate-sensitive NCDs and food security, nutrition and mental health. The literature on climate change and NCDs continues to develop.

Exposure to these known carcinogens can occur through multiple environmental media and can be increased by climate change, for example through increased flooding related to extreme precipitation events and mobilisation of sediment where carcinogens have accumulated (León et al., 2017; Santiago and Rivas, 2012). In addition, there is concern that changes in ultraviolet light exposure related to shifts in precipitation may increase the incidence of malignant melanoma, particularly for outdoor workers (Modenese et al., 2018).

Exposure to these known carcinogens can occur through multiple environmental media and can be increased by climate change, for example through increased flooding related to extreme precipitation events and mobilisation of sediment where carcinogens have accumulated (León et al., 2017; Santiago and Rivas, 2012). In addition, there is concern that changes in ultraviolet light exposure related to shifts in precipitation may increase the incidence of malignant melanoma, particularly for outdoor workers (Modenese et al., 2018). Other harmful pathways include migration of and increased exposure to liver flukes, which cause hepatobiliary cancer (Prueksapanich et al., 2018) and the introduction of infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis that increase cancer risk due to climate-related migration (Ahmed et al., 2014). Increased exposure to carcinogenic toxins via multiple pathways is also a concern. Aflatoxin exposure, for example, is expected to increase in Europe (Moretti et al., 2019), India (Shekhar et al., 2018), Africa (Gnonlonfin et al., 2013; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2016) and North America (Wu et al., 2011).

Evidence suggests that the local heat loss response of skin blood flow is affected by diabetes-related impairments, resulting in lower elevations in skin blood flow in response to a heat or pharmacological stimulus. Thermoregulatory sweating may also be diminished by type-2 diabetes, impairing the body’s ability to transfer heat from its core to the environment (Xu et al., 2019b).

The health impacts of heat manifest clearly in periods of extreme heat often codified as heatwaves. For example, heatwaves across Europe (2003), Russia (2010), India (2015) and Japan (2018) resulted in significant death tolls and hospitalisations (McGregor et al., 2017; Hayashida et al., 2019).

Further, for the 150 most populated cities of the world, a 500% increase in the exposure to extreme heat events occurred over the 1980–2017 period (Li et al., 2021), while for the 1986–2005 period, the total exposure to dangerous heat in Africa’s 173 largest cities was 4.2 billion person-days yr –1 (Rohat et al., 2019a). Globally the present exposure to heatwave events is estimated to be 14.8 billion person-days yr –1, with the greatest cumulative exposures measured in person-days occurring across southern Asia (7.19 billion), sub-Saharan Africa (1.43 billion), and north Africa and the Middle East (1.33 billion) (Jones et al., 2018)."

For 2019, the GBD report estimates the burden of DALYs attributable to low temperature was 2.2 times greater than the burden attributable to high temperature. However, this global figure obscures important regional variations. Countries with a high sociodemographic index—mainly mid-latitude high-income temperate to cool climate countries— were found to have a cold-related burden 15.4 times greater than the heat-related burden, while for warm lower-income regions, such as south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the heat-related burden was estimated to be 1.7 times and 3.6 times greater, respectively (Murray et al., 2020). For countries where data availability permits, there is evidence that extreme heat (and extreme cold) leads to higher rates of premature deaths (Armstrong et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Costa et al., 2017)."

Evidence suggests a general decrease in the impact of heat on daily mortality (Diaz et al., 2018; Kinney, 2018; Miron et al., 2015), a decline in the relative risk attributable to heat (Åström et al., 2018; Barreca et al., 2016; Petkova et al., 2014) and an increase in the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) (Åström et al., 2018; Folkerts et al., 2020; Follos et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2018; Todd and Valleron, 2015; Yin et al., 2019). It is difficult to draw conclusions regarding trends in heat sensitivity for low- to middle-income countries and specific vulnerable groups as these are under-represented in the literature (Sheridan and Allen, 2018). Trends in heat sensitivity are generally believed  to be scale and situation dependent, but there is considerable variability in changes in heat sensitivity as measured by trends in heat-related mortality or MMT (Follos et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2019a; Lee et al., 2021), with notable variability across different population groups (Lu et al., 2021)."

In the worst cases, these lead to organ failure and death (Mora et al., 2017a; Mora et al., 2017b). Excess deaths during extreme heat events occur predominantly in older individuals and are overwhelmingly cardiovascular in origin  (very high confidence). A higher occurrence of CVD mortality in association with prolonged period of low temperatures has been well documented globally (Giorgini et al., 2017; Stewart et al., 2017); however, there is growing evidence that cardiovascular deaths are more related to heat events than cold spells (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2015a; Bunker et al., 2016). While there is strong association between ambient temperature and cardiovascular events globally, there are complex interactions and modulators of individual response (Wang et al., 2017 b). Further, some CVD morbidity sub-groups such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke hospitalisation display temperature sensitivity while others do not (Bao et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016). Although older adults have inherent sensitivities to temperature-related health impacts (Bunker et al., 2016; Phung et al., 2016), children can also be affected by extreme heat (Xu et al., 2014). Cardiovascular capacity or health is also a critical determinant of individual health outcomes (Schuster et al., 2017). Medications to treat CVDs, such as diuretics and beta-blockers, may impair resilience to heat stress (Stewart et al., 2017). Other mediating factors in the causal pathway range from alcohol consumption (Cusack et al., 2011; Epstein and Yanovich, 2019) and obesity (Speakman, 2018) to pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia, and urban characteristics (Chen et al., 2019; Sera et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.4.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Under extreme heat conditions, increases in hospitalisations have been observed for fluid disorders, renal failure, urinary tract infections, septicaemia, general heat stroke as well as unintentional injuries (Borg et al., 2017; Phung et al., 2017; Goggins and Chan, 2017; Hayashida et al., 2019; Hopp et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2018; Kampe et al., 2016; McTavish et al., 2018; Ponjoan et al., 2017; van Loenhout et al., 2018). Hospitalisations and mortality due to respiratory disorders also occur during heat events with the interactive role of air quality being important for some locations but not others (Krug et al., 2019; Pascal et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2019). Increased levels of heat-related hospitalisation also manifest in elevated levels of emergency service calls (Cheng et al., 2016; Guo, 2017; Papadakis et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2020)."

Although most studies of heat-related sports injuries refer to high-income countries, these point to an increasing number of heat injuries with widening participation in sport and an increasing frequency of extreme heat events. The highest rates of exertional heat illness are reported for endurance type events (running, cycling and adventure races), American football and athletics (Gamage et al., 2020; Grundstein et al., 2017; Kerr et al., 2020; McMahon et al., 2021; Yeargin et al., 2019). The health, safety and productivity consequences of working in extreme heat are widespread (Ma et al., 2019; Morabito et al., 2021; Kjellstrom et al., 2019; Orlov et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021; Vanos et al., 2019; Varghese et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020). Occupational heat strain in outdoor workers manifests as dehydration, mild reduction in kidney function, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, reduced brain function, loss of concentration and discomfort (Al-Bouwarthan et al., 2020; Boonruksa et al., 2020; Habibi et al., 2021; Levi et al., 2018; Venugopal et al., 2021; Xiang et al., 2014). In the case of armed forces, a global review of the available literature points to a slightly higher incidence of heat stroke in men compared to women but a higher proportion of heat intolerance and greater risk of exertional heat illness amongst women (Alele et al., 2020). There is also some evidence that for healthcare workers, the risk of occupational heat stress grew during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the need to wear personal protective equipment (Foster et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Messeri et al., 2021). Based on a systematic review of the literature, one study estimates global costs from heat-related lost work time were USD 280 billion in 1995 and USD 311 billion in 2010, with low- and middle-income countries and countries with warmer climates experiencing greater losses as a proportion of gross domestic project (GDP) (Borg et al., 2021). Other global level assessments note an increase in the potential hours of work lost due to heat over the 2000–2018 period; in 2018, 133.6 billion potential work hours were lost, amounting to 45 billion hours more than in 2000 (Watts et al., 2019). For China, heat-related productivity losses have been estimated at 9.9 billion hours in 2019, equivalent to 0.5% of the total national work hours for that year, with Guangdong province, one of the warmest regions in China, accounting for almost a quarter of the losses (Cai et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.4.1_p10,NO_TITLE,"Wide ranging knowledge regarding the specific detection of heat- and cold-related mortality/morbidity and its attribution to observed climate change is lacking . Although there has been an observed increase in winter-season temperatures for a number of regions, to date there is variable evidence for a consequential reduction in winter mortality and susceptibility to cold over time due to milder winters; some countries demonstrate decreasing trends, while other countries show stable or even increasing trends in cold-attributable mortality fractions over time (e.g., Arbuthnott et al. (2020); Åström et al. (2013); Diaz et al. (2019); Hajat (2017); Hanigan et al. (2021); Lee et al. (2018b)). While there is a burgeoning literature on the attribution of extreme heat events to climate change (e.g., Vautard et al. (2020)), the number of studies that assess the extent to which observed changes in heat-related mortality may be attributable to climate change is small (Ebi et al., 2020). During the 2003 European heatwave, anthropogenic climate change increased the risk of heat-related mortality by approximately 70% and 20% for London and Paris, respectively (Mitchell et al., 2016). For the severe heat event across Egypt in 2015, the impact on human discomfort was 69% (±17%) more likely due to anthropogenic climate change (Mitchell, 2016), and for Stockholm, Sweden, it has been estimated that mortality due to temperature extremes for 1980 to 2009 was double what would have occurred without climate change (Åström et al., 2013). To date there has only been one multi-country attempt to quantify the heat-related human health impacts that have already occurred due to climate change. Based on an analysis of 732 locations spanning 43 countries for the 1991–2018 period, the study found that on average 37.0% (inter-quartile range 20.5–76.3%) of warm-season heat-related deaths can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, equivalent to an average mortality rate of 2.2/100,000 (median: 1.67/100,000; interquartile range: 1.08–2.34/100,000). Regions with a high attributed percentage (> 50%) include southern and western Asia (Iran and Kuwait), Southeast Asia (Philippines and Thailand) and several countries in Central and South America. Those with lower values (< 35%) include Western Europe (the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland), eastern Europe (Moldova, the Czech Republic and Romania), southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain), North America (USA) and eastern Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) (Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). Due to data restrictions, some of the poorest and most susceptible regions to climate change and increases in heat exposure, such as west and east Africa (Asefi-Najafabady et al., 2018; Sylla et al., 2018) and south Asia, could not be included in the analysis (Mitchell, 2021)."

Certain groups, including Indigenous Peoples, children and the elderly (Ahmed et al., 2020) are at greater risk for a wide range of injuries. Extreme events impose substantial disease burden directly as a result of traumatic injuries, drowning and burns and large mental health burdens associated with displacement (Fullilove, 1996), depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the overall injury burden associated with extreme weather is not known. It is known that the Asia-Pacific region has experienced the highest relative burden of injuries from extreme weather in recent decades (Hashim and Hashim, 2016)."

Rates can be much higher; mortality incidence in Puerto Rico and Dominica from extreme weather were 90.2 and 43.7 per 100,000 population in 2017, respectively (Eckstein et al., 2017). Not all of these deaths are from injuries, and the proportion of mortality and morbidity associated with injuries varies by location and hazard. One review found that one-year post-event prevalence rates for injuries associated with extreme events (floods, droughts, heatwaves and storms) in developing countries ranged from 1.4% to 37.9% (Rataj et al., 2016). Other literature has documented an increase in the risk of motor vehicle accidents in association with extreme precipitation (Liu et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2019), temperature (Leard and Roth, 2019) and sandstorms (Islam et al., 2019) and an increased risk of traumatic occupational injuries associated with temperature extremes, particularly extreme heat, likely from fatigue and decreased psychomotor performance (Varghese et al., 2019)."

Approximately 120 million people are exposed to coastal flooding annually (Nicholls et al., 2007), causing an estimated 12,000 deaths (Shultz et al., 2005), and there is significant concern for worsening flooding associated with climate change (Shultz et al., 2018a; Shultz et al., 2018b; Woodward and Samet, 2018) but very limited quantification of attributable burden.

Undernutrition exists when a combination of insufficient food intake, health, and care conditions results in one or more of the following: underweight for age, short for age (stunted), thin for height (wasted), or functionally deficient in vitamins and/or minerals (micronutrient malnutrition or ‘hidden hunger’).

Mercury methylation processes in aquatic environments have been found to be exacerbated by ocean warming, coupled with more acidic and anoxic sediments (FAO, 2020). Consumption of mercury-contaminated fish has been found to be linked to neurological disorders due to methyl mercury poisoning (i.e., Minamata disease) that is associated with climate change-contaminant interactions that alter the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of toxic and fat-soluble persistent organic pollutants and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Alava et al., 2017) in seafood and marine mammals (medium confidence).

The pathways through which climatic events affect mental health are varied, complex and inter-connected with other non-climatic influences that create vulnerability (Figure 7.6). The climatic exposure may be direct, such as experiencing an extreme weather event or prolonged high temperatures, or indirect, such as mental health consequences of undernutrition or displacement. Exposure may also be vicarious, with people experiencing decreased mental health associated with observing the impact of climate change on others or simply by learning about climate change. Non-climatic moderating influences range from an individual’s personality and pre-existing conditions, to social support, and to structural inequities (Gariepy et al., 2016; Hrabok et al., 2020; Nagy et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2016b). Depending on these background and contextual factors, similar climatic events may result in a range of potential mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, acute traumatic stress, PTSD, suicide, substance abuse and sleep problems, with conditions ranging from being mild in nature to those that require hospitalisation (Berry et al., 2010; Cianconi et al., 2020; Clayton et al., 2017; Ruszkiewicz et al., 2019; Bromet et al., 2017; Lowe, 2019).

A US study found mental health problems increased by 0.5% when average temperatures exceed 30°C, compared to averages between 25°C and 30°C; a 1°C warming over five years was associated with a 2% increase in mental health problems (Obradovich et al., 2018). Another study found a 1°C rise in monthly average temperatures over several decades was associated with a 2.1% rise in suicide rates in Mexico and a 0.7% rise in suicide rates in the USA (Burke et al., 2018).

A large body of research identifies the impacts of extreme weather events on PTSD, anxiety and depression; much of the research has been done in the USA and the UK, but a growing number of studies find evidence for similar impacts on mental health in other countries, including Spain (Foudi et al., 2017), Brazil (Alpino et al., 2016), Chile (Navarro et al., 2016), Small Island Developing States (Kelman et al., 2021) and Vietnam (Pollack et al., 2016). Approximately 20–30% of those who live through a hurricane develop depression and/or PTSD within the first few months following the event (Obradovich et al., 2018; Schwartz et al., 2015; Whaley, 2009), with similar rates for people who have experienced flooding (Waite et al., 2017; Fernandez et al., 2015). Studies conducted in South America and Asia indicate an increase in PTSD and depressive disorders after extreme weather events (Rataj et al., 2016). Evidence is lacking for African countries (Otto et al., 2017). Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to post-traumatic stress after extreme weather events (Brown et al., 2017; Hellden et al., 2021; Kousky, 2016), and increased susceptibility to mental health problems may linger into adulthood (Maclean et al., 2016)."

Sub-clinical outcomes, such as increases in anxiety, sleeplessness or substance abuse are reported in response to wildfires and extreme weather events, with impacts being pronounced among those who experience greater losses or are more directly exposed to the event; this may include first responders."
wg2_ch07_7.2.5.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Mental health impacts can emerge as result of climate impacts on economic, social and food systems (high confidence). For example, malnutrition among children has been associated with a variety of mental health problems (Adhvaryu et al., 2019; Hock et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018), as has food insecurity among adults (Lund et al., 2018). The economic impacts of droughts have been associated with increases in suicide, particularly among farmers (Carleton, 2017; Edwards et al., 2015; Vins et al., 2015); those whose occupations are likely  to be affected by climate change report that it is a source of stress that is linked to substance abuse and suicidal ideation (Kabir, 2018). Studies of Indigenous Peoples often describe food insecurity or reduced access to traditional foods as a link between climate change and reduced mental health (Middleton et al., 2020b). The loss of family members, for example due to an extreme weather event, increases the risk of mental illness (Keyes et al., 2014). Individuals in low- and middle-income countries may be more severely impacted due to lesser access to mental health services and lower financial resources to help cope with impacts compared with high-income countries (Abramson et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.5.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Anxiety about the potential risks of climate change and awareness of climate change itself can affect mental health even in the absence of direct impacts (low confidence). There is a need for more evidence about the prevalence or severity of climate change-related anxiety, sometimes called ecoanxiety, but national surveys in the USA, Europe and Australia show that people express high levels of concern and perceived harm associated with climate change (Steentjes et al., 2017; Clayton and Karazsia, 2020; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018; Helm et al., 2018; Leiserowitz et al., 2017; Reser et al., 2012; Steentjes et al., 2017). In a US sample, perceived ecological stress, defined as personal stress associated with environmental problems, predicted depressive symptoms (Helm et al., 2018); in a sample of Filipinos, climate anxiety was correlated with lower mental health (Reyes et al., 2021) and a non-random study in 25 countries showed positive correlations between negative emotions about climate change and self-rated mental health (Ogunbode et al., 2021). However, an earlier study found no correlation between climate change worry and mental health issues (Berry and Peel, 2015). Because the perceived threat of climate change is based on subjective perceptions of risk and coping ability as well as on experiences and knowledge (Bradley et al., 2014), even people who have not been directly affected may be stressed by a perception of looming danger (Clayton and Karazsia, 2020). Not surprisingly, those who have directly experienced some of the effects of climate change may be more likely to show such responses. Indigenous Peoples, whose culture and well-being tend to be strongly linked to local environments, may experience mental health effects associated with changes in environmental risks; studies suggest connections to an increase in depression, substance abuse or suicide in some Indigenous Peoples (Canu et al., 2017; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Middleton et al., 2020b; Jaakkola et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.5.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Overall, research suggests that climate change has already had negative effects on subjective well-being (medium confidence). C limate change can affect well-being through a number of pathways, including loss of access to green and blue spaces due to damage from storms, coastal erosion, drought or wildfires; heat; decreased air quality; and disruptions to one’s normal pattern of behaviour, residence, occupation or social interactions (Hayward and Ayeb-Karlsson, 2021). For example, substantial evidence shows a negative correlation between air pollution and subjective well-being or happiness (Apergis, 2018; Cunado and de Gracia, 2013; Lu, 2020; Luechinger, 2010; Menz and Welsch, 2010; Orru et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017a); in the reverse direction, there is evidence not only that time in nature but more specifically a feeling of connectedness to nature are both associated with well-being (Martin et al., 2020) and healthy ecosystems offer opportunities for health improvements (Pretty and Barton, 2020). Negative emotions such as grief—often termed ‘solastalgia’ (Albrecht et al., 2007)—are associated with the degradation of local or valued landscapes (Eisenman et al., 2015; Ellis and Albrecht, 2017; Polain et al., 2011; Tschakert et al., 2017; Tschakert et al., 2019), which may threaten cultural rituals, especially among Indigenous Peoples (Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018; Cunsolo et al., 2020). Studies conducted in the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu found qualitative and quantitative evidence of experiences of climate change and worry about the future, with negative impacts on respondents’ well-being (Asugeni et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.5.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Heat is one of the best-studied aspects of climate change observed to reduce well-being (high confidence). Higher summer temperatures are associated with decreased happiness and ratings of well-being (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Miles-Novelo and Anderson, 2019; Connolly, 2013; Noelke et al., 2016; Baylis et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020 b). A study of 1.9 million Americans (Noelke et al., 2016) found that exposure to one day averaging 21°C–27°C was associated with reduced well-being by 1.6% of a standard deviation and days above 32°C were associated with reduced well-being by 4.4% of a standard deviation relative to a reference interval of 10°C–16°C. A similar relationship between heat and mood has been observed in China, where expressed mood began to decrease when the average daily temperature was over 20°C (Wang et al., 2020 b). The causal mechanism is unclear but could be due to impacts on health, economic costs or social interactions (Belkin and Kouchaki, 2017; Osberghaus and Kühling, 2016) or reduced quality or quantity of sleep (Fujii et al., 2015; Obradovich et al., 2017; Obradovich and Migliorini, 2018). Heat has also been associated with inter-personal and inter-group aggression and increases in violent crime (Heilmann et al., 2021; Mapou et al., 2017; Tiihonen et al., 2017). For the most part, studies have measured daily response to average daily temperatures and are unable to predict whether the effect is cumulative in response to a sequence of unusually warm days. However, there is no evidence that adaptation occurs over time to eliminate the negative response to very warm temperatures (Moore et al., 2019). Some research has found a negative effect of extreme cold on well-being (Yoo et al., 2021); increasing winter temperatures associated with climate change could serve to compensate for the impact of increased summer temperatures. However, the effect of high temperatures is typically found to be stronger than the effect of low temperatures, and in some cases no detrimental impacts of cold weather are found (Almendra et al., 2019; Mullins and White, 2019)."

Heat can limit labour capacity; one study estimated that 45 billion hours of labour productivity were lost in 2018 compared to 2000 due to high temperatures (Watts et al., 2019). Both heat and air pollution also impair human capabilities through a negative effect on cognitive performance (Taylor et al., 2016b) and even impair skills acquisition, reducing the ability to learn (Park et al., 2021) and affecting marginalised groups more strongly (Park et al., 2020), although findings are inconsistent and depend in part on the nature of the task  (low confidence).

wg2_ch07_7.2.6_p2,7.2.6.1 Relative Importance of Specific Climatic Drivers of Migration and Displacement ,"A general theme across studies from all regions is that climate-related migration outcomes are diverse (high confidence)and may be manifest as decreases or increases in migration flows, and may lead to changes in the timing or duration of migration and to changes in migration source locations and destinations. Multi-country studies of climatic impacts on migration patterns in Africa have found that migration exhibits weak, inconsistent associations with variations in temperature and precipitation and that migration responses differ significantly between countries and between rural and urban areas (Gray and Wise, 2016; Mueller et al., 2020). Multi-directional findings such as these are also common in single-country studies from multiple regions (Call et al., 2017; Nawrotzki et al., 2017; Cattaneo et al., 2019; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020). The diversity of potential migration and displacement outcomes reflects (a) the variable nature of climate hazards in terms of the rate of onset, intensity, duration, spatial extent and severity of damage caused to housing, infrastructure and livelihoods and (b) the wide range of social, economic, cultural, political and other non-climatic factors that influence exposure, vulnerability, adaptation options and the contexts in which migration decisions are made (Neumann and Hermans, 2015; McLeman, 2017; Barnett and McMichael, 2018; Cattaneo et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2020) (high confidence)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.6_p3,7.2.6.1 Relative Importance of Specific Climatic Drivers of Migration and Displacement ,"Weather events and climate conditions can act as direct drivers of migration and displacement (e.g., destruction of homes by tropical cyclones) and as indirect drivers (e.g., rural income losses and/or food insecurity due to heat- or drought-related crop failures that in turn generate new population movements)  (high confidence). Extreme storms, floods and wildfires are strongly associated with high levels of short- and long-term displacement, while droughts, extreme heat and precipitation anomalies are more likely to stimulate longer-term changes in migration patterns (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020). Longer-term environmental changes attributable to anthropogenic climate change—such as higher average temperatures, desertification, land degradation, biodiversity loss and sea level rise—have had observed effects on migration and displacement in a limited number of locations in recent decades but are projected to have wider-scale impacts on future population patterns and migration, and are therefore assessed in Section 7.3.2 (Projected Risks)."

The diversity in drivers, contexts and outcomes makes it difficult to offer simple generalisations about the relationship between climate change and migration. The characteristics of climatic drivers vary in terms of the rate of onset, intensity, duration, spatial extent and severity of damage caused to housing, infrastructure and livelihoods; the potential migration responses to these are further mediated by cultural, demographic, economic, political, social and other non-climatic factors operating across multiple scales (Neumann and Hermans, 2015; McLeman, 2017; Barnett and McMichael, 2018; Cattaneo et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.6_p5,7.2.6.1 Relative Importance of Specific Climatic Drivers of Migration and Displacement ,"Climate-related migration and displacement outcomes display high variability in terms of migrant success, often reflecting pre-existing socioeconomic conditions and household wealth (high confidence). The decision to migrate or remain in place when confronted by climatic hazards is strongly influenced by the range and accessibility of alternative, in situ (i.e., non-migration) adaptation options that may be less costly or disruptive (Cattaneo et al., 2019). Migration decisions (whether climate-related or not) are typically made at the individual or household level and are influenced by a household’s perceptions of risk, social networks, wealth, age structure, health and livelihood choices (Koubi et al., 2016b; Gemenne and Blocher, 2017). Households with greater financial resources and higher levels of educational attainment have greater capacity to adapt in situ (Cattaneo and Massetti, 2019; Ocello et al., 2015) but are also better able to migrate and with greater agency once such a decision is made (Kubik and Maurel, 2016; Koubi et al., 2016b; Riosmena et al., 2018; Adams and Kay, 2019). By contrast, poor households with limited physical, social and financial resources have less capacity to adapt in situ and are often limited in their migration options (Nawrotzki and DeWaard, 2018; Suckall et al., 2017; Zickgraf et al., 2016). Thus, when poorer households do migrate after an extreme climate event, it is often in reaction to lost income or livelihood and occurs with low voluntarity (Mallick et al., 2017; Bhatta et al., 2015) and may perpetuate or amplify migrants’ socioeconomic precarity and/or their exposure to environmental hazards (Natarajan et al., 2019; see also Section 8.3.1)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.6_p6,7.2.6.1 Relative Importance of Specific Climatic Drivers of Migration and Displacement ,"Climate-related migration originates most often in rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, with migrant destinations usually being other rural areas or urban centres within their home countries (i.e., internal migration)  (medium confidence). Rural livelihoods and incomes based on farming, livestock rearing and/or natural resource collection are inherently sensitive to climate variability and change, creating greater potential for migration as a response (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2017 ; Viswanathan and Kumar, 2015). Drought events have been associated with periods of higher rural to urban migration within Mexico (Chort and de la Rupelle, 2016; Leyk et al., 2017; Nawrotzki et al., 2017; Murray-Tortarolo and Martnez, 2021) and Senegal (Nawrotzki and Bakhtsiyarava, 2017). Extreme temperatures are associated with higher rates of temporary rural out-migration in South Africa and in Bangladesh (Mastrorillo et al., 2016; Call et al., 2017). In rural Tanzania, weather-related shocks to crop production have been observed to increase the likelihood of migration but typically only for households in the middle of community wealth distribution (Kubik and Maurel, 2016). Weather-related losses in rice production have been associated with small-percentage increases in internal migration in India (Viswanathan and Kumar, 2015) and the Philippines (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2017 ). In east Africa, temporary rural–urban labour migration does not show a strong response to climatic drivers (Mueller et al., 2020). There is limited literature on mobility as adaptation in urban populations, with the focus being on resettlement of flood-prone informal settlements within cities (Kita, 2017; Tadgell et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.2.6_p7,7.2.6.1 Relative Importance of Specific Climatic Drivers of Migration and Displacement ,"Most documented examples of international climate-related migration are intra-regional movements of people between countries with shared borders (high agreement, medium evidence).  Systematic reviews find few documented examples of long-distance, inter-regional migration driven by climate events (Veronis et al., 2018; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020). One macro-economic analysis found a correlation between migrant flows from low- to high-income countries and adverse climatic events in the source country (Coniglio and Pesce, 2015). Another study found that high heat stimulates higher rates of international migration from middle-income countries but typically not from low-income countries (Cattaneo and Peri., 2016), while other studies found international climate-related migration originates primarily from agriculture-dependent countries (Cai et al., 2016; Nawrotzki and Bakhtsiyarava, 2017). Small-sample studies of migrants to Canada from Bangladesh, Haiti and sub-Saharan Africa suggest environmental factors in the source country can be a primary or secondary motivation for some migrants within larger flows of economic and family-reunification migrants (Veronis and McLeman, 2014; Mezdour et al., 2015; McLeman et al., 2017). Research on the links between climate hazards and international movements of refugees and/or asylum seekers shows differing results. One study found that asylum applications in Europe increase during climate fluctuations due to interactions with conflict (Missirian and Schlenker, 2017), and another found links between heat, drought, conflict and asylum-seeking migration originating in the Middle East between 2011 and 2015 (Abel et al., 2019). Other studies have found that asylum claims in Europe correspond minimally with climatic hazards in source countries (Schutte et al., 2021), with choices in baseline data, timeframes for analysis and methodological approaches potentially explaining the inconsistent results across studies (Boas et al., 2019). Media reports and other studies in recent years suggest that climate change has driven large numbers of migrants to the US from Central America and to Europe from the Middle East and Africa, but empirical studies were not identified for this assessment."
wg2_ch07_7.2.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Reliable global estimates of voluntary climate-related migration within and between countries are not available due to a general absence of data of this specific nature, with existing national and global datasets often lacking information on migration causation or motivation. Better data are available for involuntary displacements within countries for reasons associated with weather-related hazards. Data collected annually since 2008 on internal displacements attributed to extreme weather events by the IDMC indicate that extreme storms and floods are the two most significant weather-related drivers of population displacements globally. Because of improvements in collection sources and methods since it first began reporting data in 2008, upward trends since that year in the total reported annual number of people displaced should be treated cautiously. However, it is reasonable to conclude that the average annual rate currently exceeds 20 million people globally, with considerable interannual variation due to the frequency and severity of extreme events in heavily populated areas. Regional distribution of displacement events has been consistent throughout the IDMC data collection period (high confidence), with displacement events occurring most often in East, Southeast and south Asia; sub-Saharan Africa; the USA; and the Caribbean region (Figure 7.7).

The scale of immediate displacement from any given storm and potential for post-event migration depend heavily on the extent of damage to housing and livelihood assets and the responsive capacity of governments and humanitarian relief agencies (Saha, 2016; Islam et al., 2018; Mahajan, 2020; Spencer and Urquhart, 2018). In Bangladesh, the rural poor are most often displaced, with initial increases in short-term, labour-seeking migration followed by more permanent migration by some groups (Saha, 2016; Islam and Hasan, 2016; Islam and Shamsuddoha, 2017).

In 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused widespread damage to infrastructure and health services, and a slow recovery response by authorities was followed by the migration of tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans to Florida and New York (Zorrilla, 2017; Echenique and Melgar, 2018). In the US, coastal counties experience increased out-migration after hurricanes that flows along existing social networks (Hauer, 2017), with post-disaster reconstruction employment opportunities potentially attracting new labour migrants to affected areas (Ouattara and Strobl, 2014; Curtis et al., 2015; DeWaard et al., 2016; Fussell et al., 2018)."

In areas where flooding is especially frequent, in situ adaptations may be more common, and out-migration may temporarily decline after a flood (Afifi et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Call et al., 2017).

Such linkages are ‘multi-directional’, with studies suggesting that healthy individuals may be more likely to migrate internationally in search of economic opportunities than people in poorer health, except during adverse climatic conditions when migration rates may change across all groups, and that migrants may have different long-term health outcomes than people born in destination areas, potentially displaying a range of positive and negative health outcomes compared to non-migrants (Kennedy et al., 2015; Dodd et al., 2017; Hunter and Simon, 2017; Riosmena et al., 2017).

Data collected annually since 2008 on internal displacements attributed to extreme weather events by the IDMC indicate that extreme storms and floods are the two most significant weather-related drivers of population displacements globally. Because of improvements in collection sources and methods since it first began reporting data in 2008, upward trends since that year in the total reported annual number of people displaced should be treated cautiously. However, it is reasonable to conclude that the average annual rate currently exceeds 20 million people globally, with considerable interannual variation due to the frequency and severity of extreme events in heavily populated areas. Regional distribution of displacement events has been consistent throughout the IDMC data collection period (high confidence), with displacement events occurring most often in East, Southeast and south Asia; sub-Saharan Africa; the USA; and the Caribbean region (Figure 7.7).

Women tend to suffer disproportionately from the negative impacts of extreme climate events for reasons ranging from caregiving responsibilities to lack of control over household resources to cultural norms for attire (Belay et al., 2017; Jost et al., 2016). In many cultures, migrants are most often able-bodied, young men (Call et al., 2017; Heaney and Winter, 2016). Women wait longer to migrate because of higher social costs and risks (Evertsen and Van Der Geest, 2019) and barriers such as social structures, cultural practices, lack of education and reproductive roles (Belay et al., 2017; Afriyie et al., 2018; Evertsen and Van Der Geest, 2019)."

Migration can change household composition and structure, which in turn affects the adaptive capacity and choices of those who do not move (Rao et al., 2019a; Rao et al., 2019b; Singh, 2019). For example, when only male household members move, the remaining members of the now female-headed household must take on greater workloads (Goodrich et al., 2019; Rao et al., 2019b; Rigg and Salamanca, 2015), leading to increased workload and greater vulnerability for those left behind (Arora et al., 2017; Bhagat, 2017; Flatø et al., 2017; Lawson et al., 2019). It can, however, also increase women’s economic freedom and decision-making capacity, enhance their agency (Djoudi et al., 2016; Rao, 2019) and alter the gendered division of paid work, care and intra-household relations (Rigg et al., 2018; Singh and Basu, 2020), a process that may reduce household vulnerability to extreme climate events (Banerjee et al., 2019b)."

wg2_ch07_7.2.7.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Consistent with AR5 findings, there continues to be little observed evidence that climatic variability or change cause violent inter-state conflict. In intra-state settings, climate change has been associated with the onset of conflict, civil unrest or riots in urban settings (high agreement, medium evidence) (Ide (2020), and changes in the duration and severity of existing violent conflicts (Koubi, 2019). Climate change is conceptualised as one of many factors that interact to raise tensions (Boas and Rothe, 2016) through diverse causal mechanisms (Mach et al., 2019; Ide et al., 2020) and as part of the peace-vulnerability-development nexus (Barnett, 2019; Abrahams, 2020; Buhaug and von Uexkull, 2021). New areas of the literature assessed in this report include the security implications of responses to climate change, the gendered dynamics of conflict and exposure to violence under climate change and civil unrest in urban settings. The impact of violent conflict on vulnerability is not addressed in this chapter but does arise in other chapters (Sections 8.3.2.3, 17.2.2.2). Other chapters address non-violent conflict over changing availability and distribution of resources, for example, competing land uses and fish stocks migrating to different territories (Sections 5.8.2.3; 5.8.3, 5.9.3, 5.13, 9.8.1.1, 9.8.5.1). A commonly used definition of armed conflict is conflicts involving greater than 25 battle-related deaths in a year; this number represents the Uppsala Conflict Data Program threshold for inclusion in their database, a core resource in this field."

Inter-group inequality, and consequent relative deprivation can lead to conflict and the negative impacts of climate change lower the opportunity cost of involvement in conflict (Buhaug et al., 2020; Vestby, 2019). Potential pathways linking climate and conflict include direct impacts on physiology from heat or resource scarcity; indirect impacts of climatic variability on economic output, agricultural incomes, higher food prices and increasing migration flows; and the unintended effects of climate mitigation and adaptation policies (Koubi, 2019; Busby, 2018; Sawas et al., 2018). Relative deprivation, political exclusion and ethnic fractionalisation and ethnic grievances are other key variables (Schleussner et al., 2016; Theisen, 2017). Research shows that factors such as land tenure and competing land uses interacting with market-driven pressures and existing ethnic divisions produce conflict over land resources rather than a scarcity of natural resources caused by climate impacts such as drought (high agreement, medium evidence) (Theisen, 2017; Balestri and Maggioni, 2017; Kuusaana and Bukari, 2015; Box 8.3)."

However, they are unable to detect the impact of regional temperature increases on violence. For Africa, Van Weezel (2019) found associations between average increases in temperature and conflict risk. Caruso et al. (2016) found an association between rises in minimum temperature and violence through the impact of temperature on rice yields (Box 9.4). However, the associations between temperature and violence are weak compared to those with political and social factors (e.g., Owain and Maslin (2018)) and research focuses on areas where conflict is already present and, as such, is sensitive to selection bias (Adams et al., 2018). There is a body of literature that finds statistical associations between temperature anomalies and inter-personal violence, crime and aggression in the Global North, predominantly in the USA (e.g., Ranson (2014); Mares and Moffett (2019); Tiihonen et al. (2017); Parks et al. (2020); Section 14.4.8).

In general, research stresses the underlying economic, social and political drivers of conflict. For example, research on conflict in the Lake Chad region has demonstrated that the lake drying was only one of many factors including lack of development and infrastructure (Okpara et al., 2016; Nagarajan et al., 2018; Tayimlong, 2020). Fewer studies examine the relationship between flooding (excess water) and violence and often rely on migration as the causal factor (see below).

Different stakeholders use disasters to establish new narratives and alter public opinion (Venugopal and Yasir, 2017). Some research has demonstrated how post-disaster activities have had positive impacts on the social contract between people and the state, reducing the risk of conflict by strengthening relations between government and citizens and strengthening the citizenship of marginalised communities (Siddiqi, 2018; Pelling and Dill, 2010; Siddiqi, 2019).

Under such conditions, locally specific grievances, hunger and social inequalities can initiate or exacerbate conflicts. Food price volatility in general is not associated with violence, but sudden food price hikes have been linked to civil unrest in some circumstances (Bellemare, 2015; McGuirk and Burke, 2020; Winne and Peersman, 2019). In urban settings in Kenya, Koren et al. (2021) found an association between food and water insecurity that is mutually reinforcing and associated with social unrest (although insecurity in either food or water on its own was not).

Research points to the potential for conflict to serve as an intervening factor between climate and migration. However, the nature of the relationship is diverse and context specific. For example, displaced people and migrants may be associated with heightened social tensions in receiving areas through mechanisms such as ecological degradation, reduced access to services and a disturbed demographic balance in the host area (Rüegger and Bohnet, 2020). Ghimire et al. (2015) observed that an influx of flood-displaced people prolonged conflict by causing a lack of access to services for some of the host population and feelings of grievance. Further, migration from drought-stricken areas to local urban centres has been used to suggest a climate trigger for the Syrian conflict (e.g., Ash and Obradovich (2020)). However, this link has been strongly contested by research that contextualises the drought in wider political economic approaches and existing migration patterns (De Châtel, 2014; Fröhlich, 2016; Selby, 2019; 16.2.3.9)."

Petrova (2021) found that while migration in general was associated with increased protests in urban receiving areas, the relationship did not hold for hazard-related migration. In other settings, the association of civil unrest with in-migration was found to depend on the political alignment of the host state with the capital (Bhavnani and Lacina, 2015), previous experience of extreme climate hazards (Koubi et al., 2021) and previous experience of violence among migrants (Linke et al., 2018). Climate-related migrants have reported higher levels of perception and experience of violence in their destination (Linke et al., 2018; Koubi et al., 2018). There has been no association established between international migration and conflict.

For example, conflict deepens gendered vulnerabilities to climate change related to unequal access to land and livelihood opportunities (Chandra et al., 2017). Motivations for inter-group violence may be influenced by constructions of masculinity, for example the responsibility to secure their family’s survival or pay dowries (Myrttinen et al., 2017), and gendered roles may incentivise young men to protest or to join non-state armed groups during periods of adverse climate (Myrttinen et al., 2015; Myrttinen et al., 2017; Anwar et al., 2019; Hendrix and Haggard, 2015; Koren and Bagozzi, 2017).

For example, early marriage is used as a coping strategy for managing the effects of extreme weather events (Ahmed et al., 2019) and women are exposed to increase risk of harassment and sexual assault as scarcity and gender-based roles cause them to walk longer distances to fetch water and fuel (Le Masson et al., 2019). Within the household, violent backlash or heightened tensions may arise from changing gender norms as men migrate to find work in post-disaster settings (Stork et al., 2015) and men’s use of negative coping mechanisms, such as alcoholism, when unable to meet norms of providing for the household (Anwar et al., 2019; Stork et al., 2015).

Conflict may arise when there is resistance to a proposed project, where interventions favour one group over another, or when projects undermine livelihoods or displace populations (e.g., Nightingale (2017); Sovacool et al.

Research assessed in AR5 focused on the potential for resource wars and Arctic land grabs.

The first focused on cause-specific mortality for eight exposures for 2030 and 2050 for a mid-range emissions scenario (A1b) and three scenarios of economic growth (WHO, 2014). The study estimated that the climate change projected to occur by 2050 (compared to 1961–1990) could result in an excess of approximately 250,000 deaths yr –1, dominated by increases in deaths due to heat (94,000, mainly in Asia and high-income countries), childhood undernutrition (85,000, mainly in Africa but also in Asia), malaria (33,000, mainly in Africa) and diarrhoeal disease (33,000, mainly in Africa and Asia). Overall, more than half of this excess mortality is projected for Africa. Near-term projections (for 2030) are predominantly for childhood undernutrition (95,200 out of 241,000 total excess deaths) (Figure 7.8). The second study (Carleton et al. 2020) focused on all-cause mortality associated with warming under both a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) and a middle emissions scenario (RCP4.5). The analyses created a metric of death equivalents that accounted for hot and cold temperature-related mortality and the costs of individual level adaptation; no acclimatization or community-level adaptation, such as early warning systems, were incorporated. Average annual temperature-mortality-income per capita relationships estimated from pooled data from 40 predominantly middle- and high-income countries (38% of the world population) were applied worldwide. Under the high emissions scenario, climate change was projected to result in approximately 85 deaths equivalents per 100,000 population."

As shown in Figure 7.9, these adaptation scenarios significantly alter the warming thresholds at which risks accelerate, with the proactive adaptation scenario, a scenario that emphasises international cooperation towards achieving sustainable development, having the greatest potential to avoid significant increases in risks under all but the highest levels of warming. The incomplete adaptation scenario describes a world with moderate challenges to adaptation and mitigation. The limited adaptation scenario describes a world with high challenges to adaptation and mitigation. In the figure, transitions are based on the peer-reviewed literature projecting risks for each of the health outcomes.

Since AR5 there has been considerable progress with quantifying future human exposure to extreme heat (Schwingshackl et al., 2021), especially as determined by different combinations of SSPs and RCPs (Chambers, 2020; Cheng et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; Ma and Yuan, 2021; Russo et al., 2019). For example, Table 7.1 shows projections of population exposure to heatwaves, as expressed by the number of person-days, for the 2061–2080 period aggregated by geographical region and SSP/RCP. At the global level, projected future exposure increases from approximately 15 million person-days for the current period to 535 billion person-days for high population growth under the high GHG emission SSP3-RCP8.5 scenario, while for the low population growth/high urbanisation and business as usual SSP5-RCP4.5 scenario, the exposure is substantially lower at 170 billion person-days. Spatial variations in future heatwave frequency and population growth play out in the form of significant geographical contrasts in exposure, with the largest increases projected for low latitude regions such as India and significant portions of sub-Saharan Africa, where increases in heatwave frequency and population are expected. Over East Asia and especially eastern China, exposures are projected to rise, with the effect of increases in heatwave frequency exceeding the countering effect of projected reductions in population, especially in non-urban areas. Further, for North America and Europe, where rural depopulation is projected, the predominant driver of increases in exposure is urban growth (Jones et al., 2018)."

One global level assessment for a 1.5°C warming projects that low human development index countries will experience exposure levels equal to or greater than the exposure levels for very high human development index countries under a 2°C warming (Russo, 2019). The same assessment also finds that holding global warming below 1.5°C in tandem with achieving sustainable socioeconomic development (e.g., SSP1 as opposed to SSP4) yields reduced levels of heatwave exposure, especially for low human development index countries, particularly across sub-Saharan Africa. Similar findings were found in other global level assessments. Global exposure to extreme heat increases almost 30 times under a SSP3-8.5 combination, with the average exposure for Africa 118 times greater than historical levels, in stark contrast to the four-fold increase projected for Europe. Compared to a SSP3-8.5 scenario, exposure was reduced by 65% and 85% under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios, respectively (Liu et al., 2017)."

The latter is particularly important as studies that address UHI–heatwave interactions have mainly focused on changes in UHI intensity (e.g., Ramamurthy and Bou-Zeid (2017); Scott et al. (2018)). Whether significant urban mortality anomalies arise from the interplay of heatwaves and UHIs largely remains an open question although at least one study demonstrated higher urban compared to rural mortality rates during heatwaves (Ruuhela et al., 2021).

The projected effect of climate change varies markedly by region, with projections for west Africa tending to indicate a shortening of transmission seasons and neutral or small net reductions in overall risk, whereas studies consistently project increases in southern and eastern Africa, with potentially an additional 76 million people at risk of endemic exposure (10–12 months yr –1) by the 2080s (Nkumama et al., 2017; Ryan et al., 2015b; Semakula et al., 2017; Zaitchik, 2019; Leedale et al., 2016; Murdock et al., 2016; Yamana et al., 2016; Ryan et al., 2020). In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria case incidence associated with dams in malaria-endemic regions will likely  be exacerbated by climate change, with significantly higher rates projected under RCP8.5 in comparison to lower-emission scenarios (Kibret et al., 2016). Incidence of malaria in Madagascar is projected to increase under RCP4.5 through RCP8.5 (Rakotoarison et al., 2018). Distribution of P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria in China is likely  to increase under RCPs higher than 2.6, especially RCP8.5 (Hundessa et al., 2018). In India, projected scenarios for the 2030s under RCP4.5 indicate changes in the spatial distribution of malaria, with new foci and potential outbreaks in the Himalayan region, southern and eastern states, and an overall increase in months suitable for transmission overall, with some other areas experiencing a reduction in transmission months (Sarkar et al., 2019)."

In Africa, shifting temperature regimes associated with climate change are expected to lead to reduced snail populations in areas with already high temperatures and higher populations in areas with currently low winter temperatures (Kalinda et al., 2017; McCreesh and Booth, 2014). Infection risk with Schistosoma mansoni may increase by up to 20% over most of eastern Africa over the next 20–50 years but decrease by more than 50% in parts of north and east Kenya, southern South Sudan and eastern People’s Democratic Republic of Congo (PDRC) (McCreesh et al., 2015), with a possible overall net contraction (Stensgaard et al., 2013). In China, currently endemic areas in Sichuan Province may become unsuitable for snail habitats, but currently non-endemic areas in Sichuan and Hunan/Hubei provinces may see a new emergence (Yang and Bergquist, 2018).

WHO Quantitative Risk Assessments for the effects of climate change on selected causes of death for the 2030s and 2050s project that overall deaths from diarrhoea should fall due to socioeconomic development but that the effect of climate change under higher emission scenarios could cause an additional 48,000 deaths in children aged under 15 years in 2030 and 33,000 deaths for 2050, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. In Ecuador, projected increases in rainfall variability and heavy rainfall events may increase diarrhoea burden in urban regions (Deshpande et al., 2020).

Recent data suggest a poleward expansion of Vibrios to areas with no previous incidence, particularly in mid- to high-latitude regions in areas where rapid warming is taking place (Baker-Austin et al., 2017). The number of Vibrio-induced diarrhoea cases yr –1 increased in past decades in the Baltic Sea region, and the projected risk of vibriosis will increase in northern areas, where waters are expected to become warmer and more saline due to reduced precipitation and have higher chlorophyll concentrations (Escobar et al., 2015; Semenza et al., 2017)."

Accelerated releases of dissolved organic matter to inland and coastal waters through increases in precipitation are expected to reduce the potential for solar ultraviolet inactivation of pathogens and increase risks for associated WBDs (Williamson et al., 2017). The combined relative risk for waterborne campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and diseases due to Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli was estimated to be 1.1 (i.e., a 10% increase) for every 1°C in mean annual temperature, while by the 2080s, under RCP8.5, annual rates of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis could rise by approximately 16% due to more severe precipitation events (Brubacher et al., 2020; Chhetri et al., 2019)."

wg2_ch07_7.3.1.6_p2,NO_TITLE,"Poor air quality contributes to a range of NCDs, including cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological, commonly resulting in hospitalisation or death. This section considers the possible risks for health of future climate-related changes in ozone and PM. The climate penalty, the degree to which global warming could affect future air quality, is better understood for ozone than for PM (von Schneidemesser et al., 2020). This is because increases in air temperature enhance ozone formation via associated photochemical processes (Archibald et al., 2020; Fu and Tian, 2019). The association between climate and PM is complex and moderated by a diverse range of PM components as well as formation and removal mechanisms (von Schneidemesser et al., 2020), added to which is uncertainty about future climate-related PM sources such as wildfires (Ford et al., 2018) and changes in aridity (Achakulwisut et al., 2019). As noted in AR6 WGI Chapter 6 (Naik et al 2021), future air quality will largely depend on precursor emissions, with climate change projected to have mixed effects. Because of the uncertainty in how natural processes will respond, there is low confidence in the projections of surface ozone and PM under climate change (Naik et al., 2021). This has implications on the levels of confidence in the projections of the health climate penalty associated with climate-induced changes in air quality (Orru et al., 2017; Orru et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.3.1.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"There is a rich literature on global and regional level projections of air quality-related health effects arising from changes in emissions. Comparatively few studies assess how changes in air pollution directly attributable to climate change are likely  to affect future mortality levels. Projections indicate that emission reduction scenarios consistent with stabilisation of global temperature change at 2°C or below would yield substantial co-benefits for air quality-related health outcomes (Chowdhury et al., 2018b; von Schneidemesser et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2016c; Markandya et al., 2018; Orru et al., 2019; Shindell et al., 2018) (high confidence). For example, by 2030, compared to 2000, it was estimated that globally and annually 289,000 PM2.5-related premature deaths could have been avoided under RCP4.5 compared to 17,200 PM2.5-related excess premature deaths under RCP8.5 (Silva et al., 2016c). Further, and notwithstanding estimated reductions in global PM2.5 levels and an associated increase in the number of avoidable deaths, the benefits of following a low emissions pathway are expected to be apparent by 2100, with avoidable deaths estimated at 2.39 million deaths yr –1 under RCP4.5. This contrasts with the 1.31 million deaths estimated under RCP8.5. A few projections of the health-related climate penalty indicate a possible increase in ozone and PM2.5-associated mortality under RCP8.5 (Doherty et al., 2017; Orru et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.3.1.6_p4,NO_TITLE,"At the global level for PM2.5, annual premature deaths due to climate change were projected to be 55,600 (−34,300 to 164,000) and 215,000 (−76,100 to 595,000) in 2030 and 2100, respectively, countering by 16% the projected decline in PM2.5-related mortality between 2000 and 2100 without climate change (Silva et al., 2017). Similarly for ozone, the number of annual premature ozone-related deaths due to climate change was projected to be 3,340 in 2030 and 43,600 in 2050, with climate change accounting for 1.2% (14%) of the annual premature deaths in 2030 (2100) (Silva et al., 2017). These global level projections average over considerable geographical variations (Silva et al., 2017). Projections of the climate change effect on ozone mortality in 2100 were greatest for East Asia (41 deaths yr –1 per million people), India (8 deaths yr –1 per million people) and North America (13 deaths yr –1 per million people). For PM2.5, mortality was projected to increase across all regions except Africa (−25,200 deaths yr –1 per million people) by 2100, with estimated increases greatest for India (40 deaths yr –1 per million people), the Middle East (45 deaths yr –1 per million people), East Asia (43 deaths yr –1 per million people) and the Former Soviet Union (57 deaths yr –1 per million people). Overall, higher ozone-related health burdens were projected to occur in highly populated regions, and greater PM2.5 health burdens were projected in high PM emission regions (Doherty et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.3.1.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"For central and southern Europe, climate change alone could result in an 11% increase in ozone-associated mortality by 2050. However, projected declines in ozone precursor emissions could reduce the EU-wide climate change effect on ozone-related mortality by up to 30%; the reduction was projected to be approximately 24% if aging and an increasingly susceptible population were accounted for in projections to 2050 (Orru et al., 2019). For the USA in 2069, the impact of climate change alone on annual PM2.5- and ozone-related deaths was estimated to be 13,000 and 3,000 deaths, respectively, with heat-driven adaptation of air conditioning accounting for 645 and 315 of the PM2.5- and ozone-related annual excess deaths, respectively (Abel et al., 2018). An aging population is a determinant of future air quality-related mortality levels. An aging population along with an increase in the number of vulnerable people may work to offset the decrease in deaths associated with a low emission pathway (RCP4.5) and possibly dominate the net increase in deaths under a business as usual pathway (RCP8.5) (Chen et al., 2020; Doherty et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2019; Schucht et al., 2015)."

However, the health consequences of a possible additive effect of air pollutants during heatwave events were heterogeneous, varying by location and moderated by socioeconomic factors at the intra-urban scale (Analitis et al., 2014; Fenech et al., 2019; Krug et al., 2020; Pascal et al., 2021; Schwarz et al., 2021; Scortichini et al., 2018). This, combined with the challenges associated with projecting future concentrations of health-relevant pollutants during heatwave events (Jahn and Hertig, 2021; Meehl et al., 2018), makes it difficult to say with any certainty that synergistic effects of heat and poor air quality will result in a heatwave–air pollution health penalty under climate change."

The incidence of pollen allergy and associated allergic disease increases with pollen exposure, and the timing of the pollen season and pollen concentrations are expected to change under climate change (Beggs, 2021; Ziska et al., 2019; Ziska, 2020). The overall length of the pollen season and total seasonal pollen counts/concentrations for allergenic species such as birch (Betula) and ragweed (Ambrosia) are expected to increase as a result of CO2 fertilisation and warming, leading to greater sensitisation (Hamaoui-Laguel et al., 2015; Lake et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2013). Changes in pollen levels for several species of trees and grasses are projected to increase annual emergency department visits in the USA by between 8% for RCP4.5 and 14% for RCP8.5 by the year 2090 (Neumann et al., 2019) with the exposure to some pollen types estimated to double beyond present levels in Europe by 2041–2060 (Lake et al., 2017). The prospect of increases in summer thunderstorm events under climate change (Brooks, 2013) may hold implications for changes in the occurrence of epidemic thunderstorm asthma (Bannister et al., 2021; Emmerson et al., 2021; Price et al., 2021).

Projections of temperature-related mortality from CVD for Beijing in the 2080s vary depending on RCP and population assumptions (Zhang et al., 2018a). Projections for Ningo, China, suggest heat-related years of life lost (YLL) could increase significantly in the month of August by between 3 and 11.5 times over current baselines by the 2070s, even with adaptation (Huang and et al., 2018). Yang and colleagues project that heat-related excess CVD mortality in China could increase to approximately 6% (from a 2010 baseline of under 2%) by the end of the century under RCP8.5 and to over 3% under RCP4.5 (Yang et al., 2021). The future burden of temperature-related myocardial infarctions in Germany is projected to rise under high emissions scenarios (Chen et al., 2019), while in the eastern USA, Limaye et al.

Because the relationships between temperature and CVD deaths are influenced by both climatic and non-climatic factors (such as population fitness and aging), future projections are highly sensitive to assumptions about interactions between climate, population characteristics and adaptation pathways. Changes in air quality because of climate change are an additional important factor. For example, an assessment of future annual and seasonal excess mortality from short-term exposure to higher levels of ambient ozone in Chinese cities under RCP8.5 projected approximately 1,500 excess annual CVD deaths in 2050 (Chen et al., 2018). To the extent possible, the relationships reported above reflect changes derived from changes in heat exposure driven by climate change and not changes in population demographics or air pollution exposure."

Climate change limits the potential for healthy diets through adverse impacts on natural and human systems that are disproportionately experienced by low-income countries and communities (FAO et al., 2021). Climate-driven droughts, floods, storms, wildfires and extreme temperatures reduce food production potential by diminishing soil health, water security and biological and genetic diversity (Macdiarmid and Whybrow, 2019).

Climate change may affect labour capacity, because heat can compromise the ability to engage in manual labour as well as cognitive functioning, with impacts on the economic status of individual households as well as societies (Kjellstrom et al., 2016; Liu, 2020). Migrations and displacement caused by climate change may worsen the well-being of those affected (Vins et al., 2015; Missirian and Schlenker, 2017). Climate change is expected to increase aggression through both direct and indirect mechanisms, with one study predicting a 6% increase in homicides globally for a 1°C temperature increase, although noting significant variability across countries (Mares and Moffett, 2016). Broad societal outcomes such as economic unrest, political conflict or governmental dysfunction assessed in Section 7.3.5 may undermine the mental health of populations in the future (medium confidence). Food insecurity presents its own severe risks for mental health and cognitive function (Jones, 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.3.2_p1,7.3.2.1 Region-Specific Changes in Climatic Risks ,"Future changes in climate-related migration and displacement are expected to vary by region and over time according to: (a) region-specific changes in climatic drivers, (b) changes in the future adaptive capacity of exposed populations, (c) population growth in areas most exposed to climatic risks and (d) future changes in mediating factors such as international development and migration policies (high agreement, medium evidence) (Gemenne and Blocher, 2017; Cattaneo et al., 2019; McLeman, 2019). This section assesses future risks associated with changes in the frequency and/or severity of storms, floods, droughts, extreme heat, wildfires and other events assessed in Section 7.2 that currently affect migration and displacement patterns, as well as the impacts of emerging hazards, including average temperature increases that may affect the habitability of settlements in arid regions and the tropics, and sea level rise and associated hazards that threaten low-lying coastal settlements. Studies assessed here consider projected changes in future exposure to hazards over a variety of geographical and temporal periods, with some considering changes in population numbers in exposed areas. The uneven distribution of exposure of age cohorts is typically overlooked in existing research. For example, people younger than age 10 in the year 2020 are projected to experience a nearly four-fold increase in extreme events under 1.5°C of global warming and a five-fold increase under 3°C warming; such increases in exposure would not be experienced by a person of the age of 55 in 2020 in their remaining lifetime under any warming scenario (Thiery et al., 2021)."

Projections of the number of people at risk of future displacement by sea level rise range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions by the end of this century, depending on (a) the sea level rise scenario or RCP selected, (b) projections of future population growth in exposed areas and (c) the criteria used for identifying exposure. These latter measures can include estimates of populations situated within selected elevations above sea level (with 1 m, 2 m and 10 m being common parameters), populations situated in 1-in-100 year floodplains or populations in areas likely  to be entirely inundated under specific RCPs (Neumann et al., 2015; Hauer et al., 2016; Merkens et al., 2018; McMichael et al., 2020; Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021). As an illustrative example, an estimated 267 million people (error range = 197–347 million at 68% confidence level) worldwide lived within 2 m of sea level in 2020, 59% of whom reside in tropical regions of Asia (Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021). At a 1 m increase in sea level and holding coastal population numbers constant, the number of people worldwide living within 2 m of sea level expands to 410 million (error range = 341–473 million). However, it is unlikely  that coastal population growth rates will remain constant at global or regional scales in future decades. At present, coastal cities in many regions have relatively high rates of population growth due to the combined effects of in-migration from other regions and natural increase, with coastal areas of Africa having the highest projected future population growth rates (Neumann et al., 2015; Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021; Box 7.5). Further complicating future estimates is that many large coastal cities are situated in deltas with high rates of subsidence, meaning that locally experienced changes in relative sea level may be much greater than sea level rise attributable to climate change, thereby further increasing the number of people exposed (Edmonds et al., 2020; Nicholls et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch07_7.3.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Sea level rise is not presently a significant driver of migration in comparison with hazards assessed in Section 7.2.6, but it has been attributed as a factor necessitating the near-term resettlement of small coastal settlements in Alaska, Louisiana, Fiji, Tuvalu and the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea (Marino and Lazrus, 2015; Connell, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2016; Nichols, 2019). In coastal Louisiana, communities tend to resist leaving exposed settlements until approximately 50% of available land has been lost (Hauer et al., 2019). Movements away from highly exposed areas may have longer-term demographic implications for inland settlements (Hauer, 2017), but this requires further study. Based on the available empirical evidence, sea level rise does not appear to currently be a primary motivation for international migration originating in small island states in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; rather, economic considerations and family reunification appear to be the dominant drivers (McCubbin et al., 2015; Stojanov and Du, 2016; Heslin, 2019; Kelman et al., 2019). However, climatic drivers of migration are anticipated to take on a much greater causal role in migration decisions in coming decades (Thomas et al., 2020) and may discourage return migration to small island states (van der Geest et al., 2020). Even under best-case sustainable development scenarios, rising sea levels and associated hazards create risks of involuntary displacement in low-lying coastal areas and should be expected to generate a need for organised relocation of populations where protective infrastructure cannot be constructed (Horton and de Sherbinin, 2021; Hamilton et al., 2016). In high emissions scenarios, low-lying island states may face the long-term risk of becoming uninhabitable, creating the potential for a new phenomenon of climate-induced statelessness (Piguet, 2019; Desai et al., 2021)."

Greater research into the specific dynamics between extreme heat and population movements is required in order to make an accurate assessment of this risk. Recent studies suggest that future increases in average temperatures could expose populations across wide areas of the tropics and subtropics to ambient temperatures for extended periods each year that are beyond the threshold for human habitability (Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Im et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2020). This effect would be amplified in urban settings where heat-island effects occur and create a heightened need for air conditioning and other adaptation measures. In addition to risks associated with average temperature changes, Dosio et al. (2018) project that at 1.5°C warming, between 9% and 18% of the global population will be regularly exposed to extreme heat events at least once in five years, with the exposure rate nearly tripling with 2°C warming. How these changes in exposure to high temperatures will affect future migration patterns, particularly among vulnerable groups, will depend heavily on future adaptation responses (Horton and de Sherbinin, 2021). Multiple country-level studies assessed in Section 7.2 observe existing associations between extreme heat, its impacts on agricultural livelihoods and changes in rural-to-urban migration flows in parts of south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. A study conducted in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines suggests that an increased risk of heat stress would likely  influence migration intentions of significant numbers of people (Zander et al., 2019)."

The most reliable example of such studies to date is a World Bank report by Rigaud et al. (2018) that generated projections of future internal population displacements in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America by 2050 using multiple climate and development scenarios, resulting in a very large range of possible outcomes (from 31 to 143 million people being displaced, depending on assumptions). An important outcome is the study’s emphasis on how the potential for future migration and displacement will be strongly mediated by socioeconomic development pathways in low- and middle-income countries. Hoffmann et al.

One challenge concerns global and regional variability of baseline data for current populations, which is typically aggregated from national censuses that vary considerably in terms of frequency, timing and reliability, especially in low-income countries. A number of gridded mapping dataset initiatives emerged in recent years to support population–environment modelling research at global and regional levels, common ones being the Gridded Population of the World, the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project, and LandScan Global Population dataset (McMichael et al., 2020). For future population projections at national levels, researchers commonly draw upon data generated by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which publishes periodic projections for future fertility, mortality, and international migration rates for over 200 countries, the most recent projections being for the 2020 to 2100 period (UN DESA Population Division, 2019). There have been debates among demographers regarding the precision of DESA projections, and whether these overestimate or underestimate future population growth in some regions (Ezeh et al., 2020). Population growth rates are highly influenced by socioeconomic conditions, meaning that future population levels at local, national and regional scales are likely  to respond to relative rates of progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (Abel et al., 2016). The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in climate impacts and adaptation research include a variety of assumptions about future mortality, fertility and migration rates and provide a range of population growth scenarios that diverge after the year 2030 according to future development trajectories (Samir and Lutz, 2017) and are then further modified and downscaled by researchers for national-level studies. Understanding future risks of climate change will benefit from continued efforts by the international community to collect and share data on observed population numbers and trends, and to work towards better projected data for population characteristics that strongly influence vulnerability to climate risks, such as gender, age and indigeneity."

Risks are amplified by insecure land tenure, competing land uses and weather-sensitive economic activities when they occur in the context of weak institutions and poor governance, poverty and inequality (Section 7.2.7). These known, climate-sensitive risk factors allow projections of where conflict is more likely to arise or worsen under climate change impacts (see Chapters 1, 4, 5, 6 and 16) (Mach et al., 2020).

Burke et al. (2015b) concluded that with each one standard deviation increase in temperature, inter-personal conflict increased by 2.4% and inter-group conflict by 11.3%. However, the statistical methods have been criticised for under-representing the known role that socioeconomic conditions and conflict history play in determining the prevalence of violence (Buhaug et al., 2014; van Weezel, 2019; Abel et al., 2019). Forecasting armed conflict is used as a heuristic policy tool rather than a representation of the future (Cederman and Weidmann, 2017) and forecasts have limitations. For example, what constitutes and is experienced as hazards and as drivers of conflict will shift over time as societies adapt to climate change (Roche et al., 2020). The SSPs assume economic convergence between countries and do not reflect growth disruptions (e.g., commodity price shocks) that are often a key conflict risk factor (Dellink et al., 2017; Buhaug and Vestby, 2019 ; Hegre et al., 2021)."

Associations between environmental factors and conflict are weak in comparison to socioeconomic and political drivers. Therefore, meeting the SDGs, including Goal 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions represent unambiguous pathways to reducing conflict risk under climate change (Singh and Chudasama, 2021). Actively pursuing peace rather than taking conflict for granted (Barnett, 2019), improving focus on gender within peacebuilding (Dunn and Matthew, 2015; UNEP, 2021) and understanding how natural resources and their governance interact with peacebuilding (Krampe et al., 2021) present key elements of CRDPs for sustainable peace."

Transformational resilience would need parallel investments in social and health protections, including achieving the SDGs, coupled with investments in mitigation (Ebi and Hess, 2020). Further, investments in mitigating GHG emissions will not only reduce risks associated with dangerous climate change but will improve population health and well-being through several salutary pathways."

Given the wide range of causal pathways through which climate change affects environmental and social systems resulting in health impacts, a systems-based approach can promote identifying, implementing and evaluating solutions that support population health and health systems in the short and longer term (high agreement, medium evidence).  Such an approach provides insights into policies and programmes that promote health and well-being via multiple sectors (e.g., water and food safety and security) and can ensure that health policies do not have adverse consequences in other sectors (WHO, 2015b; Ebi and Otmani del Barrio, 2017; Wright et al., 2021). "
wg2_ch07_7.4.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Figure 7.11 illustrates the context within which risks to health outcomes and health systems emerge because of climate change. The figure presents the emergence of risk from interactions between specific types of climatic hazards, the exposure and vulnerability to those hazards, and the responses taken within the health sector. The figure also illustrates how health risks are situated within larger interactions between the health system and other sectors and systems, with underlying enabling conditions making adaptation and transformation possible. Within this context, response options can decrease the impacts of climate change on human health, well-being and health systems by (a) reducing exposure to climate-related hazards; (b) reducing vulnerability to such hazards and (c) strengthening health system responses to future risks. Such approaches are described as ‘Lateral Public Health’ and emphasise the importance of involving community members and stakeholders in the planning and coordination of activities (Semenza, 2021; Semenza, 2011). Lateral public health strives for community engagement (e.g., through access to technology in decision-making, such as low-cost air sensors for wildfire smoke) in preparedness and response."
wg2_ch07_7.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Effective health risk management incorporates the magnitude and pattern of future climate risks as well as potential changes in factors that determine vulnerability and exposure to climate hazards, such as determinants of healthcare access, demographic shifts, urbanisation patterns and changes in ecosystems (very high confidence). Climate change is associated with shocks and stresses that can affect the capacity and resilience of health systems and healthcare facilities (WHO, 2020a). Figure 7.12 illustrates some possible extents to which the capacity of health systems could be reduced when exposed to a stress or shock, and possible pathways forward, from collapse to transformation. The subsequent sections of this chapter assess adaptation and mitigation options to facilitate building the resilience of health systems and healthcare facilities to recover better than before or to transform."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Analysis of the NDCs to the Paris Agreement to determine how health was incorporated, including impacts, adaptation and co-benefits, concluded that most low- and middle-income countries referred to health in their NDC (Dasandi et al., 2021). Figure 7.13 shows the degree of health engagement; this engagement is based on indicators measuring the specificity and detail of health references within a country’s NDC. Many vulnerable countries had high engagement of the health sector in the country NDC. However, this analysis did not determine whether the ambition expressed was sufficient to address the health adaptation needs."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"The 2018 WHO Health and Climate Change Survey, a voluntary national survey sent to all 194 WHO member states, to which 101 responded, found that national planning on health and climate change is advancing, but the comprehensiveness of strategies and plans need to be strengthened. Implementing action on key health and climate change priorities remains challenging and multi-sectoral collaboration on health and climate change policy is evident, with uneven progress (Watts et al., 2021). Approximately 50% of respondent countries had developed national health and climate strategies, with over two-thirds doing so within the preceding five years, and 48 of 101 countries had conducted a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment (Watts et al., 2019). However, most countries reported only moderate or low levels of implementation, with financing cited as the most common barrier due to a lack of information on opportunities, in turn linked to a lack of connection by health actors to climate change policy processes and a lack of capacity to participate in national planning. A review of public health systems in 34 countries found that only slightly more than half considered climate change impacts and adaptation needs (Berry et al., 2018). Because the health risks of climate change often vary within a country, sub-national assessments and plans are needed to help local authorities protect and promote population health in a changing climate (Aracena et al., 2021; Basel et al., 2020; Schramm et al., 2020a)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Health policies were historically not designed or implemented taking into consideration the risks of climate change and as currently structured are likely insufficient to manage the changing health burdens in coming decades (very high confidence). The magnitude and pattern of future health burdens attributable to climate change, at least until mid-century, will be determined primarily by adaptation and development choices. Current and future emissions will play an increasing role in determining attributable burdens after mid-century. Increased investment in strengthening general health systems, along with targeted investments to enhance protection against specific climate-sensitive exposures (e.g., hazard early warning and response systems and integrated vector control programmes for VBDs) will increase resilience if implemented to at least keep pace with climate change (high confidence). Investments to address the social determinants of health can reduce inequities and increase resilience (high confidence)  (Thornton et al., 2016; Marmot et al., 2020; Wallace et al., 2015; Semenza and Paz, 2021)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Peer-reviewed publications of health adaptation to climate change in low- and middle-income countries have typically focused on flooding, rainfall, drought and extreme heat through improving community resilience, DRR and policy, governance and finance (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021; Scheelbeek et al., 2021). Health outcomes of successful adaptation have included reductions in infectious disease incidence, improved access to water and sanitation and improved food security. Figure 7.14 shows a Sankey diagram of climate hazards, adaptation responses and health outcomes. The figure highlights the range of health adaptation responses that are discussed in more detail earlier in this chapter and demonstrates the potential health benefit of adaptation efforts that affect a broad range of health determinants."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Questions of the feasibility and effectiveness of health adaptation options differ from those in other sectors because public health is a societal enterprise that cuts across many different spheres of society. Consequently, there are dependencies that lie outside the jurisdiction of the health sector. All the health risks of a changing climate currently cause adverse outcomes, with policies and programmes implemented in at least some health programmes in some places. Policies and programmes are continuously modified to increase effectiveness; this will need to accelerate in a changing climate. Improvements are needed as more is understood about disease aetiology, changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions, obstacles to uptake and other factors."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Policies and programmes for climate-sensitive health outcomes are only beginning to incorporate the challenges and opportunities of climate change, although this is critical for increasing resilience. The fundamentals of many policies and programmes in a changing climate will remain the same: implementing infectious disease control programmes, preventing heat-related mortality and morbidity and reducing the burden of other climate-related health endpoints, but activities will need to explicitly account for climate change to continue to protect health. Even with such attention to climate change, there are limits to the feasibility and effectiveness of health adaptation options for extreme heat, controlling emerging infectious diseases and controlling cascading risk pathways."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"As discussed in Sections 1.4.2 and 1.5, an adaptation option is feasible when it is capable of being implemented by one or more relevant actors. In the health sector, WHO, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other organisations provide technical expertise to ministries of health, who then provide national to local healthcare and public health services. Generally, the question is less of overall feasibility, given the range of potential adaptation options that have yet to be fully explored and implemented, but more of readiness to buy into the adaptation efforts required from health and other sectors. In specific contexts, feasibility also depends on governance capacity, financial capacity, public opinion and the distribution of political and economic power (Chapter 17). In other words, adaptation to climate change is broadly feasible with adequate investment and engagement, although this has yet to materialise, and in specific contexts feasibility is contingent and time-varying, and needs to be assessed at national to sub-national scales. For example, a scoping review in the Pacific region noted the following areas where further and significant investment and support are needed to increase feasibility of climate and health action: (a) health workforce capacity development, (b) enhanced surveillance and monitoring systems and (c) research to address priorities and their subsequent translation into practice and policy (Bowen et al., 2021). Vulnerability, adaptation and capacity assessments include consideration of the feasibility and effectiveness of priority health adaptation options and can help decision makers identify strategies for enhancing adaptation feasibility in specific contexts."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Integrated vector control approaches are crucial to effectively manage the geographic spread, distribution and transmission of VBDs associated with climate change (high confidence).  Some of the projected risks of climate change on VBDs can be offset through enhanced commitment to existing approaches to integrated case management and integrated vector control management (Cissé et al., 2018; Confalonieri et al., 2017; Semenza and Paz, 2021). Important components include enhanced disease surveillance and early warning and response systems that can identify potential outbreaks at sub-seasonal to decadal time scales (Rocklöv and Dubrow, 2020; Semenza and Zeller, 2014; Table 7.3). In many cases, the exposure dynamics of VBDs are strongly influenced by socioeconomic dynamics that should be considered when developing and deploying adaptation options (UNEP, 2018). This is especially the case in low-income countries. For example, insufficient access to sanitation and the presence of standing water are important determinants of the presence of Aedes aegypti populations and the pathogens that cause visceral leishmaniasis (L. donovani and L. infantum) in urban and peri-urban areas. Low housing quality and lack of refuse management are associated with higher rodent infestation. Strategies expected to have important health co-benefits include those that support health systems strengthening and ecosystem health, improve access to health coverage, increase awareness and education and address the underlying conditions of uneven development and a lack of adequate housing and access to water and sanitation systems in areas endemic to mosquito-borne diseases (Semenza and Paz, 2021; Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2)."

wg2_ch07_7.4.2.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation options for climate-related risks for WBDs and FBDs are strongly associated with wider, multi-sectoral initiatives to improve sustainable development in low-income communities (high confidence). Effective measures include improving access to potable water and reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events (Brubacher et al., 2020; Cisse, 2019; Table 7.3). This requires focusing on farm-level interventions that limit the spread of pathogens into adjacent waterways, preventing the ongoing contamination of water and sanitation systems and the promotion of food-safe human behaviours (Levy et al., 2018; Nichols et al., 2018). It is also important to implement well-targeted and integrated WASH interventions, including at schools and ensuring proper disposal of excreta and wastewater. Cities can integrate regional climate projections into their engineering models to produce lower-risk source waters and increase the resilience of water and sanitation technologies and management systems under a range of climate scenarios. Technologies can help abstract source waters from depth, introduce or increase secondary booster disinfection, design or modify systems to reduce residence times within pipes and/or coat exposed pipes (Levy et al., 2018). Other efficient interventions include source water protection, promoting water filtration, testing the presence of waterborne pathogens in shellfish, imposing trade restrictions where necessary and improving hygiene at all levels (Semenza and Paz, 2021). Needed actions include early warning and response systems, strengthening the resilience of communities and health systems and promoting ecosystem health, water safety plans and sanitation safety plans (Brubacher et al., 2020; Cisse, 2019; Ford and Hamner, 2018; Lake and Barker, 2018; Levy et al., 2018; Nichols et al., 2018; WHO and International Water Association, 2009; WHO, 2016a; WHO, 2018b; Semenza, 2021; Rocklöv et al., 2021)."

wg2_ch07_7.4.2.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"To date, air conditioning is the main adaptation approach for mitigating the health effects of high temperatures, especially in relation to cardiorespiratory health (Madureira et al., 2021). However, air conditioning may constitute a maladaptation because of its high demands on energy and associated heat emissions, especially in high-density cities (Eriksen et al., 2021; Magnan et al., 2016; Schipper, 2020), and also lead to ‘heat inequities’ as this is not an affordable or practical option for many (Jay et al., 2021; Turek-Hankins et al., 2021). HAPs link weather forecasts with alert and communication systems and response activities, including public cooling centres, enhanced heat-related disease surveillance and a range of individual actions designed to reduce the health effects of extreme heat events such as seeking shade and altering the pattern of work (McGregor et al., 2015). While well-designed and operationalisable HAPs possess the potential to reduce the likelihood of mortality from extreme heat events (medium confidence) (Benmarhnia et al., 2016; Heo et al., 2019b; Martinez-Solanas and Basagana, 2019; Martinez et al., 2019; De’Donato et al., 2018), full process and outcome-based evaluations of HAPs and their constituent components are lacking (Boeckmann and Rohn, 2014; Chiabai et al., 2018b; Boeckmann and Rohn, 2014; Nitschke et al., 2016; Diaz et al., 2019; Benmarhnia et al., 2016; Heo et al., 2019a; Heo et al., 2019b; Ragettli and Roosli, 2019). Evaluations of heatwave early warning systems as a component within HAPs show inconsistent results in terms of their impact on predicting mortality rates (Nitschke et al., 2016; Benmarhnia et al., 2016; Heo et al., 2019a; Heo et al., 2019b; Ragettli and Roosli, 2019; Martinez et al., 2019; De’Donato et al., 2018; Weinberger et al., 2018b), indicating climate-based heat warning systems, which use a range of heat stress metrics (Schwingshackl et al., 2021), are not sufficient as a stand-alone approach to heat risk management (high confidence). To support HAP and heat risk-related policy development, identification and mapping of heat vulnerability ‘hot spots’ within urban areas have been proposed (Chen et al., 2019; Hatvani-Kovacs et al., 2018)"
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"A multi-sectoral approach, including the engagement of a range of stakeholders will likely benefit the response to longer-term heat risks through the implementation of measures such as climate-sensitive urban design and planning that mitigates UHI effects (high confidence) (Ebi, 2019; Jay et al., 2021; Alexander et al., 2016; Levy, 2016; Masson et al., 2018; McEvoy, 2019; Pisello et al., 2018). In the shorter-term, potentially localised solutions can include awnings, louvers, directional reflective materials, altering roof albedo, mist sprays, evaporative materials, green roofs and building facades and cooling centres (Jay et al., 2021; Macintyre and Heaviside, 2019; Spentzou et al., 2021; Takebayashi, 2018). NbS to reduce heat that offer co-benefits for ecological systems include green and blue infrastructure (e.g., urban greening/forestry and the creation of water bodies) (Koc et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2019; Shooshtarian et al., 2018; Ulpiani, 2019; Zuvela-Aloise et al., 2016; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020). The implementation of climate-sensitive design and planning can be constrained by governance issues (Jim et al., 2018) and the benefits are not always evenly distributed among residents. Implementation of climate-sensitive design and NbS does, however, need to be carried out within the context of wider public health planning because water bodies and moist vegetated surfaces provide suitable habitats for a range of disease vectors (Nasir et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2016; Trewin et al., 2020). Solutions recommended for managing exposure to heat in outdoor workers include improved basic protection (including shade and planned rest breaks), heat-appropriate personal protective equipment, work scheduling for cooler times of the day, heat acclimation, improved aerobic fitness, access to sufficient cold drinking water and on-site cooling facilities and mechanisation of work (Morabito et al., 2021; Morris et al., 2020; Varghese et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020)."

Highly feasible options were those where no or very few barriers were reported. Moderately feasible were those where barriers existed but did not have a strong negative effect on the adaptation option (or evidence was mixed). Low feasibility options had multiple barriers reported that could block implementation.

For example, children from families participating in Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program experienced improved nutritional outcomes, partly due to better household food consumption patterns and reduced child labour (Porter and Goyal, 2016). School feeding programmes improve nutritional outcomes, especially among girls, by promoting education, and by reducing child pregnancy and fertility rates (Bukvic and Owen, 2017).

Such systems are fundamental for anticipating when a crisis might occur and setting priorities for interventions (Funk et al., 2019). Financial investments to develop early warning systems are cost-effective and reduce human suffering (Choularton and Krishnamurthy, 2019) (high confidence). For instance, during the 2017 drought-induced food crisis in Kenya, 500,000 fewer people required humanitarian assistance than would have been expected based on past experiences; this was largely due to timely and effective interventions triggered by the early warning (Funk et al., 2018)."

DRR, including disaster preparedness, management and response, is widely recognised as important for reducing health consequences of climate-related hazards and extreme weather events (Keim, 2008; Phalkey and Louis, 2016). A systematic review by Islam et al. (2020) identified multiple, ongoing challenges to integrating climate adaptation and DRR at global and national levels, including a lack of capacity among key actors and institutions, a lack of coordination and collaboration across scales of government and general lack of funding—challenges that are particularly relevant for the health sector. Global events, including climate-related extreme events and public health emergencies of international concern (for example, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19) have influenced the development of national public health preparedness and response systems and attracted significant investment over the last two decades (Khan et al., 2015; Murthy et al., 2017; Watson et al., 2017). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the International Health Regulations establish important global and regional goals for increasing health system resilience and reducing health impacts from biological hazards and extreme climate events (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2015; Maini et al., 2017; UNFCCC, 2017b; Wright et al., 2020). There are explicit links between the health aspect of the Sendai Framework and UN SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 17 (Wright et al., 2020). More specifically, reducing the number of disaster-related deaths, illnesses and injuries, as well as damage to health facilities are key indicators for achieving the goals set out in the Sendai Framework (UNFCCC, 2017b)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.2.9_p2,NO_TITLE,"The intersection of health and multi-sectoral DRR and management, generally described as health emergency and disaster risk management (health-EDRM), encompasses multi-sectoral approaches from epidemic preparedness and response including the capacities for implementing the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), health systems strengthening and health systems resilience (Lo Iacono et al., 2017; WHO 2019; Wright et al., 2020). Health-EDRM costs to governments are notably lower than the cost of inaction (Peters et al., 2019). Additional per capita costs in low-income countries have been estimated to range from USD 4.33 (capital) and USD 4.16 (annual recurrent costs), and in upper middle-income countries to an additional USD 1.35 in capital costs and USD 1.41 in extra annual recurrent costs (Peters et al., 2019). Adopting a health-EDRM approach supports the systematic integration of health and multi-sectoral EDRM to ensure a holistic approach to health risks and assists in the alignment of action in health security, climate change and sustainable development (Chan and Peijun, 2017; Dar et al., 2014; WHO, 2019; Wright et al., 2020)."

Potential coherent approaches to addressing climate change and disaster risks to health include: strengthening health systems; vulnerability and risk assessments that incorporate disaster and climate change risk; building resilience of health systems and health infrastructure; and climate-informed EWSs (Banwell et al., 2018; Phalkey and Louis, 2016). However, a review of DRR projects including climate change in south Asia found that the health sector was the least represented with only 2% of 371 projects relating to health (Mall et al., 2019), indicating a need to strengthen the incorporation of climate change in health-EDRM. Current tracking under the Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 shows that most countries (particularly low-income countries and lower middle-income countries) still lack robust systems for integrated risk monitoring and early warning (UNEP, 2018). The incorporation of DRR and management strategies into climate adaptation for health and health systems at local scales is particularly important, given that it is at local scales where health services are most often delivered and where knowledge of specific needs and challenges is often greatest (Amaratunga et al., 2018; Schramm et al., 2020a). Indigenous knowledge has been shown to be valuable in DRR, with particularly strong evidence existing for drought risk reduction in sub-Saharan Africa (Fummi et al., 2017; Muyambo et al., 2017; Dube and Munsaka, 2018; Macnight Ngwese et al., 2018). In the USA, DRR strategies that draw upon traditional knowledge and local expertise are being incorporated into climate adaptation planning for health in a number of indigenous communities under the ‘Climate-ready Tribes Initiative’ (Schramm et al., 2020b)."

MEL determines whether adaptation options achieved their goals and whether resources were used effectively and efficiently (Boyer et al., 2020). One of the challenges for MEL in the context of adaptation is that climate risks vary as a function of time, location, socioeconomic development, demographics and activities in other sectors (Ebi et al., 2018a). MEL indicators in the health sector need to account for factors related to governance, implementation and learning as well as for exposures, impacts and programmatic activities, all of which are context dependent and are often outside the health sector (Boyer et al., 2020; Ebi et al., 2018a; Fox et al., 2019)."

Indicators are best grouped by category of activity, that is, vulnerability, risk and exposure; impacts; and adaptation and resilience (Ebi et al., 2018a). As health adaptation expands, enhanced monitoring will be needed to ensure that scientific advances are translated into policy and practice. A promising initiative that emerged since the AR5 is the Lancet Countdown, which represents a global effort at tracking various indicators of exposures, impacts, adaptation activities, finance and media activity related to climate change and health (Watts et al., 2018a), although this effort is principally focused on monitoring and does not explicitly focus on evaluation adaptation efforts or learning from adaptation efforts."

Integration and collaboration include working laterally across national government departments and agencies, as well as vertically from national agencies to local governments and with the private sector, academia, NGOs and civil society. In this context, top-down policy design and implementation are complemented by bottom-up approaches that engage community actors in programme design and draw upon their local practices, perspectives, opinions and experiences. Opportunities exist to better integrate public health into climate change discourse and policymaking processes, and to strengthen public health partnerships and collaborations (Awuor et al., 2020).

National surveys conducted by WHO identified financial constraints as a major barrier to the implementation of health adaptation priorities (WHO, 2019b; Watts et al., 2021). Novel research drawing on global financial transaction data suggests that in 2019, global financial transactions with the potential to deliver adaptation in the health and healthcare sector reached USD 18.4 billion, driven by transactions in high- and upper middle-income countries, with investment in Africa, Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean mostly stagnant (Watts et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"There has been limited participation of the health sector in international climate financing mechanisms (Martinez and Berry, 2018). Of 149 projects listed in the Adaptation Fund database in October 2020, a large number were broad-based initiatives that may have considerable indirect benefits for health systems, such as enhanced disaster preparedness and food security, but none were explicitly aimed at strengthening health systems or had directed funds through ministries of health. A review of projects funded by the major multi-lateral climate funds showed that less than 1.5% of dispersed adaptation funding and less than 0.5% of overall funding have been allocated to projects aimed at protecting health (WHO, 2015a). A survey of national public health organisation representatives from a mix of low-, middle- and high-income countries found that a lack of political commitment, insufficient coordination across sectors and inadequate funding for public health-specific adaptation initiatives were common barriers to building climate resilience (Marcus and Hanna, 2020). Under-investment in climate-specific initiatives in health systems coincides with persistent under-investment in healthcare more generally, especially in low- and middle-income countries (Schaferhoff et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.3.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation financing does not often reach places where the climate-sensitivity of the health sector is greatest  (Weiler, 2019). Financial constraints in Africa are one of the key reasons for slow implementation of health adaptation measures (Nhamo and Muchuru, 2019). Strengthening health systems in vulnerable countries has the potential to reduce current and future economic costs related to environmental health risks, thus enabling reinvestment in the health system and sustainable development (WHO, 2020a; WHO, 2015a). Robust and comprehensive climate and health financing builds first on core health sector investments (WHO, 2015a). Other potential opportunities for resource mobilisation include health-specific funding mechanisms, climate change funding streams and investments from multi-sectoral actions and actions in health-determining sectors (WHO, 2015a). Incorporating climate change and health considerations into disaster reduction and management strategies could improve funding opportunities and increase potential funding streams (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2015). Reinforcing cross-sectoral governance mechanisms maximises health co-benefits and economic savings by allowing for multi-sectoral costs and benefits to be comprehensively considered in decision-making (Belesova et al., 2016; WHO, 2020a; WHO, 2015b). An additional financial need concerns health research, the existing funding for which does not match what is needed to support the implementation of the combined objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement (Green and Minchin, 2014; Ebi, 2016; Green et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.3.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptation decisions and responses to climate change can be influenced by perceptions of risks, which are shaped by individuals’ characteristics, knowledge and experience (medium agreement, medium evidence). Institutional and governmental responses are critical for adapting to climate-related risks in health and other sectors, but individual responses also are relevant, such as choosing to implement adaptation measures. Individual responses are in turn affected not only by capabilities but also by perceptions that climate change is real and requires a response (Ogunbode et al., 2019). Perceptions of climate risks are formed by experiences of changes in local weather and extreme weather events (Sattler et al., 2018; Sattler et al., 2020; van der Linden, 2015), observations of environmental changes (Hornsey et al., 2016), experiences of and knowledge about climate change impacts (Ngo et al., 2020; van der Linden, 2015) and individual characteristics such as values and worldviews (Poortinga et al., 2019) (high agreement, medium evidence). Risk perceptions include both logical assessments about the likelihood and severity of climate change impacts and affective feelings about those impacts. On average, affective measures of risk perception are more strongly associated with disaster preparation than cognitive measures (Bamberg et al., 2017; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.3.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"In addition to perceptions of risk, the likelihood that an individual will implement behavioural adaptations or support relevant public policy is affected by subjective assessments of the response options (Bamberg et al., 2017; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019; Akompab et al., 2013; Carman and Zint, 2020; Hornsey et al., 2016; Brenkert-Smith et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.3.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Efficacy beliefs, social norms and subjective resilience also affect adaptation behaviour (medium confidence), which has implications for communication about the need for climate adaptation. Efficacy beliefs represent the belief in one’s ability to carry out particular action(s) and the belief that the action(s) will have the desired outcome. Belief that one is personally able to complete a behaviour is moderately associated with engaging in disaster preparations (Navarro et al., 2021; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) and with adaptation intentions (Burnham and Ma, 2017). Collective efficacy, the belief that a group of people working together can achieve a desired outcome, is important for participating in community adaptation behaviours (Bandura, 1982; Chen, 2015; Thaker et al., 2015). Related to this is response efficacy, a belief that a behaviour will achieve its desired outcome, which is also moderately associated with engaging in disaster preparations (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). Collective efficacy can potentially be developed by strengthening communication networks and social ties within a community (Haas et al., 2021; Jugert et al., 2016). Norms describing the adaptation strategies of others in a community, particularly those with high social status, can either facilitate or inhibit individual adaptation decisions (Neef et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2021)."

Subjective resilience (Clare et al., 2017) can influence preferred responses to climate change via assessment of one’s ability to engage in specific response options. Identities can influence assessment of subjective resilience. Place attachment, having a strong emotional connection to a particular location, is weakly associated with disaster preparation (Brügger et al., 2015). In some cases, place attachment may inhibit adaptive responses, either by reducing perceptions of risk or by making people reluctant to leave an area that is threatened (De Dominicis et al., 2015; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019).

Evidence from refugee studies and general migration research indicates that higher agency migration, in which migrants have mobility options, allows migrants greater opportunities for integrating into labour markets at the destination, makes it easier to remit money home and generally creates conditions for potential benefits for migrant households and for sending and receiving communities (International Organization for Migration, 2019). Bilateral agreements that facilitate labour migration have been identified as being especially urgently needed for Pacific small island states (Weber, 2017)."
wg2_ch07_7.4.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Adaptive migration and the implied assumption that people can or should simply move out of harm’s way is not a substitute for investment in adaptive capacity-building (high agreement ) (Bettini and Gioli, 2016). Climate-related migration, and especially involuntary displacement, often occurs only after in situ adaptation options have been exhausted and/or where government actions are inadequate (Adger et al., 2015; Ocello et al., 2015; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). The threshold at which household adaptation transitions from in situ measures to migration is highly context specific and reflects the degree of exposure to specific climate risks, mobility options and the socioeconomic circumstances of the household and local community (McLeman, 2017; Adams and Kay, 2019; Semenza and Ebi, 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). A consistent theme in the research literature reviewed for all sections of this chapter is that proactive investments in health, social and physical infrastructure, including those not aimed specifically at climate risks, build societal adaptive capacity and household resilience. In turn, expanding the range of adaptation options available to households increases the likelihood that, when migration does occur, it does so under conditions of high agency that lead to greater chances of success. In communities where climate-related migration and/or relocation is occurring or may occur, policymaking and planning benefits from understanding the cultural, social and economic needs of exposed populations and helps in the identification of responses and policies that build resilience (Hino et al. 2017)"
wg2_ch07_7.4.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Adaptive climate-related migration is often closely related to wage-seeking labour migration (medium confidence). Due to the circumstances under which they move, climate-related migrants’ destinations, labour market choices and returns from migration may be more heavily constrained than those of other labour migrants (Jessoe et al., 2018; Wrathall and Suckall, 2016).Within low- and middle-income countries, rural–urban migrant networks are important channels for remittances that may help build socioeconomic resilience to climate hazards in sending areas (Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020), with higher levels of wage-seeking labour participation observed in climate-sensitive locales in south Asia (Maharjan et al., 2020). Local-level research in China and south Asia shows, however, that the potential for remittances to generate improvements in household level adaptive capacity is highly context specific, has significant gender dimensions and depends on such factors as the nature of the hazard, the distance migrated and the length of time over which remittances are received (Banerjee et al., 2019a; Banerjee et al., 2019b). Social networks are a key asset in helping climate migrants overcome financial and structural impediments to their mobility, but these have their limits, particularly with respect to international migration (Semenza and Ebi, 2019). Since AR5, greater restrictions have emerged on movement between many low- and high-income countries (not including those necessitated by public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic), a trend that, if it continues, would generate additional constraints on destination choices for future climate migrants (McLeman, 2019). Transnational diasporic connections are a potential asset for building resilience in migrant-sending communities highly exposed to climatic risks, with migrants’ remittances potentially providing resources for long-term resilience building, recovery from extreme events and reducing income inequality (Bragg et al., 2018; Mosuela et al., 2015; Obokata and Veronis, 2018; Shayegh, 2017; Semenza and Ebi, 2019). Safe and orderly labour migration is consequently a potentially beneficial component of wider cross-sectoral approaches to building adaptive capacity and supporting sustainable development in regions highly exposed to climate risks (McLeman, 2019)."

The possibility that climate change may enlarge international migrant flows has in some policy discussions been interpreted as a potential threat to the security of destination countries (Sow et al., 2016; Telford, 2018), but there is little empirical evidence in peer-reviewed literature assessed for this chapter of climate migrants posing significant threats to security at state or international levels. There is also an inconsistency between framing in some policy discussions of undocumented migration (climate-related and other forms) as being ‘illegal’ and the objectives of the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees (McLeman, 2019). Although climate-related migrants are not officially recognised as refugees under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, terms such as ‘climate refugees’ are common in popular media and some policy discussions (Høeg and Tulloch, 2018; Wiegel et al., 2019). The framing of migration policy discussions is relevant, for example, in discussing climate adaptation options for Pacific Island Countries, where there is considerable disagreement over policies that range from a ‘migration with dignity’ approach that would liberalise labour migration in the Pacific region to those that see migration as a last resort option to be avoided as much as possible (McNamara, 2015; Farbotko and McMichael, 2019; Oakes, 2019; Remling, 2020). A more beneficial policy framing in terms of ensuring that future migration contributes to climate resilience and sustainable development has been established since AR5 within the framework of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (see Section 7.4.7.7)."

Existing research is modest and difficult to generalise with respect to the impacts of climate-related migration and displacement on social dynamics and stability in receiving destinations, with outcomes being tied to the attitudes and social acceptance of receiving communities and efforts to integrate migrant arrivals into the community (Koubi and Nguyen, 2020). Research from Kenya and Vietnam shows that residents of receiving communities view environmental drivers as being legitimate reasons for people to move and consequently tend not to stigmatise such migrants (Spilker et al., 2020). In these examples, urban residents viewed environmental motivations as being comparable to economic reasons for migrating and did not see climate-related migrants as posing any particular risks for receiving communities. However, case studies from India suggest that a lack of recognition by local authorities of climatic factors being legitimate drivers of rural–urban migration may lead to discrimination against migrants in terms of access to housing and other social protections, thereby undermining household resilience (Chu and Michael, 2018)."

Section 7.2.6.2 highlighted the particular vulnerability of immobile populations in the face of growing climatic risks. However, research suggests governments should be slow to label such populations as being ‘trapped’ or to actively promote relocations in the absence of local agreement that in situ adaptation options have been exhausted (Adams, 2016; Farbotko and McMichael, 2019). In the case of indigenous settlements, efforts made to incorporate traditional knowledge in decision-making and planning increase the potential for longer-term success (Manrique, 2018). Considerable health implications can emerge within populations that are relocated as part of a planned retreat, and represent an important consideration for planners that requires greater research (Dannenberg et al., 2019). Organised relocations are not inherently transformative in their outcomes but, depending on the circumstances under which they occur and on how issues of equity and respect for the rights of those affected are implemented, relocation could potentially represent a positive transformation (Siders et al., 2021)."

Recent examples illustrate the substantial financial costs of organised relocations, ranging from USD 10,000 per person in examples from Fiji to USD 100,000 per person in coastal Louisiana, USA (Hino et al., 2017). Organised relocations are politically and emotionally charged, may not necessarily be seen as desirable by exposed populations and are most successful when approached proactive and strategically to avoid increasing the socioeconomic vulnerability of those who are relocated (Jamero et al., 2017; Wilmsen and Webber, 2015; Chapin et al., 2016; McNamara et al., 2018; Hauer et al., 2019; Bertana, 2020). Key considerations for protecting the rights and well-being of people who might need to be resettled include proactive communication with and participation of the affected communities, availability of compensation, livelihood protection and ensuring there is permanence and security of tenure at the relocation destination (Tadgell et al., 2018). Availability of funds for resettlement, how to manage relocation from communally owned lands, how to value privately owned land to be abandoned and the potential for loss and damage claims are just some of the many potential complications (Marino, 2018; McNamara et al., 2018).

G7 governments initiated an integrated agenda for resilience (Rüttinger et al., 2015) and the Berlin Call for Action in 2019 sought a foreign policy platform to address climate security concerns, focusing on risk-informed planning, enhanced capacity for action within the UN and improvements to operational response to climate security risks (Federal Foreign Office, 2019).

Among its 23 objectives, the Compact explicitly encourages the international community to implement migration policies that facilitate voluntary migration and actively prepare for involuntary displacements due to climate change, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The Compact’s objectives include reducing barriers to legal and safe migration, and facilitating the freer flow of remittances between sending and receiving communities. By doing so the Compact aims to increase the potential for migration to make positive contributions to sustainable development and to adaptive capacity-building. It also contains specific provisions pertaining to climate- and disaster-related migration and displacement. Objective 2 of the Compact aims at reducing drivers of involuntary or low-agency migration and recommends that states establish systems for sharing information on environmental migration, develop climate adaptation and resilience strategies harmonised at sub-regional and regional levels, and cooperate on disaster risk prevention and response. Other objectives in the Compact relevant to climate-related migration include Objective 5 (increasing pathways for regular migration) and Objective 19 (facilitating migrants’ ability to contribute to sustainable development). Objective 18, which links migration with skills development, is consistent with the ‘migration with dignity’ approach to displacement risks (McNamara, 2015; Kupferberg, 2021). The 2018 Global Compact on Refugees observes that climate hazards increasingly interact with the drivers of refugee movements. The guidelines this Compact provides to governments regarding actions for addressing the causes of refugee movements and considerations for assisting and supporting refugees are useful for governments seeking guidance for all forms of displacement more generally, including displacement linked to climate change."

Such recommendations dovetail strongly with the objectives of the Compacts on Migration and Refugees as well as the Sendai Framework for DRR and the 2030 SDGs.

The 2020 UNEP report on gender and security recommends integrated policy frameworks, better financing to strengthen women’s roles in peacebuilding, integrated programme design, and further research on gender, climate and security linkages. Inclusive approaches recognise that much of the vulnerability that drives conflict risk is generated by existing inequality and marginalisation of large proportions of the population—for example women and youth—and that peace cannot be achieved without their needs being taken into account and without their participation in peace processes (Mosello et al., 2021). Diverse and inclusive partnerships also require ways to better engage local-level participation, and improve understanding of how to build consensus through human rights-based approaches that recognize non-violent conflict and protest to be potentially positive and constructive elements of transformational approaches to building resilience (Nursey-Bray, 2017; Ensor et al., 2018; Schipper et al., 2021). Addressing the lack of participation of researchers and experts from countries most at risk of conflict in many climate-related conflict and peacebuilding assessments and initiatives could also support this objective.

The UN’s Climate Security Mechanism, working across three UN departments, takes an integrated approach to analyse and support timely and appropriate responses to conflict risk, focusing on risk assessments and early warning systems to aid conflict prevention, climate-informed peace and security activities and conflict-sensitive development, and to promote inter-sectoral cooperation, partnership and information sharing (DPPA et al., 2020).

Increased risks for mental health and well-being are associated with changes caused by the impacts of climate change on climate-sensitive health outcomes and systems (see Figure FAQ7.1.2). Higher temperatures and changing geographical and seasonal precipitation patterns will facilitate the spread of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease and dengue fever, and water- and food-borne diseases.

The greater the scale of future warming and extreme events, the greater the potential scale of future, involuntary climate-related migration and displacement.Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has strong potential to reduce future involuntary climate-related migration and displacement."
wg2_ch07_FAQ 7.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate hazards have affected armed conflict within countries but the observed influence of climate is small relative to socioeconomic, political and cultural factors. Adverse impacts of climate change threaten to increase poverty and inequality, undermine progress in meetings Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and place strain on civil institutions—all of which are factors that contribute to the emergence or worsening of civil unrest and conflict. Climate change impacts on crop productivity and water availability can function as a ‘risk multiplier’ for conflict in areas that are already politically and/or socially fragile and, depending on circumstances, could increase the length or the nature of an existing conflict. Institutional initiatives within or between states to protect the environment and manage natural resources can serve simultaneously as mechanisms for engaging rival groups and adversaries to cooperate in policymaking and peacebuilding."
wg2_ch07_FAQ 7.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"The solution space includes policies, strategies and programmes that consider why, how, when and who should be involved to sustainably adapt to climate change. Effectively preparing for and managing the health risks of climate change requires considering the multiple interacting sectors that affect population health and effective functioning of health systems. Considering the close inter-connections between health, migration and conflict, interventions that address climate risks in one area often have synergistic benefits in others. For example, conflicts often result in large numbers of people being involuntarily displaced and facilitate the spread of climate-sensitive diseases; tackling the underlying causes of vulnerability and exposure that generate conflict reduces risks across all areas. A key starting point for health and well-being is strengthening public health systems so that they become more climate resilient, which also requires cooperation with other sectors (water, food, sanitation, transportation, etc.) to ensure appropriate funding and progress on sustainable development goals. Interventions to enhance protection against specific climate-sensitive health risks could reduce morbidity and mortality and prevent many losses and damages (Figure FAQ7.4.1). These range from malaria net initiatives, vector control programmes, health hazard (syndromic) surveillance and early warning systems, improving access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), heat action plans (HAPs), behavioural changes and integration with disaster risk reduction (DRR) and response strategies. More importantly, climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs) are essential to improve overall health and well-being, reduce underlying causes of vulnerability and provide a framework for prioritising mitigation and adaptation options that support sustainable development. Transformative changes in key sectors including water, food, energy, transportation and built environments offer significant co-benefits for health."
wg2_ch07_FAQ 7.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Many actions taken in other sectors to address the risks of climate change can lead to benefits for health and well-being. Adaptive urban design that provides greater access to green and natural spaces simultaneously enhances biodiversity, improves air quality and moderates the hydrological cycle; it also helps reduce health risks associated with heat stress and respiratory illnesses, and mitigates mental health challenges associated with congested urban living. Transitioning away from internal-combustion vehicles and fossil fuel-powered generating stations to renewable energy mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and lowers the risks of respiratory illnesses. Policies and designs that facilitate active urban transport (walking and bicycling) increase efficiency in that sector, reduce emissions, improve air quality and generate physical and mental health benefits for residents. Improved building and urban design that foster energy efficiency improve indoor air quality and reduce risks of heat stress and respiratory illness. Food systems that emphasise healthy, plant-centred diets reduce emissions in the agricultural sector while helping in the fight against malnutrition."
