wg2_ch05_5.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter assesses the scientific literature produced after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) dealing with past, current and future climate change effects on managed ecosystems that provide provisioning and cultural services. It spans low- and high-intensity production systems for food, feed, fibre and other ecosystem products."
wg2_ch05_5.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change has already had global impacts, including in high-income countries. Special emphasis is placed on the assessment of vulnerabilities of particular groups that are context- and location-specific, such as Indigenous Peoples and other minorities, women and small-scale food producers. The report builds on the IPCC AR5 and recent Special Reports. This chapter combines food systems, fibre, wood and other products from ecosystems previously detailed in separate chapters of AR5, with an increased focus on ecosystem services, including the long-term sustainability of the global food system (Figure 5.1). The chapter focuses on key climate risks, implementation and outcomes of adaptation solutions for different groups as well as limits to adaptation."
wg2_ch05_5.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"AR5 Chapter 7 (Porter et al., 2014) reported with high confidence that food production systems were being negatively impacted by climate change, including both terrestrial and aquatic food species (Porter et al., 2014). Increased temperatures will have large negative impacts on the food production system under 2°C warming by late 20th century, with temperatures exceeding 4°C posing even greater risk to global food security (Porter et al., 2014). Adaptation options are needed to reduce the risk from climate change, but there was limited information of their effectiveness."
wg2_ch05_5.1.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The 1.5°C Special Report concluded that climate-related risks to food security will rise under 1.5°C and will increase further under 2°C or higher. Above 1.5°C, currently available adaptation options will be much less effective and site-specific limits to adaptation will be reached for vulnerable regions and sectors. There was high confidence that limiting warming to 1.5°C will result in smaller net reductions in yields of major crops affecting food availability and nutrition, and that rising temperatures will adversely affect livestock via changes in feed quality, fertility, production, spread of diseases and water availability."
wg2_ch05_5.1.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) expanded beyond the 1.5°C report to provide more in-depth information on climate change interactions with food security, desertification and degradation. There was high confidence that climate risks, both for slow changes and extreme events, are interlinked with ecosystem services, health and food security, often cascading and potentially reinforcing effects. Climate change already affects all dimensions of food security, namely availability, access, utilisation and stability, by disrupting food production, quality, storage, transport and retail. These effects exacerbate competition for land and water resources, leading to increased deforestation, biodiversity reduction and loss of wetlands. With high certainty, limiting global warming would lower future risks related to land, such as water scarcity, fire, vegetation shifts, degradation, desertification and food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly for those most vulnerable today: small-scale food producers in low-income countries, Indigenous communities, women, and the urban poor. SRCCL assessed a range of adaptation pathways to increase food resilience."
wg2_ch05_5.1.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) identified climate change impacts of warming, deoxygenation and acidification of the ocean and reductions in snow, sea ice and glaciers as having major negative impacts on fisheries and crops watered from mountain runoff and agriculture. These impacts affect food provisioning of food and directly threaten livelihoods and food security of vulnerable coastal communities and glacier-fed river basins. Climate change impacts on fisheries will be particularly high in tropical regions, where reductions in catch are expected to be among the largest globally, leading to negative economic and social effects for fishing communities and with implications for the supply of fish and shellfish (high confidence). While specific impacts will depend on the level of global warming and mitigative action to improve fisheries and aquaculture management, some current management practices and extraction levels may not be viable in the future."
wg2_ch05_5.1.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"This chapter is taking a food systems approach similar to the food security chapter in SRCCL (Mbow et al., 2019), with close attention to food system linkages, interactions and impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity (Steffen et al., 2015; Raworth, 2017; Gerten et al., 2020). Food security is defined as “a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 2020). Food insecurity is often experienced as chronic hunger reported in the annual UN Food Security and Nutrition in the World (FAO, 2020), when a person is unable to consume enough food over an extended period. The chapter gives special attention to climate change impacts on acute food insecurity, which can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result of shocks risking determinants of food security and nutrition, and used to assess the need for humanitarian action (IPC Global Partners, 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.1.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change directly affects food systems, and the impacts on terrestrial or aquatic food production will become increasingly negative, although regionally some changes may be beneficial in the near future (Porter et al., 2014). Current food system trajectories are leading to biodiversity loss and land and aquatic ecosystem degradation without delivering food security, nutrition, and sustainable and healthy livelihoods to many (Steffen et al., 2015). Addressing climate change in isolation ignores these interconnections, which is why the chapter considers integrated adaptation solutions to allow humanity to thrive in the long term. At the same time, social foundations of equality, justice and political participation are crucial in order to move towards a safe operating space for humanity (Raworth, 2017). The SDGs provide the most comprehensive set of metrics of humanity’s progress in achieving equitable and thriving socio-ecological systems. Therefore, while the focus of this chapter is climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation of food systems, feed, fibre and other ecosystem products, other environmental and social challenges are considered concomitantly."
wg2_ch05_5.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Food system and natural systems interact via political, economic, social, cultural and demographic factors in complex ways, leading to food security and sustainability outcomes. The food system has a supply (production) and demand (consumption) side, connected via processing, trade and retail, with loss and waste streams all along the food chain. Natural ecosystems provide multiple services (regulating, supporting, provisioning, cultural) to the food system. Food security and nutrition strongly depend on the driving forces connecting food and natural systems while at the same time positively or negatively influencing them. Climate change frequently exacerbates the effects of other drivers of change, further limiting the environment within which humanity can safely operate and thrive. The chapter assesses how climate change affects the four pillars of food security and nutrition and how these effects can be mediated by various factors, including our adaptation responses, social equity, underlying ecosystem services and governance (Figure 5.1). Adaptation solutions are a major emphasis of this chapter, including many ecosystem-based adaptation options (Table 5.1), which fall under the broader umbrella of nature-based solutions (Seddon et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch05_5.1.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Ecosystem-based adaptation, defined as the ‘use of ecosystem management activities to increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to climate change’ (Campbell et al., 2009), has at its core the recognition that there are unexploited synergies in agricultural systems that can increase productivity and resilience. These can result from increasing biodiversity, adding organic matter to soils, integrating livestock and aquatic species, including aquaculture, into farming practices, broadening landscape practices to exploit crop–forestry synergies, supporting beneficial insect populations and altering pest management practices that have unintended negative consequences. In addition, the chapter considers socioeconomic strategies to build resilience in the food system, strengthening local and regional economies, building on Indigenous and local knowledge, and addressing social inequity, through inclusive, participatory and democratic governance of food systems (HLPE, 2019; Wezel et al., 2020)."

wg2_ch05_5.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Detection and attribution of climate change impacts on the food system remain challenging because many non-climate drivers are involved (Porter et al., 2014) but have been improved by recently developed climate model outputs tailored for impact attribution (Iizumi et al., 2018; Moore, 2020; Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Climate change has caused regionally different, but mostly negative, impacts on crop yields and quality and marketability of products (high confidence) (see Section 5.4.1 for observed impacts). There is medium evidence and high agreement  that the effects of human-induced climate warming since the pre-industrial era has had significantly negative effects on global crop production, acting as a drag on the growth of agricultural production (Iizumi et al., 2018; Moore, 2020; Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2021). One global study using an empirical model estimated the negative effect of anthropogenic warming trends from 1961 to 2017 to be on average 5.3% for three staple crops (5.9% for maize, 4.9% for wheat and 4.2% for rice) (Moore, 2020). Another study using a process-based crop model found a yield loss of 4.1% (0.5–8.4%) for maize and 4.5% (0.5–8.4%) for soybean between 1981 and 2010 relative to the non-warming condition, even with CO2 fertilisation effects (Iizumi et al., 2018). Human-induced warming trends since 1961 have also slowed down the growth of agricultural total factor productivity by 21% (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2021). Regionally, heat and rainfall extremes intensified by human-induced warming in West Africa have reduced millet and sorghum yields by 10–20%, and 5–15%, respectively (Sultan et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Methane emissions significantly impact crop yields by increasing temperatures as a greenhouse gas (GHG) and surface ozone concentrations as a precursor (medium confidence) (Shindell, 2016; Van Dingenen, 2018; Shindell et al., 2019). Shindell (2016) estimated a net yield loss of 9.5±3.0% for four major crops due to anthropogenic emissions (1850–2010), after incorporation of the positive effect of CO2 (6.5±1.0%) and the negative effects of warming (10.9±3.2%) and tropospheric ozone elevation (5.0±1.5%). Although these estimates were not linked with historical yield changes, more than half of the estimated yield loss is attributable to increasing temperature and ozone concentrations from methane emissions, suggesting the importance of methane mitigation in alleviating yield losses (medium confidence) (Section 5.4.1.4)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate change is already affecting livestock production (high confidence)  (Section 5.5.1). The effects include direct impacts of heat stress on mortality and productivity, and indirect impacts have been observed on grassland quality, shifts in species distribution and range changes in livestock diseases (Sections 5.5.1.1–5.5.1.3). Quantitative assessment of observed impacts is still limited."
wg2_ch05_5.2.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"In aquatic systems, more evidence has accumulated since AR5 on warming-induced shifts (mainly poleward) of species (high confidence) (Section 5.8.1, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter), causing significant challenges for resource allocation between different countries and fishing fleets. Quantitative assessments of climate change impacts on production are still limited, but Free et al. (2019) estimated a 4.1% global loss of the maximum sustainable yield of several marine fish populations from 1930 to 2010 due to climate change. The effects of climate change on aquaculture are apparent but diverse, depending on the types and species of aquaculture (high confidence) (Section 5.9.1). Temperature increases, acidification, salt intrusion, oxygen deficiency, floods and droughts have negatively impacted production via reduced growing suitability, mortalities or damages to infrastructure (Section 5.9.1)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"The impacts of climate change on food provisioning have cascading effects on key elements of food security, such as food prices, household income, food safety and nutrition of vulnerable groups (Peri, 2017; Ubilava, 2018; 5.11, 5.12). Climate extreme events are frequently causing acute food insecurity (Section 5.12.3, FSIN, 2021). There is growing evidence that human-induced climate warming has amplified climate extreme events (Seneviratne et al., 2021), but detection and attribution of food insecurity to anthropogenic climate change is still limited by a lack of long-term data and complexity of food systems (Phalkey et al., 2015; Cooper et al., 2019). A recent event attribution study by Funk (2018) demonstrated that anthropogenic enhancement of the 2015/2016 El Niño increased drought-induced crop production losses in Southern Africa. Human-induced warming also exacerbated the 2007 drought in southern Africa, causing food shortages, price spikes and acute food insecurity in Lesotho (Verschuur et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Key risks in this chapter are grouped into those related to food security, food safety and dietary health, livelihoods of people in related sectors and ecosystem services (Table 16.9). Determining when a risk is considered severe is challenging to quantify because of the complexity of the food system, uncertainty about the effects and ethical challenges."
wg2_ch05_5.2.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Current levels of food insecurity are already high in some parts of the world, and often exacerbated by short-term food shortages and price spikes caused by weather extremes partly linked to climate change (Sections 5.2.1, 5.12.3, 16.5.2). Climate change will increase malnourished populations through direct impacts on food production and have cascading impacts on food prices and household incomes, all of which will reduce access to safe and nutritious food (high confidence)  (Figure 5.2, 5.12)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Extreme climate events will become more frequent and force some of the current food production areas beyond the safe climatic space for production (high confidence) (Sections 5.4.3, 5.5.2). Globally, 10% of the currently suitable area for major crops and livestock is projected to be climatically unsuitable in mid-century and 31–34% by the end of the century under SSP5-8.5 (Kummu et al., 2021). Adverse effects of climate change on food production will become more severe when global temperatures rise by more than 2°C (Sections 5.4.4.1, 5.12.4.1). One study estimated that the heat stress from projected 3°C warming above baseline (1986–2005) would reduce labour capacity by 30–50% in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, leading to a 5% increase in crop prices because of higher labour cost and production losses, thereby undermining food availability, access and livelihood (de Lima et al., 2021). Thiault et al. (2019) projected that, by 2100, climate change under RCP8.5 could have negative impacts on both agriculture and marine fisheries productivity in countries where 90% of the world population live. A global analysis of shellfish aquaculture estimated that habitat suitability will decline beyond 2060 globally, but much sooner in some Asian countries (Stewart-Sinclair et al., 2020; 5.9.1). These negative effects in the second half of the century will be much less under RCP2.6."
wg2_ch05_5.2.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Climate change impacts will increase the number of people at risk of hunger, in 2050 ranging from 8 million people under SSP1 to 80 million people under SSP3 scenarios (RCP6.0), compared with a world with no climate change (Mbow et al., 2019). Estimates also vary depending on the adaptation and mitigation assumptions (Hasegawa et al., 2018; Janssens et al., 2020). Geographically, nearly 80% of the population at risk of hunger are projected to reside in Africa and Asia (Nelson et al., 2018). Projections of risk of hunger beyond 2050 are limited, but it will grow from the mid-century towards the end of the century, with more people at risk under RCP8.5 compared with RCP4.5 (Richardson et al., 2018). Regional disparity is projected to increase, particularly under a high-emission scenario."
wg2_ch05_5.2.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Climate change will increase the costs and management challenges of providing safe food. The safety challenges arise from contamination caused by increased prevalence of pathogens, HAB and toxic inorganic bioaccumulation (high confidence) (Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.11, 5.12). Micronutrient deficiency is prevalent across many regions and will continue to be a problem at least during the first half of the century (Nelson et al., 2018), with significant implications for human health (Section 5.12.4)."
wg2_ch05_5.2.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Food security and healthy balanced diets will also be undermined by reduced livelihoods and health of people in agriculture and food-related sectors (Sections 5.12.3, 5.12.4), diminished ecosystem services provided by pollinators, the soil biome (Section 5.4.3) and water systems, and climate-mitigation related policies that solely focus on reducing GHG emissions without considering their potential to increase competition with food production for scarce land and water (Section 5.13.3)."
wg2_ch05_5.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Chapter text draws on previous IPCC reports, other reports (i.e., High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)), and literature published since 2014. This section highlights key trends in research topics and methods since AR5."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there are more examples of observed impacts from past climate change in cropping systems (Section 5.4.1), pastoral systems (Section 5.5.1), forests (Section 5.6.1), fisheries (Section 5.8.1) and mixed farming systems (Section 5.10.1). These assessments of observed impacts make use of historical data on climate, production area and yield to attribute the role of climate in driving changes in suitability, production, yield, food quality or total factor productivity (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2021). Observations across the global food systems have been analysed (Cottrell et al., 2019), with the advantage that unexpected impacts due to changes in seasonality and biotic interactions can be detected. Quantitative analysis is only possible in places with adequate historical data; in many cases, studies rely on qualitative assessments, often drawing on farmers’ perceptions of climate impacts."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Projecting future climate impacts relies on modelling that combines climate data with data from experimental studies testing how species respond to each climate factor. In cropping and forest systems, a network of experimental studies with plants exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations, ozone and elevated temperature provides data on the fundamental responses to climate and atmospheric conditions (i.e., free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) and temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) systems). FACE results have been combined and assessed more extensively since AR5 (Bishop et al., 2014; Haworth et al., 2016; Kimball, 2016; Ainsworth and Long, 2021). Field-based FACE studies have several advantages over more enclosed testing chambers, although results from more controlled experiments and coordination between different methods continue to give new insights into crop responses to climate change and variability (Drag et al., 2020; Ainsworth and Long, 2021; Sun et al., 2021). Experimental results have limitations and can be difficult to scale up (Porter et al., 2014; Haworth et al., 2016), but generally the conclusions follow known plant responses (Lemonnier and Ainsworth, 2018). As highlighted in AR5, there is a scarcity of FACE infrastructure in the tropics and subtropics (Leakey et al., 2012; Lemonnier and Ainsworth, 2018; Toreti et al., 2020). One area that has been investigated further is the negative impact of elevated CO2 on crop nutritional value, which has important implications for human nutrition (Scheelbeek et al., 2018; Smith and Myers, 2018; Toreti et al., 2020; Ainsworth and Long, 2021). Increasingly, experimental studies seek to examine the interaction between climatic factors such as temperature, drought and ozone, or the responses of understudied food systems, crop species, cultivars and management interventions (Kimball, 2016; Ainsworth and Long, 2021). The use of experimental data to improve projections has also expanded in other systems. There has been an increased focus on the impact of warming on livestock health and productivity (5.5.3). Aquatic system studies have incorporated projected impacts on physiology, distribution, phenology and productivity (5.8.3)."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Modelling approaches differ widely and serve different purposes (Table 5.2; Porter et al., 2014; Jones, 2017a). The use of process-based and statistical modelling alongside remote sensing and other spatial data has grown. Projections increasingly draw on a combination of modelling approaches and coordinated efforts for model intercomparisons and ensemble techniques, using standardised emission scenarios (RCPs). For major crops, models of global yield impacts from CO2 concentration, air temperature and precipitation have been refined and compared (Challinor et al., 2014; Iizumi et al., 2017; Ruane et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Rojas et al., 2019). Despite advances since AR5, modelling is still constrained by limited data from field experiments (Ruane et al., 2017). Increasingly, studies attempt to incorporate effects of elevated CO2, ozone and climate extremes (Barlow et al., 2015; Schauberger et al., 2019a; Vogel et al., 2019), as well as attempts to incorporate more complex interactions with soil and crop management (Basso et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2020b). However, only a few models consider crop protein content and other quality factors (Nuttall et al., 2017; Asseng et al., 2019). Some models take account of the impacts of climate on the timing of key biological events (phenology) in the target species; however, incorporating biotic interactions with pests, pathogens and pollinators remains a challenge (Table 5.2; Sections 5.4.1, 5.4.3)."

Model types are categorised by: food system, with labels representing the food systems from this chapter where each model type is used ({CROP}, {TREE}, {LIVES}, {FISH}, {MIX}, {FOOD}); scale over which each model type is usually applied local [()], regional [( )], global [( )], or a combination of these); and sensitivity to climate change where the colour intensity indicates the ability of each model type to incorporate each of the listed factors. After Van Wijk et al. (2014), Kanter et al. (2018) and Thornton (2018). Integrated assessment models are discussed in the main text."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"In addition to productivity projections, research also draws on climate suitability estimates (Table 5.2). These compare the known climate suitability of species and habitats with projected climate conditions across different locations. Such projections are useful especially for incorporating movement of pests and pathogens but cannot be applied in isolation if non-climate constraints are not considered. As different research groups use different assumptions and data inputs, more coordination is needed if suitability projections are to be compared globally (SM5.3)."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Increasingly, projections look across different disciplines and across multiple components of the food system, including livestock, fisheries and mixed farming systems (Campbell et al., 2016; Mbow et al., 2019). Major timber species have been modelled, with projected impacts on productivity, duration of rotation and distribution (i.e., climate suitability) (Albert et al., 2018). Livestock systems are influenced by plant productivity projections via their feedstock, for example, rangeland cattle impacted by changes in net primary production (NPP) (Boone et al., 2018). Direct climate impacts on animals are also projected, using indices based on direct observations (Section 5.5.3). Since AR5, Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP) has allowed for global intercomparisons and ensemble projections of marine fisheries, and projections capturing interactions from multiple food systems (e.g., Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP); Sections 5.8, 5.10)."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p8,NO_TITLE,"Global simulations have uncovered important differences between regions (Deryng et al., 2016; Blanchard et al., 2017). Efforts to coordinate and combine regional and global modelling studies allow for greater insight into regional differences in climate change impacts, such as the Coordinated Global and Regional Assessments (CGRA) performed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) (Blanchard et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2017; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Ruane et al., 2018; Lotze et al., 2019). Increasingly, multi-model intercomparisons are used to evaluate global gridded crop models’ performance and sensitivity to temperature, water, nitrogen and CO2 within AgMIP, with the focus mostly on major annual crops (Valdivia et al., 2015; Ruane et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2021a). Differences in model type, structures and input data can result in large variation in projections, particularly for the response of crops to elevated CO2 and temperature (5.4.3.1); methods for quantifying and minimising this uncertainty have been developed, but improvement is still needed ( Asseng et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2017; Folberth et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2020; Müller et al., 2021a; Ruane et al., 2021). The use of multi-model intercomparisons has widened the range of uncertainties but has increased the robustness of impact assessments (Asseng et al., 2013; Challinor et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2017). Model outputs are strongly influenced by decisions over which factors to include; for example, including drought impacts can result in positive yield projections switching to neutral or negative values (Gray et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2018). Models are also limited in their ability to incorporate socioeconomic drivers and extreme events (Porter et al., 2014; Campbell et al., 2016; Ruane et al., 2017; Jagermeyr and Frieler, 2018; Webber et al., 2018; Schewe et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.3.1_p9,NO_TITLE,"For long-term projections and integrated assessments, a large component of uncertainty remains in the ability to represent socioeconomic responses to climate change and the degree to which these will mitigate or exacerbate climatic changes (Valdivia et al., 2015; Prestele et al., 2016; Arneth et al., 2019). This includes the potential adaptation responses of food producers. Models that incorporate alternative socioeconomic responses offer one solution (e.g., AgMIP) (Nelson et al., 2014; Von Lampe et al., 2014; Wiebe et al., 2015; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; van Zeist et al., 2020). Another approach is the use of solution-oriented scenarios to compare the effectiveness of adaptation options (Le Mouël and Forslund, 2017; Arneth et al., 2019), or to quantify the time period in which adaptation responses will become essential (Challinor et al., 2016; Rojas et al., 2019). Others point to the necessity of managing food systems within the context of uncertainty (Campbell et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch05_5.3.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Methods for monitoring vulnerability and adaptation are under-researched but have increased since AR5. Increasingly, projections move from individual crops to assessing risks across the food systems and the relative vulnerability of different systems (Campbell et al., 2016; Gil et al., 2017; Lipper et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2018). Adaptation options can be considered as parameters in integrated models, such as those used in ISI-MIP, while others use systematic assessments of case studies, such as the application of agent-based household models to assessments of adaptation in livestock systems (Section 5.5.4). Quantitative studies are less common than qualitative assessments, and there is a need to combine modelling and qualitative approaches more effectively (Beveridge et al., 2018a; Vermeulen et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch05_5.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"The food system is dynamic, with changes in management practices driven by many factors, including climate adaptation (Iizumi, 2019; Iizumi et al., 2021a). Adaptation potential, such as expected advances in crop breeding, are often not explicitly accounted for in modelling studies, but more recent studies do quantify the potential for adaptation (Iizumi et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2017; Aggarwal et al., 2019; Minoli et al., 2019). To account for this complexity, case studies rely on data derived from the perception and practices of stakeholders who are engaged in adaptation (usually autonomous adaptation) (Hussain et al., 2016; Lipper et al., 2017; Ankrah, 2018; Sousa-Silva et al., 2018). Case studies use a range of different indicators to monitor climate response options, making quantitative comparisons more difficult (Gil et al., 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2018). However, systematic comparisons have provided valuable insights (Descheemaeker et al., 2018; Shaffril et al., 2018; Aggarwal et al., 2019; Bene et al., 2019); for example, the sustainable livelihood framework has been applied widely to diverse aquatic systems (Bueno and Soto, 2017; Barange and Cochrane, 2018) and the Livelihood Vulnerability Index is well used across systems (Section 5.1 4). Coordinated efforts such as the AgMIP also provide systematic assessments (Blanchard et al., 2017; Lipper et al., 2017; Antle et al., 2018). Nonetheless, the full effectiveness of different adaptation options is difficult to assess given that many impacts have not yet occurred (due to the cumulative nature of impacts and the inertia in the climate system) (Stocker et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013)."

Some studies, however, observed prolonged crop growth duration despite the warming trends (Mueller et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2016; Butler et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018b) because of shifts in planting dates and/or adoption of longer-duration cultivars in mid-to-high latitudes. Conversely, in mid-to-low latitudes in Asia, a review study found that farmers favoured early maturing cultivars to reduce risks of damages due to drought, flood and/or heat (Shaffril et al., 2018), suggesting that region-specific adaptations are already occurring in different parts of the world (high confidence)."

Climate factors that affected long-term yield trends also differ between regions. For example, in Western Africa, 1°C warming above preindustrial climate has increased heat and rainfall extremes, and reduced yields by 10–20% for millet and 5–15% for sorghum (Sultan et al., 2019). In Australia, declined rainfall and increased temperatures reduced yield potential of wheat by 27%, accounting for the low yield growth between 1990 and 2015 (Hochman et al., 2017). In Southern Europe, climate warming has negatively impacted yields of almost all major crops, leading to recent yield stagnation (Moore and Lobell, 2015; Agnolucci and De Lipsis, 2020; Brás et al., 2021)."

Drought-related yield losses have occurred in about 75% of the global harvested area (Kim et al., 2019b) and increased in recent years (Lesk et al., 2016). Heatwaves have reduced yields of wheat (Zampieri et al., 2017) and rice (Liu et al., 2019b). The combined effects of heat and drought decreased global average yields of maize, soybeans and wheat by 11.6%, 12.4% and 9.2%, respectively (Matiu et al., 2017). In Europe, crop losses due to drought and heat have tripled over the last five decades (Brás et al., 2021), pointing to the importance of assessing multiple stresses.

In temperate regions, climate change can result in higher yields (Potopová et al., 2017; Bisbis et al., 2018), while in subtropical/tropical regions, negative impacts from heat and drought take precedence (Scheelbeek et al., 2018). Different species have different sensitivities to heat and drought (Prasad et al., 2017; Scheelbeek et al., 2018) and to combinations of stresses (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Above-ground vegetables are especially vulnerable to heat and drought stress during pollination and fruit set, resulting in negitive impacts on yield (Daryanto et al., 2017; Sita et al., 2017; Brás et al., 2021) and harvest quality (Mattos et al., 2014; Bisbis et al., 2018).

These crops are considered stress tolerant but are more sensitive to drought than cereals (Daryanto et al., 2017).

Concerns about climate impacts on harvest quality are widespread (Figure 5.3) (Barnuud et al., 2014; Bonada et al., 2015). In higher-latitude regions, the primary concern is the effect of temperature variability on harvest stability, pests and diseases and phenology (including fulfilment of winter chill requirements and risks due to early emergence in spring), (El Yaacoubi et al., 2014; Ramírez and Kallarackal, 2015; Santos et al., 2017; Gitea et al., 2019). In lower-latitude regions, information is limited, but studies are focused on increased tree mortality and yield loss due to drought, heat and impacts from variability in the timing of the wet and dry seasons (Glenn et al., 2013; Ramírez and Kallarackal, 2015); see Box 5.7). In fruit trees, warming and climate variability have already affected fruit quality, such as acidity and texture in apples, or skin colour in grape berries (Sugiura et al., 2013; Sugiura et al., 2018). The reliability and stability of harvests has been impacted by climate variability, changes in the distribution of pests and pathogens (Seidel, 2014; Bois et al., 2017), and the mismatch of important phenological events (such as bud emergence and flowering) (Guo and Shen, 2015; Legave et al., 2015; Ito et al., 2018; Vitasse et al., 2018). Perennial crops are particularly vulnerable to these impacts as they are exposed throughout the year, with little potential for growers to adjust planting date or location. Negative impacts via disruption to phenology and pest dynamics are best studied in grapevine (see Box 5.2)."

Different pest species populations respond differently to ongoing climate change, with some shifting, contracting or expanding their current distribution range and others persisting or disappearing in their current range (high confidence). These asymmetric distribution changes can create novel species combinations or decouple existing ones (Pecl et al., 2017; Hobbs et al., 2018), but their consequences on future crop production and food security are hard to predict. Multi-species climate change experiments are rare (Bonebrake et al., 2018), but one study shows that under future climates different pest assemblages of interacting species may alter levels of damage to crops compared with that by only one species (Crespo-Perez et al., 2015). Some studies highlight the importance of location-specific species interactions for more realistic projections of pest distribution, performance and damage to crops, which in turn would allow more effective prevention and pest control strategies (Wilson et al., 2015; Carrasco et al., 2018)."

First, changes in temperature and precipitation alter the range, composition and competitiveness of native and invasive weeds (Bradley et al., 2010). Second, rising concentrations of CO2 enhance growth of C3 species (~85% of plant species, including many weeds) (Ogren and Chollet, 1982; Ziska, 2003), and increase plant water use efficiency with potentially strong effects on invasive plant species establishment (Smith et al., 2000; Belote et al., 2004; Blumenthal et al., 2013)."

The range of other invasive weeds may become static, or even decline (Bradley et al., 2016; Buckley and Csergo, 2017). A recent meta-analysis also supports that invasive plants respond more favourably to elevated CO2 concentrations and elevated temperatures than native plants (Korres et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). Movement of invasive species into low-fertility areas, however, could provide resource opportunities, especially if agriculture in those areas is limited (Randriambanona et al., 2019)."

Intense rainfall also reduces persistence (Delcour et al., 2015). Invasive pests and pathogens impose an additional cost for the society (Bradshaw et al., 2016). Rapid and large-scale dispersal of pests is already a major threat to food security, as exemplified by the recent outbreak of desert locusts (see Box 5.8), indicating the importance of international cooperation. Taken together, the need for control of pests, disease and weeds will increase under climate change (medium evidence, high agreement ). The use of toxic agricultural chemicals also has human health and environmental risks (Whitmee et al., 2015; IPBES, 2019).

This is of particular relevance for fruit and vegetable crops given their importance in human nutrition (high confidence) (see Section 5.12.4 for potential impacts on nutrition; Nelson et al., 2018; Springmann et al., 2018). Recent experimental studies (Section 5.3.2), however, show some complex and counteracting interactions between CO2 and temperature in wheat, soybean and rice; heat stress negates the adverse effect of elevated CO2 on some nutrient elements (Macabuhay et al., 2018; Kohler et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b). The CO2 by temperature interaction for grain quality needs to be better understood quantitatively to predict food nutritional security in the future."

Additional research confirms that climate change will disproportionately affect crop yields among regions, with more negative than positive effects being expected in most areas, especially in currently warm regions, including Africa and Central and South America (high confidence)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"A systematic literature search between 2014 and 2020 resulted in about 100 peer-reviewed papers that simulated crop yields of four major crops (maize, rice, soybean and wheat) using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data (Hasegawa et al., 2021b). Most studies focus on the relative change in crop yields due to climate change but do not consider technological advances. Nevertheless, they provide useful insights into time-, scenario- and warming-degree-dependent impacts of climate change."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"The impact of climate change on crop yield without adaptation projected in the 21st century is generally negative even with the CO2 fertilisation effects, with the overall median per-decade effect being −2.3% for maize, −3.3% for soybean, −0.7% for rice and −1.3% for wheat, which is consistent with previous IPCC assessments (Porter et al., 2014). The effects vary greatly within each crop, timeframe and RCP, but show a few common features across crops (Figure 5.6a ). Differences in the projected impacts between RCPs are not pronounced by mid-century. From then onward, the negative effect becomes more pronounced under RCP8.5, notably in maize. Rice yields show less variation across models than other crops presumably because simulations are mostly under irrigated conditions. A part of the uncertainty in the projection is due to regional differences (Figure 5. 6b). Negative impacts on cereals are projected in Africa and Central and South America at the end of the century, which agrees with the previous studies (Aggarwal et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"The differences due to regions, RCPs and timeframes are related to the current temperature level and degree of warming (Figure 5.7). The projected effects of climate change are positive where current annual mean temperatures (Tave) are below 10°C, but they become negative with Tave above around 15°C. At Tave> 20°C, even a small degree of warming could result in adverse effects. In maize, negative effects are apparent at almost all temperature zones. A new study using the latest climate scenarios (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, CMIP6) and global gridded crop model ensemble projected that climate change impacts on major crop yields appear sooner than previously anticipated, mainly because of warmer climate projections and improved crop model sensitivities (Jägermeyr et al., 2021)."

For example, based on the temperature response of insect pest population and metabolic process, global yield losses of rice, maize and wheat are projected to increase by 10–25% per degree Celsius of warming (Deutsch et al., 2018). Rising temperatures reduce soil carbon and nitrogen, which in turn exacerbate the negative effects of +3°C warming on yield from 9% to 13% in wheat and from 14% to 19% in maize (Basso et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"A few studies have examined possible occurrences of tele-connected yield losses (5.4.1.2) using future climate scenarios. Tigchelaar (2018) estimated that, for the top four maize-exporting countries, the probability that simultaneous production losses greater than 10% occur in any given year increases from 0% to 7% under 2°C warming and to 86% under 4°C warming. Gaupp (2019) estimated that risks of simultaneous failure in maize would increase from 6% to 40% at 1.5°C and to 54% at 2°C warming, relative to the historical baseline climate. Large-scale changes in SST are the major factors causing simultaneous variation in climate extremes, which are projected to intensify under global warming (Cai et al., 2014; Perry et al., 2017). Consequently, risks of simultaneous yield losses in major food-producing regions will also increase with global warming levels above 1.5°C (medium confidence). Further examination is needed for the effects of spatial patterns of these extremes on breadbaskets in relation to SST anomalies under more extreme climate scenarios."

Methane, therefore, reduces crop yield both from climate warming and ozone increase (Avnery et al., 2013). Shindell (2016) estimated yield losses of four major crops (to be 25±11% by 2100 under RCP8.5, as a net balance of the positive effect of CO2 (15±2%) and negative effects of warming (35±10%) and ozone (4.0±1.3%), and that 62% of the yield loss was attributable to methane. This points to the importance of reducing methane and other precursors of ozone as an effective adaptation strategy (medium evidence, high agreement )."

Springmann et al. (2016), compared the projected global food availability for different food groups under the SSP2 2050 scenario and found reductions in availability were similar in cereals, fruit and vegetables, and root and tubers (with legumes and oilseed crops showing a smaller reduction)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Fruit and vegetables have not been subject to extensive or coordinated yield projections (Figure 5.8). Yield projections have been performed for individual crops and locations (Ruane, 2014; Adhikari et al., 2015; Awoye et al., 2017; Ramachandran et al., 2017), but more often crop suitability models have been used (SM5.3). Zhao (2019) introduced a modelling approach that could be used to generate yield projections for a wider range of annual crops. The discussion here also draws on reviews of more restricted experimental studies. Negative impacts of climate change on crop production are expected across many cropping systems (Figure 5.8). Apart from the direct effects of elevated carbon dioxide, most changes are expected to have negative effects on crop production. Changes in temperature and rainfall are most often mentioned as drivers of climate impacts, but expected changes in phenology, pests and diseases are also raising concerns. Scheelbeek et al. (2018) synthesised projections for vegetables and legumes, based on their response to climate factors under experimental conditions; in most cases, the magnitude of the changes is comparable to the RCP8.5 2100 forecasts. Scheelbeek et al. (2018) projected yield changes of: +22.0% (+11.6% to +32.5%) for a 250 ppm increase in CO2 concentration; −34.7% (−44.6% to −24.9%) for a 50% reduction in water availability; −8.9% (−15.6% to −2.2%) for a 25% increase in ozone concentration; −31.5% for a 4°C increase in temperature (in papers with a baseline temperature of >20°C). Overall, impacts are expected to be largely negative in regions where the temperature is currently above 20°C, while some yield gains are expected in cooler regions (provided that water availability and other conditions are maintained). Scheelbeek et al. (2018) did not consider changes in pest and disease pressure, which are projected to increase with warming (see SM5.3)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Systematic assessments of climate response for root crops as a group are lacking (Raymundo et al., 2014; Knox et al., 2016; Manners and van Etten, 2018). Climate suitability is projected to increase for tropical root crops (SM5.3), and some studies have found that root crops will be less negatively impacted than cereals, but there is no consensus on this (Brassard and Singh, 2008; Adhikari et al., 2015; Schafleitner, 2016; Manners et al., 2021). For potato, Raymundo et al. (2018) projected global yield reductions of 2–6% by 2055 under different RCPs, but with important differences among regions; tuber dry weight may experience reductions of 50–100% in marginal growing areas such as central Asia, while increases of up to 25% are expected in many high-yielding environments. Projections show yield increases of 6% per 100 ppm elevation in CO2 but declines of 4.6% per degree Celsius and 2% per 10% decrease in rainfall (Fleisher et al., 2017). Jennings et al. (2020) projected an overall increase in global potato production, but only if widespread adoption of adaptation measures is achieved. Although increases in CO2 could produce positive yield responses, the effects of temperature may offset these potential benefits (Dua et al., 2013; Raymundo et al., 2014). Warming offers the potential of longer growing seasons but can also have negative impacts through disrupted phenology and interactions with pests (Figure 5.8, Bebber, 2015; Pulatov et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.3.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"Global yield modelling is lacking for woody perennial crops. Experimental studies suggest negative impacts on yields due to reduced water supply and increased soil salinity, as well as from warming and ozone (although evidence was limited for these) (Alae-Carew et al., 2020). Increasing CO2 is expected to increase yields, but only where other factors, such as warming, do not become yield-limiting (Alae-Carew et al., 2020). Many local projections include large uncertainty because of a lack of observational data and reliable parametrisation (Moriondo et al., 2015; Mosedale et al., 2016; Kerr et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2019b). Most perennial crop models have found large negative impacts on yield and suitability, although CO2 fertilisation and phenology are not always considered (Lobell and Field, 2011; Glenn et al., 2013). Perennial crops are often grown in dryland areas where rainfall or irrigation water can be critical (Mrabet et al., 2020). Valverde (2015) found that yield losses in the Mediterranean region were largely driven by reduced rainfall, with maximum estimated yield losses of 5.4% for grape, 14.9% for olive and 27.2% for almond under a relatively hot and dry scenario (by 2041–2070). Moriondo (2015) highlight the need for perennial crop models to incorporate phenology and extreme climate events. Equally challenging is the need to estimate the impact of biotic changes, particularly climate-driven movement of pests and diseases (Ponti et al., 2014; Bosso et al., 2016; Schulze-Sylvester and Reineke, 2019)."

Climate change is also expected to increase the demand for irrigation water, which will likely limit production (Jans et al., 2021).

SOM holds a great proportion of the nutrients, and regulates important soil physical, chemical and biological processes, such as cation exchange capacity, pH buffering, soil structure, water-holding capacity and microbial activity (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Soils also hold the largest terrestrial organic carbon stock, three to four times greater than the atmosphere (Stoorvogel et al., 2017). At the global scale, climate and vegetation are the main drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage (Wiesmeier et al., 2019). While organic matter input is the primary driver of SOC stocks (Fujisaki et al., 2018), temperature and soil moisture play a key role in SOC storage at the local scale (Carvalhais et al., 2014; Doetterl et al., 2015).

The effects of increasing SOC are more positive in drylands owing to more efficient use of rainwater, which can increase drought tolerance (Iizumi and Wagai, 2019). Similarly, Sun et al. (2020) found that, relative to local conventional tillage, conservation agriculture has a win-win outcome of enhanced C sequestration and increased crop yield in arid regions. However, the impact of no-till may be minimal if not supplemented with residue cover and cover crops. As such, this is a highly debated area where some authors argue that no-till has limited effect and the evidence outside drylands is weak. Furthermore, the use of crop residues is constrained by its alternative uses (e.g., fuel, livestock feed, etc.) in much of the developing world.

wg2_ch05_5.4.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Crop management practices are the most commonly studied adaptation measures (Shaffril et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2019a; Muchuru and Nhamo, 2019), but quantitative assessments are mostly limited to existing agronomic options such as changes in planting schedules, cultivars and irrigation (Beveridge et al., 2018a; Aggarwal et al., 2019). This section draws on the global data set used in Section 5.4.3.2 (Hasegawa et al., 2021b) to estimate adaptation potential, defined as the difference in simulated yields with and without adaptations. A caveat to the analysis is that the data set includes management options if the literature treats them as adaptation. They include intensification measures such as fertilizer and water management, not allowing for physical and economic feasibility."
wg2_ch05_5.4.4.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The overall adaptation potential of existing farm management practices to reduce yield losses averaged 8% in mid-century and 11% in end-century (Figure 5.9), which is insufficient to offset the negative impacts from climate change, particularly in currently warmer regions (Section 5.4.3.2). Emission scenarios, crop species, regions and adaptation options do not show discernible differences. Combinations of two or more options do not necessarily have greater adaptation potential than a single option, though a fair comparison is difficult in the data set from independent studies. One regional study in West Africa found that currently promising management would no longer be effective under future climate, suggesting the need to evaluate effectiveness under projected climate change."
wg2_ch05_5.4.4.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"A global-scale meta-analysis estimated a 3–7% yield loss per degree Celsius increase in temperature (Zhao et al., 2017). Two global-scale studies using multiple global gridded crop models found that growing-season adaptation through cultivar changes offsets global production losses up to 2°C of temperature increase (Minoli et al., 2019; Zabel et al., 2021). While these studies do not account for CO2 fertilisation effects, another global-scale study with the CO2 fertilisation effects (Iizumi et al., 2020) showed that residual damage (climate change impacts after adaptation) would start to increase almost exponentially from 2040 towards the end of the century under RCP8.5. The cost required for adaptation and due to residual damage is projected to rise from USD 63 billion at 1.5°C to USD 80 billion at 2°C and to USD 128 billion at 3°C (Iizumi et al., 2020). All these global studies project that risks and damages are greater in tropical and arid regions, where crops are exposed to heat and drought stresses more often than in temperate regions (Sun et al., 2019; Kummu et al., 2021; SM5.4). There are still large uncertainties in the crop model projections (Müller et al., 2021a), but these multiple lines of evidence suggest that warming beyond +2°C (projected to be reached by mid-century under high-emission scenarios) will substantially increase the cost of adaptation and the residual damage to major crops (high confidence). The residual damage will prevail much sooner in currently warmer regions, where the effect of even a modest temperature increase is greater (Section 5.4.3.2)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.4.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Most crop modelling studies on adaptation are still limited to a handful of options for each crop type (Beveridge et al., 2018a). A range of other options are possible not just to reduce yield losses but to diversify risks to livelihoods, which are partially assessed in Sections 5.4.4.4 and 5.14.1. Current modelling approaches are not suited for the assessment of multiple dimensions of adaptation options. New studies are emerging that evaluate multiple options for productivity, sustainability and GHG emission (Xin and Tao, 2019; Smith et al., 2020b), but local- and household-scale assessment, taking account of future climatic variability, needs to be enhanced (Beveridge et al., 2018a)."
wg2_ch05_5.4.4.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Across this diverse group of cropping systems, distinct adaptation options and adaptation limits have emerged (Figure 5.10; Acevedo et al., 2020; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021b). Some crop types have already seen widescale implementation of climate adaptation (e.g., grapevines), while others show little evidence of preparation for climate change (e.g., leafy salad crops). Many adaptation responses are shared with the major crops, but prominent options such as plant breeding are underutilised and there is a lack of evidence for assessing adaptation for many crops (Bisbis et al., 2018; Gunathilaka et al., 2018; Manners and van Etten, 2018). Figure 5.10 assesses several adaptation options based on the perceived importance of each in the literature. Fruit and vegetable crops tend to be more reliant on ecosystem services in the form of pollination, biocontrol and other resources (water, nutrients, microbes, etc.), and ecosystem-based adaptation options are prominent. The range of crops means that there is great potential for crop switching, but cultural and economic barriers will make such options difficult to implement, with barriers to entry for production and marketing (Waha et al., 2013; Magrini et al., 2016; Kongsager, 2017; Rhiney et al., 2018). Perennial crops are exposed to a wide range of climate factors throughout the year and have significant barriers to implementing some of the common adaptation options, such as relocation or replacing tree species/cultivar; agronomic interventions on-farm are well used in high-value tree crops and provide some climate resilience, but longer-term options will be needed (Glenn et al., 2013; Mosedale et al., 2016; Gunathilaka et al., 2018; Sugiura, 2019)."

Desirable traits that adapt plants to environmental stress are inherited as a complex of genes, each of which makes a small contribution to the trait (Negin and Moshelion, 2017). Adaptation by conventional breeding requires making rapid incremental changes in the best germplasm to keep pace with the environment (Millet et al., 2016; Atlin et al., 2017; Cobb et al., 2019). Further improvements would be difficult without in situ and ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources to maintain critical germplasm for breeding (Dempewolf et al., 2014; Castañeda-Álvarez et al., 2016)."

Emerging modern biotechnology such as gene/genome editing may in the future increase the ability to better translate genetic improvements into the field  (medium agreement , limited evidence)  (Puchta, 2017; Yamamoto et al., 2018; Friedrichs et al., 2019; Kawall, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b)."

However, breeding for smallholder farmers and the stresses caused by climate change are unlikely to be addressed by the private sector and will require more public investment and adjusting to the local social-ecological system (Glover, 2014; Heinemann et al., 2014; Acevedo et al., 2020).

At higher temperatures, animals eat 3–5% less per additional degree of temperature, reducing their productivity and fertility. Heat stress suppresses the immune and endocrine system, enhancing susceptibility of the animal to disease (Das et al., 2016b). Recent stagnation in dairy production in West Africa and China may be associated with increased periods of high daily temperatures (low confidence) (Rahimi et al., 2020; Ranjitkar et al., 2020). Increases in the productive capacity of domestic animals can compromise thermal acclimation and plasticity, creating further loss. Escalating demand for livestock products in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) may necessitate considerable adaptation in the face of new thermal environments (medium confidence) (Collier and Gebremedhin, 2015; Theusme et al., 2021). Heat effects on productivity have been summarised for pigs (da Fonseca de Oliveira et al., 2019), sheep and goats (Sejian et al., 2018), and cattle (Herbut et al., 2019). The direct effects of higher temperatures on the smaller ruminants (sheep and goats) are relatively muted, compared with large ruminants; goats are better able to cope with multiple stressors than sheep (Sejian et al., 2018). Under SSP5-8.5 to mid-century, land suitability for livestock production will decrease because of increased heat stress prevalence in mid and lower latitudes (high confidence) (Thornton et al., 2021)."

High-input livestock systems may consume more water than grazing or mixed systems, though water used per kg beef produced, for example, depends on country, context and system (Noya et al., 2019). In systems where feed production is rainfed, livestock and crop water productivity may be comparable (Haileslassie et al., 2009). Direct water consumption by livestock is <1–2% of global water consumption (Hejazi et al., 2014).

Over the last 75 years, >220 emerging zoonotic diseases, some associated with domesticated livestock, have been identified, several of which may be affected by climate change, particularly vector-borne diseases (Vaillancourt and Ogden, 2016; see Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2). Walsh et al. (2018) identified both temperature and rainfall as influential factors in predicting increasing anthrax outbreaks in northern latitudes. Growing infectious disease burdens in domesticated animals may have wide-ranging impacts on the vulnerability of rural livestock producers in the future, particularly related to human health and projected increases in zoonoses (high confidence) (Bett et al., 2017; Heffernan, 2018; Rushton et al., 2018; Meade et al., 2019)."

Although agriculture in parts of North America has become more sensitive to climate over the last 50 years, livestock have helped to moderate this effect, being less sensitive to increasing temperatures than some specialised crop systems (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2018). Increasing frequency and severity of droughts will affect the future economic viability of grassland-based livestock production in the North American Great Plains (Briske et al., 2021). Purchasing more forage and selling more livestock have reduced household vulnerability in semi-arid parts of China over the last 35 years (Bai et al., 2019). A greater focus on sheep production away from cropping has increased the resilience of farming systems in Western Australia in low-rainfall years, although with mixed environmental effects (Ghahramani and Bowran, 2018).

Women and men often have differential and unequal control over different productive assets and the benefits they provide, such as income from livestock (Ngigi et al., 2017; Musinguzi et al., 2018). Indigenous livestock keepers can be more vulnerable to climate change, partly due to ongoing processes of land fragmentation (Hobbs et al., 2008), historical land dispossession, discrimination and colonialisation, creating greater levels of poverty and marginalisation (Stephen, 2018). Adaptation actions may also be affected by gender and other social inequities (Balehey et al., 2018; Dressler et al., 2019).

Changes in water availability may arise because of decreased supply or increased competition from other sectors. Availability changes may be accompanied by shifts in water quality, such as increased levels of microorganisms and algae, that can negatively affect livestock health (Naqvi et al., 2015). In arid lands, projected decreases in water availability will severely compromise reproductive performance and productivity in sheep (Naqvi et al., 2017).

These adaptations include more effective matching of stocking rates with pasture or other feed production; adjusting herd and watering point management to altered seasonal and spatial patterns of forage production; managing diet quality, which also helps reduce enteric fermentation in ruminants and thus GHG emissions (using diet supplements, legumes, choice of introduced pasture species and pasture fertility management); more effective use of silage, rotational grazing or other forms of pasture spelling; fire management to control woody thickening; using better-adapted livestock breeds and species; restoration of degraded pastureland; migratory pastoralist activities; and a wide range of biosecurity activities to monitor and manage the spread of pests, weeds and diseases (Herrero et al., 2015; Godde et al., 2020).

Keeping two or more species of livestock simultaneously on the same farm can confer economic and sustainability benefits to European farmers (Martin et al., 2020). Some livestock producers are changing and diversifying management practices, improving access to water sources, increasing uptake of off-farm activities, trading short-term profits for longer-term resilience benefits and migrating out of the area (Hussain et al., 2016; Berhe et al., 2017; Merrey et al., 2018; Thornton et al., 2018 ; Espeland et al., 2020). Others are adopting more climate-resilient livestock species such as camels (Watson et al., 2016a), using climate forecasts at differing time scales, and benefitting from innovative livestock insurance schemes, though challenges remain in their use at scale (Dayamba et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2019a; Johnson et al., 2019)."

Livestock ownership or switching to smaller, local breeds does not automatically translate into positive nutrition outcomes for women and children, although it may if communities see such animals as suitable for husbandry by women (Chanamuto and Hall, 2015); the relationship is complex (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015; Dumas et al., 2018)."

wg2_ch05_box-5.5:-alternative-sources-of-protein-for-food-and-feed_p1,NO_TITLE,"Alternative protein sources for human food and livestock feed are receiving considerable attention. Laboratory or ‘clean meat’ is one potential contributor to the human demand for protein in the future (SRCLL). Such technology may be highly disruptive to existing value chains but could lead to significant reduction in land use for pastures and crop-based animal feeds (Burton, 2019; Rosenzweig et al., 2020). The impacts on GHG emissions depend on the meat being substituted and the trade-off between industrial energy consumption and agricultural land requirements (Mattick et al., 2015; Alexander et al., 2017; Rubio et al., 2020b; Santo et al., 2020). Livestock feeds can make use of other protein sources: insects are generally rich in protein and can be a significant source of vitamins and minerals. Black soldier fly, yellow mealworm and the common housefly have been identified for potential use in feed products in the EU, for example (Henchion et al., 2017). Replacing land-based crops in livestock diets with some proportion of insect-derived protein may reduce the GHG emissions associated with livestock production, though these and other potential effects have not yet been quantified (Parodi et al., 2018; Section 5.13.2). Other sources are high-protein woody plants such as paper mulberry (Du et al., 2021) and algae, including seaweed. While microalgae and cyanobacteria are mainly sold as a dietary supplement for human consumption, they are also used as a feed additive for livestock and aquaculture, being nutritionally comparable to vegetable proteins. The potential for cultivated seaweed as a feed supplement may be even greater: some red and green seaweeds are rich in highly digestible protein. Asparagopsis taxiformis, for example, also decreases methane production in both cattle and sheep when used as a feed supplement (Machado et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018b). Novel protein sources may have considerable potential for sustainably delivering protein for food and feed alike, though their nutritional, environmental, technological and socioeconomic impacts at scale need to be researched and evaluated further."
wg2_ch05_5.6_p1,NO_TITLE,"Forests play a vital role in the ecology of the planet, including climate regulation, and provide a range of important ecosystem services within their local landscape. Moreover, they are essential to the well-being of millions of people around the world. Forests are sources of food contributing about 0.6% of global food consumption and provide important products, such as timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (FAO, 2014). Indigenous Peoples and local communities are estimated to manage at least 17% of total carbon (or 293 × 109Mg) stored in forest in 64 assessed countries (RRI, 2018a). While small in number, numerous local communities around the world are highly or entirely dependent on forests for their food supply (Karttunen et al., 2017). An estimated 9% of the world’s rural population is lifted above the extreme poverty line because of income from forest resources (World Bank, 2016). Additionally, forest income plays a particularly important role in diversifying the income sources of poor households, reducing their vulnerability to loss from one source of income. This section covers an assessment of the impacts of climate change on forestry production systems and the adaptation options available. Non-timber forest products will be covered in the next section."
wg2_ch05_5.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The IPCC AR5 stated that there is high confidence that numerous plants and animal species have already migrated, changed their abundance, and shifted their seasonal activities as a result of climate change (Settele et al., 2014).

wg2_ch05_5.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The SRCCL (Barbosa et al., 2019) concluded that climate change will have positive and negative effects on forests, with varying regional and temporal patterns.

In contrast, negative impacts are already being observed in other regions such as increasing tree mortality due to wildfires."
wg2_ch05_5.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"In the past years, tree mortality continued to increase in many parts of the world. Large pulses of tree mortality were consistently linked to warmer and drier than average conditions for forests throughout the temperate and boreal biomes (high confidence) (Sommerfeld et al., 2018; Seidl et al., 2020). Long-term monitoring of tropical forests indicates that climate change has begun to increase tree mortality and alter regeneration (Hubau et al., 2020; Sullivan et al., 2020). Climate-related die back has also been observed due to novel interactions between the life cycles of trees and pest species (Kurz et al., 2008; Lesk et al., 2017; Sambaraju et al., 2019). A recent example of the impacts of climatic extremes is the European drought of 2018 (Buras et al., 2020), which led to a significant browning of the vegetation and resulted in widespread tree mortality (high confidence) (Brun et al., 2020; Schuldt et al., 2020). This brought markets for conifer timber close to collapse in parts of Europe, posing considerable challenges for timber-based forestry and leading to cascading impacts on society (Hlásny et al., 2021). Overall, there is robust evidence and medium agreement  that provisioning services of boreal and temperate forests are affected negatively by forest disturbances, while for cultural services only limited evidence with medium agreement  exists (Thom and Seidl, 2016)."

However, the observed patterns of post-disturbance recovery vary with region, with reduced tree regeneration reported for the western USA (Stevens-Rumann and Morgan, 2019; Turner et al., 2019) but robust recovery observed in Canada (White et al., 2017) and Central Europe (medium confidence) (Senf et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Also, the distribution and traits of trees are increasingly influenced by climate change, with impacts for local ecosystem service supply. In the USA, a study of 86 tree species/groups over the past three decades showed that more tree species have shifted westward (73%) than poleward (62%) in their abundance (Fei et al., 2017). This was due more to changes in moisture availability than to changes in temperature. As climate has warmed, trees are growing faster with longer growing seasons. However, a study of forests in Central Europe revealed that wood density has decreased since the 1870s (Pretzsch et al., 2018). This means that increasing tree growth might not directly translate to increased total biomass and carbon sequestration."
wg2_ch05_5.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"AR5 stated that other stressors such as human-driven land use change and pollution will continue to be the main causes of forest cover change in the next three decades (Settele et al., 2014). In the second half of this century, it was projected that climate change will be a strong stressor of change in forest ecosystems. Many forest species may not be able to move fast enough to adjust to new climate conditions. In some cases, a warmer climate could lead to extinction of species."

In general, a 2°C warming could lead to two times more area of biome shifts compared with a 1.5°C warming. As a result, keeping a cooler average global temperature will lead to lower extinction risks. The special report supports the AR5 conclusion that a warmer planet will impact wide swaths of forests adversely. For example, higher temperatures will promote fire, drought and insect disturbances. Consistent with AR5, SRCCL projected that tree mortality will increase with climate change (Barbosa et al., 2019). In addition, forests will be more exposed to extreme events such as extreme heat, droughts and storms. The incidence of forest fires will likewise increase."
wg2_ch05_5.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Additional evidence since the above reports were published supports their overall conclusions. For example, at the global scale, modelling the vulnerability of 387 forest ecoregions under future climate change (to 2080 using the average of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and RCP4.5 and 8.5) across different biomes, biogeographical realms and conservation statuses showed that 8.8% of global forest ecoregions are highly vulnerable in a low-greenhouse-gas-concentration scenario, and 32.6% of the global forest ecoregions are highly vulnerable in a high-greenhouse-gas-concentration scenario (Wang et al., 2019a). Furthermore, a recent synthesis of the literature suggests that climate change will result in younger and shorter forests globally (McDowell et al., 2020). In Asia, a systematic review of climate change impacts on tropical forests revealed that future climate may lead to changes in species distribution and forest structure and composition as well as phenology (Deb et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch05_5.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"Overall, studies indicate both negative and positive climate change impacts on forest production systems. Some forests in the USA could benefit slightly from CO2 fertilisation (using IGSM-CAM and MIROC3.2 till 2100) resulting in increased productivity especially for hardwoods (Beach et al., 2015). A study across Europe showed that both productivity gains (mostly in Northern and Central Europe, up to +33%) and losses (predominately in Southern Europe, up to −37%) are possible until the end of the 21st century (Reyer et al., 2017). The study further indicated that disturbances would reduce gains and exacerbate losses of productivity throughout Europe under climate change (Reyer et al., 2017). For Central and Eastern Canada, decreasing biomass production is projected as a result of increasing disturbance from wildfire and drought (Brecka et al., 2020). Climate-induced disturbances could also reduce the temporal stability of ecosystem service supply (Albrich et al., 2018), increasing the volatility of timber markets (medium confidence). More broadly, climate change could lead to abrupt changes and the crossing of tipping points, resulting in profoundly altered future forest development trajectories (Turner et al., 2020). Some studies suggest that such threshold could already be crossed at relatively low warming levels of +2°C (Elkin et al., 2013; Albrich et al., 2020), with substantial implications for ecosystem service supply (limited evidence, high agreement )."
wg2_ch05_5.6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Regional studies on the potential future effects of climate change on forest production systems indicate diverse impacts. In Germany, drier conditions in 2070 (RCP8.5; GCMs INM-CM4, ECHAM6 and ACCESS1.0) are expected to benefit the mean annual increment at biological rotation age of Scots pine and oak, while beech might suffer losses of up to 3 m 3 ha –1 yr –1 depending on climate scenario and region (Albert et al., 2018). In India, 46% of the forest grid points were found to have high, very high or extremely high vulnerability under future climate in the short term (2030s) under both RCP4.5 and 8.5, increasing to 49% and 54%, respectively, in the long term (2080s) (Sharma et al., 2017). In addition, forests in the higher rainfall zones show lower vulnerability as compared with drier forests under future climate, which is in contrast to dry forests in Central and South America cited above. Warming and drying trends are projected to reduce timber production in the neotropics in some cases (Hiltner et al., 2021). Also in India, a study using CMIP5 (RCP4.5 and 8.5 with two time slices 2021–2050 and 2070–2099) shows how forests in five districts in Himachal Pradesh in Western Himalayan region are vulnerable to global warming (Upgupta et al., 2015). In the Guiana Shield, climate projections under RCP2.5 and 8.5 led to decreasing the basal area, above-ground fresh biomass, quadratic diameter, tree growth and mortality rates of tropical forests (Aubry-Kientz et al., 2019). In Central Africa, projections under RCP4.5 and 8.5 showed a general increase in growth, mortality and recruitment leading to a strong natural thinning effect, with different magnitudes across species (Claeys et al., 2019)."

The results are very sensitive to the climate change scenarios tested, the climate and vegetation models used and the climate drivers that are considered. For example, Tian et al.

wg2_ch05_5.6.3_p2,5.6.3.1 Adaptation measures in sustainable forest management ,"A systematic review of literature revealed that successful adaptation in forest management can be achieved if there are partnerships between key stakeholders such as researchers, forest managers and local actors (Keenan, 2015). Such partnerships will lead to a shared understanding of climate-related challenges and more effective decisions. Forest managers in some countries of the world seem to have high awareness of climate change (van Gameren and Zaccai, 2015; Seidl et al., 2016; Sousa-Silva et al., 2016). However, they need more information on how they can adjust their practices in response to climate change. Institutional and policy context needs to be considered to facilitate adaptation by forest managers (Sousa-Silva et al., 2016; Andersson et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch05_5.6.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"A wide range of measures exist to adapt sustainably managed forests of the boreal and temperate zone to climate change (Kolström et al., 2011; Gauthier et al., 2014; Keenan, 2015). Evidence emerging since the last assessment report further bolstered the notion that adapting the tree species composition to more warm-tolerant and less disturbance-prone species can significantly mitigate climate change impacts (high confidence) (Duveneck and Scheller, 2015; Seidl et al., 2018). Assisting the establishment of species in suitable habitats is one option to achieve climate-adapted tree species compositions (Benito-Garzón and Fernández-Manjarrés, 2015; Iverson et al., 2019). Furthermore, increasing the diversity of tree species within stands can have positive effects on tree growth and reduce disturbance impacts (high confidence) (Neuner et al., 2015; Jactel et al., 2018; Ammer, 2019). Some studies also suggest a positive effect of increased structural diversity, such as on forest resilience (moderate confidence) (Lafond et al., 2013; Koontz et al., 2020). Managing for continuous forest cover can also help to maintain the forest microclimate and buffer tree regeneration and the forest floor community against climate change (high confidence) (De Frenne et al., 2013; Zellweger et al., 2020).

Indigenous communities in the Arctic perceive climate change related impacts on traditional wild foods, and availability and access to wild foods are forecast to continue to decline (Brinkman et al., 2016). Some communities hold positive views of the new opportunities a warmer climate will bring, seeing them as a favourable trade-off relative to the loss of some forms of subsistence hunting (Nuttall, 2009).

wg2_ch05_5.8.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is medium confidence that climate change will reduce global fisheries’ productivity (Section 3.4.4.2.3), with more significant reductions in tropical and subtropical regions and gains in the poleward areas (Bindoff et al., 2019; Oremus et al., 2020). Through an ensemble of marine ecosystem models and Earth System Models, mean global animal biomass in the ocean has been estimated to decrease by 5% under the RCP2.6 emissions scenario and 17% under RCP8.5 by 2100, with an average decline of 5% for every 1°C of warming (Lotze et al., 2019), affecting food provision, revenue distribution, and potentially hindering the rebuilding of depleted fish stocks (Britten et al., 2017). The projected declining rates result in a 5.3–7% estimated global decrease in marine fish catch potential by 2050 (Cheung et al., 2019), particularly accentuated in tropical marine ecosystems and affecting many low-income countries (Barange and Cochrane, 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter). Projections indicate that by 2060 the number of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) with new transboundary stocks will increase to 46 under strong mitigation RCP2.6, and up to 60 EEZs under the RCP8.5 GHG emissions scenario (Pinsky et al., 2018). Similarly, by combining six intercompared marine ecosystem models, Bryndum-Buchholz et al. (2019) projected that under the RCP8.5 scenario a total marine animal biomass decline of 15–30% would occur in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific and the Indian Ocean by 2100. In contrast, polar ocean basins would experience a 20–80% increase. In the eastern Bering Sea, simulations based on RCP8.5 predict declines of pollock (>70%) and cod (>35%) stocks by the end of the century (Holsman et al., 2020). Temperate tunas (albacore, Atlantic bluefin and southern bluefin) and the tropical bigeye tuna are expected to decline in the tropics and shift poleward by the end of the century under RCP8.5, while skipjack and yellowfin tunas are projected to increase abundance in tropical areas of the eastern Pacific but decrease in the equatorial western Pacific (medium confidence) (Erauskin-Extramiana et al., 2019). In the western and central Pacific, redistribution of tropical tuna due to climate change is projected to affect license revenues from purse seine fishing and shift more fishing into high seas areas (Bell et al., 2018; Table 15.5). For the east Atlantic, observational evidence indicates that not only will tuna distribution change with temperature anomalies, but also fishing effort distribution (Rubio et al., 2020a). There is medium confidence that climate change will create new fishing opportunities when exploited fish stocks shift their distribution into new fishing regions in enclosed seas, such as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea (Hidalgo et al., 2018; Pinsky et al., 2018). However, in general, where land barriers constrain the latitudinal shifts, the expected impacts of climate change are population declines and reduced productivity (high confidence) (Oxenford and Monnereau, 2018). Besides direct impacts on the abundance of fisheries-targeted species, climate-change-induced proliferation of invasive species could also affect fisheries’ productivity (low confidence) (Mellin et al., 2016; Goldsmith et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.8.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Shifting marine fisheries will affect national economies (high confidence) (Bindoff et al., 2019). It has been suggested that, without government subsides, fishing is already non-profitable in 54% of the international waters (Sala et al., 2018). Projections are that fishing maximum revenue potential from landed catches will decrease further by 10.4% (±4.2%) by 2050 relative to 2000 under RCP8.5, close to 35% greater than the decrease projected for the global maximum catch potential (7.7±4.4%); (Lam et al., 2016). The global revenue potential loss for that period ranges from USD 6 to 15 billion (depending on the model), but impacts may be amplified at the regional scale for fisheries-dependent and low-income countries. The maximum revenue potential percentage decrease in the EEZ under RCP8.5 is estimated to be over 2.3 times larger than that of the high seas (Lam et al., 2016). Ocean acidification is also expected to drive large global economic impacts (medium confidence) (Cooley et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2017; Macko et al., 2017; Hansel et al., 2020), and there is high confidence that the integrated economic consequences of all interacting climate change-related factors would result in even larger losses. Changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events will also alter marine ecosystems and productivity. Marine heatwaves can lead to severe and persistent impacts, from mass mortality of benthic communities to decline in fisheries catch (IPCC, 2021, Box 9.2). These events have very likely  doubled in frequency between 1982 and 2016 and have also become more intense and longer (Smale et al., 2019; Laufkotter et al., 2020); for all future scenarios Earth System Models project even more frequent, intense and longer-lasting marine heatwaves (Eyring et al., 2021; IPCC, 2021, Box 9.2)."

Climate warming may enhance northward colonisation of water bodies of commercial freshwater species in the Arctic, where there are few ecological competitors (medium confidence) (Campana et al., 2020) but at the same time may also accentuate the age-truncation effect of harvesting, elevating the population’s vulnerability to environmental perturbations (Smalås et al., 2019).

Specifically, overfishing is the most critical non-climatic driver affecting the sustainability of fisheries, and therefore improving management could help rebuild fish stocks, reduce ecosystem impacts and increase the adaptive capacity of fishing (high confidence); (Barange, 2019; Das et al., 2020). Pursuing sustainable fisheries practices under a low-emissions scenario would decrease risk by 63%; in contrast, under the most extreme RCP8.5, both profit and harvest decline relative to today even under the most optimistic assumptions about global fisheries management reforms (Gaines et al., 2018; Sumaila et al., 2019; Free et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch05_5.8.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"One adaptation strategy in the fishing sector is developing the capacity to recognise and respond to new opportunities that might arise from climate change by establishing a policy and planning setting that augments the fishers’ flexibility to change target species of fisheries or even engage in different productive activities. A key element would be the design and implementation of management schemes that consider flexible permits, sharing quotas, rethinking boundaries and reference points in response to system changes (Brander et al., 2018; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter). Large-scale distribution and productivity changes of commercial fish species will demand the ability to implement cooperative fishing strategies (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2020; Østhagen et al., 2020), and adjust multi-lateral treaties and other legal instruments used for managing shared transboundary ecosystems (Butler et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter)."

For example, spatial management that includes strategies such as Territorial Use Rights for Fishing (TURFs), locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) and customary tenure is an approach that has climate change adaptation potential in small-scale fisheries but will require adjustments in governing and managing institutions that allow them to be more dynamic and flexible (Le Cornu et al., 2018). In regions where some of these measures have already been tested, institutional, legal, financial and logistical barriers to successful adaptation have been encountered, such as market failures stemming from uncertainty around new or emerging species, or policy barriers derived from the fact that the creation of scientific information needed to change regulations is likely slower than the pace of changes in stocks (Peck and Pinnegar, 2018)."

For example, in West African fisheries, adaptation costs associated with replacing the loss of coastal ecosystems and productivity is estimated to require 5–10% of countries’ GDP (Zougmoré et al., 2016). For Pacific Islands and Coastal Territories, fisheries adaptation will require significant investment from local governments and the private sector (Rosegrant et al., 2016), and reducing dependence on or finding alternatives to vulnerable marine resources (Johnson et al., 2020; Mabe and Asase, 2020)."

Improving information flows allows for a more efficient co-management implementation (medium confidence) (Vasconcelos et al., 2020). Utilisation of local and Indigenous knowledge has the potential to facilitate adaptation (Bindoff et al., 2019), not only because it represents actual experiences and autonomous adaptations, but also because it facilitates reaching shared understanding among stakeholders and adoption of solutions. Challenges to hybridising local ecological knowledge and scientific knowledge include differences in stakeholder or governance perceptions about the validity of each knowledge set and issues of expertise and trust (Harrison et al., 2018). Engaging Indigenous Peoples and local communities as partners across climate research ensures this knowledge is utilised, enhancing the usefulness of assessments (Bindoff et al., 2019) and facilitating the co-construction and implementation of sustainable solutions (medium confidence) (Braga et al., 2020; Bulengela et al., 2020).

In some regions, organisations are already addressing this issue; for example, The Office of Water (OW) in the USA is aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe while ecosystem is conserved to provide healthy habitat for fish, plants and wildlife; however, success strongly depends on the possibility of integrating the jurisdictional framework of different agencies (Poesch et al., 2016), the implementation of effective monitoring programmes (Paukert et al., 2016) and finding ways to incentivise the early restoration of degraded systems (Ranjan, 2020)."

Observed indirect effects of climate change on aquaculture include extreme weather events that damage coastal aquaculture infrastructure or enable flooding, both leading to animal escapees (e.g., fish, shrimp), damaged livelihoods and interactions with wild species (high agreement , medium evidence) (Beveridge et al., 2018b; Dabbadie et al., 2018; Kais and Islam, 2018; Pongthanapanic et al., 2019; Ju et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch05_5.9.2_p1,5.9.2.1 Gender and other social vulnerability and roles in aquaculture ,"Aquaculture vulnerability assessments have shown that countries from both high and low latitudes are highly vulnerable to climate change, where vulnerability is driven by particular exposures, economic reliance, type of production sector (freshwater, brackish, marine) and adaptive capacity (high confidence) (Handisyde et al., 2017; Soto et al., 2018). Regional aquaculture vulnerabilities and risk mitigation potentials for the major FAO reporting regions are shown in Figure 5.14. Best practice guidelines for assessments exist (Brugère et al., 2019; FAO, 2020d), but in practice most only cover some climatic drivers (medium agreement , limited evidence) (Soto et al., 2018). Holistic vulnerability assessments include ecosystem services (Custódio et al., 2020; Gentry et al., 2020) and farming practices which can exacerbate production pressures (stocking densities, eutrophication, fish stress) (Soto et al., 2018; Sainz et al., 2019). Common vulnerabilities to inland and marine aquaculture include increasing incidence and toxicity of HABs related to warming waters, causing fish kills and product consumption risks, negatively impacting the productivity and stability of production sectors and reliant communities (high confidence) (Soto et al., 2018; Aoki et al., 2019; Bannister et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.9.2_p3,5.9.2.1 Gender and other social vulnerability and roles in aquaculture ,"There is high confidence that inland aquaculture in Southeast Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change, due to fluctuations in water resources either through climatic variability in precipitation, flooding or salinity inundation or through competition (Handisyde et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018; Soto et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2019b; Prakoso et al., 2020). Studies in Bangladesh and Indonesia highlighted regional and species-specific vulnerabilities (Prakoso et al., 2020) and roles of governance in vulnerability reduction (Islam et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch05_5.9.2_p4,5.9.2.1 Gender and other social vulnerability and roles in aquaculture ,"In the marine sector, vulnerability models (Brugère and De Young, 2015; Handisyde et al., 2017) have been adapted and applied to semi-quantitative spatial risk assessments for Chilean Atlantic salmon, where analysis of exposure threat coupled with mortality and temperature farm data could enhance salmon production (Soto et al., 2019). Vulnerability assessments in Korea (RCP8.5 temperature increase of 4–5°C by 2100) (Kim et al., 2019a) and the USA (ocean acidification, Barton et al., 2015; Ekstrom et al., 2015) found major exposure-related vulnerabilities for seaweeds and shellfish, with reduced vulnerabilities under higher production control and adaptive capacity. Global bivalve vulnerability assessments (RCP8.5 by 2100) show high vulnerabilities for major producing countries related to cyclones (China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Viet Nam and North Korea), regional risk of high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity (Chile, Peru, Spain, Italy), with few major producers (France, the Netherlands and USA) anticipated to remain moderately vulnerable by 2100 (Stewart-Sinclair et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch05_5.9.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"There are regional differences in women’s roles, responsibilities and involvement in adaptation strategies in the aquaculture sector.

Women employed in aquaculture cooperatives gained adaptive capacity, which reduced gender inequities (medium confidence) (Farquhar et al., 2018; Gonzal et al., 2019), but lack of financial access for women can create gender inequity at larger commercial scales (Gurung et al., 2016; Call and Sellers, 2019).

Precipitation and temperature changes will cause drought and flooding, negatively affecting near-shore fishpond productivity (limited evidence) (Canevari-Luzardo et al., 2019), but provide competitive advantages to non-native shrimp in Australia (limited evidence) (Cerato et al., 2019). Warming and acidification will increase HAB toxicity in freshwater systems, but responses may be strain-specific (Griffith and Gobler, 2020; Hennon and Dyhrman, 2020). As for molluscs in marine systems, projected climate change in freshwater and brackish systems may limit the availability of wild-sourced juveniles from fisheries (Beveridge et al., 2018).

wg2_ch05_5.9.4.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Aquaculture is often viewed as an adaptation option for fisheries declines, thereby alleviating food security from losses of other climate change impacts (Sowman and Raemaekers, 2018; Johnson et al., 2020) such as Pacific Islands freshwater aquaculture, Bangladesh crop-aquaculture systems or Viet Nam rice–fish cultivations (Soto et al., 2018). Many adaptations are specific to regions, countries or sectors, implemented on a regional to national scale (FAO, 2018c; Galappaththi et al., 2020b). Adaptation likelihood (potential), effectiveness and risk of maladaptation was assessed per major FAO production region for inland, brackish and marine aquaculture (Figure 5.16) production systems. Potential adaptation measures to reduce production loss can be built upon existing adaptation planning and guidelines, to reduce the risk of maladaptation including feedback loops (e.g., FAO, 2015; Bueno and Soto, 2017; Dabbadie et al., 2018; FAO, 2018c; Poulain et al., 2018; Brugère et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2021; Soto et al., 2021). Large climate change adaptation strategies for the aquaculture sector exist, such as in the USA (Link et al., 2015), Australia (Hobday et al., 2017) and South Africa (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2016). Lower-income countries often lack financial, technical or institutional capacity for adaptation planning (Galappaththi et al., 2020b), but examples include Bangladesh and Myanmar (FAO, 2018c), with programmes offering adaptation funding (Dabbadie et al., 2018).

Genomic resources are available for salmon, rainbow trout, coho, carp, tilapia, seabass, bream, turbot, flounder, catfish, yellow drum, scallops, oysters and shrimp, but have been developed for disease and growth selections rather than climate resistance (Dégremont et al., 2015a; Dégremont et al., 2015b; Abdelrahman et al., 2017; Gjedrem and Rye, 2018; Gutierrez et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018a; FAO, 2019d; Houston et al., 2020), although bivalve selections for ocean acidification and warming resiliency are underway (Tan and Zheng, 2020). Targeted genome editing could modify phenotypes of major aquaculture species (Li et al., 2014 a; Elaswad et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019; Houston et al., 2020), but uptake is dependent upon national regulatory and public approvals. Local adaptations within species with higher climate resiliencies may assist in selections (Thomsen et al., 2017; Falkenberg et al., 2019; Scanes et al., 2020; Toomey et al., 2020), but highlight the need to consider specific farming environments for selective processes (Houston et al., 2020).

However, while downscaled climate forecasts facilitate localised adaptation planning (Falconer et al., 2020a), such projections are rare (Whitney et al., 2020). GIS can be used for climate adaptive planning along with routine site assessments (Falconer et al., 2020b; Galappaththi et al., 2020b; Jayanthi et al., 2020).

Inshore aquaculture in low-lying areas prone to sea level salinity intrusion (e.g., Mekong delta and Viet Nam) have already implemented adaptation measures, such as conversion of land to mixed plant–animal systems (Nguyen et al., 2019a), conversion of freshwater ponds to brackish or saline aquaculture (Galappaththi et al., 2020b), building of dams and dykes (Renaud et al., 2015) and intensification of shrimp or fish pond culture to reduce water and land usage (Nguyen et al., 2019b; Johnson et al., 2020).

Companies provide insurance in major production areas, but aquaculture is considered high risk with large levels of small claims (Secretan et al., 2007). Insurance covers natural disasters and disease, helping to reduce and cope with climate-induced risk, enabling faster livelihood recoveries and preventing poverty (high agreement , limited evidence) (Xinhua et al., 2017; Kalikoski et al., 2018; Soto et al., 2018). For example, small-scale shrimp farmers were willing to pay higher premiums to manage risk, after participation in government pilot insurance schemes, ensuring greater pay-outs if a mortality event occurred (Nyguyen and Pongthanapanic, 2016; Pongthanapanic et al., 2019). Technological innovations are more widely implemented in larger operations, with Internet access promoting adoption at the farm site (Joffre et al., 2017; Salazar et al., 2018). Improved farm management is a key opportunity (high confidence) to reduce climate risks on aquaculture, where Best Management Practices can increase resiliency (Soto et al., 2018) and lower additional risk from non-climatic stressors (Gattuso et al., 2018; Smith and Bernard, 2020), and decision-tree frameworks can provide adaptation choices when events occur (Nguyen et al., 2016)."

Seasonal forecasting, downscaled models and early-warning systems provide valuable regional or farm site risk information (Hobday et al., 2018; Galappaththi et al., 2020b; Whitney et al., 2020), but monitoring will need to be useful for farmers, involve farmers, and be accurate, timely, cost-effective, reviewed and maintained in order to ensure uptake (high confidence) (Soto et al., 2018). Early-warning systems for HABs enable rapid decision making and risk mitigation (medium confidence), such as ocean colour monitoring in South Africa (Smith and Bernard, 2020), where early harvesting and additional husbandry were used to minimise production and economic losses (Pitcher et al., 2019). New tools, strategies and observations are needed to predict HAB occurrences and range shifts with changing climate (high confidence) (Schaefer et al., 2019; Tester et al., 2020), as there is uncertainty on drivers of incidence and toxicity (Wells et al., 2020)."

Indigenous groups differ in opinions on aquaculture acceptability, implications for coastal management and territorial rights (high confidence) (Young et al., 2019). Such perceptions may determine culturally appropriate types and benefits of aquaculture (employment, food diversification, income, building autonomy and skillsets), such as in Australia (Petheram et al., 2013) and Canada (Young and Liston, 2010). Marginalised people, like small-scale aquaculture farmers in lower-income and lower-middle-income countries, are often overlooked and are not represented at a governance level (Barange et al., 2014; Kalikoski et al., 2018). Therefore policy, economic, knowledge and other support must ensure representation with traditional and other stakeholder ecological knowledge at national, regional and local levels to facilitate climate change adaptation and safeguard human rights for poor and vulnerable groups (high confidence) (Kalikoski et al., 2018; Poulain et al., 2018)."

These systems produce about half of the world’s cereals, most of the fruits, vegetables, pulses, roots and tubers, and most of the staple crops and livestock products consumed by poor people in lower-income countries (Herrero et al., 2017). They can help in adapting to climatic risks and reducing GHG emissions by improving nutrient flows and improving the recycling of nutrients within the production system and by increasing food production and diet quality per unit of land and diversifying income sources (Smith et al., 2019c). Indigenous groups often practice mixed production, integrating crops, animals, fisheries, forestry and agroforestry through traditional ecological knowledge."
wg2_ch05_5.10_p2,NO_TITLE,"Some evidence exists of the buffering capacity that integrated systems can provide in the face of climate change (Gil et al., 2017). This buffering, often affecting the farming system as a whole rather than the individual agricultural enterprises involved, applies to some aquaculture–agriculture systems as well as to crop–livestock systems (Bunting et al., 2017; Stewart-Koster et al., 2017). In some situations, there may be trade-offs and constraints at the household level that affect this resilience-conferring ability: for instance, mixed systems often need relatively high levels of management skill, and extra labour may be required (van Keulen and Schiere, 2004; Thornton and Herrero, 2015). The diversification of food production systems offers promise for enhanced resilience at the global level (Kremen and Merenlender, 2018; Dainese et al., 2019; Section 5.4.4.4), though policies need to provide adequate incentives for resource efficiency, equity and environmental protection (Havet et al., 2014; Thornton and Herrero, 2014; Troell et al., 2014)."

The scale of the improvement varies between regions and systems and is moderated by overall demand in specific food products and the policy context. Integrated crop–livestock systems present opportunities for the control of weeds, pests and diseases. They can also provide a range of environmental benefits, such as increased soil carbon and soil water retention, increased biodiversity and reduced need for inorganic fertilizers (Havet et al., 2014; Thornton and Herrero, 2014; Herrero et al., 2015; Thornton and Herrero, 2015; HLPE, 2019)."

However, the  benefits of managing crop–livestock interactions in response to climate change depend on local context. For example, in higher-rainfall zones in Australia, Nie et al.

Many poorer households are having to rely on migration to compensate for shortfalls in crop production arising from a changing climate. Some farmers have successfully shifted to crop–livestock systems in Australia, where they have allocated land and forage resources in response to climate and price trends (Bell et al., 2014)."

The policy actions needed for the successful operation of mixed crop–livestock systems may be similar across widely different situations: good access to credit inputs and capacity building needed to facilitate uptake (Hassen et al., 2017; Marcos-Martinez et al., 2017), and good levels of market infrastructure (Ouédraogo et al., 2017; Iiyama et al., 2018)."

Failures in agricultural outputs due to climate-associated factors may result in diversification to fisheries as a way of alleviating food production shortfalls; for example, fisheries landings may dramatically increase after agricultural failures following hurricanes, which can subsequently create overfishing collapses (Cottrell et al., 2019). Where climatic impact drivers affect multiple sectors, adaptation may become more difficult because of the interacting challenges (Cottrell et al., 2019). One study of 12 countries with high food insecurity levels found that fish-reliant households utilised as much land as those not reliant on fish (Fisher et al., 2017). To meet food security requirements, most of these households needed to both farm and fish, illustrating the interdependence of aquatic–terrestrial food systems."

Many of these effects also reduce climate risk. At the same time, agroforestry systems are subject to impacts from climate change, potentially reducing the benefits they provide. Still, there is limited evidence of observed climate impacts on agroforestry systems, and modelling climate impacts is more complex for agroforestry than for single cropping systems (Luedeling et al., 2014)."

Nyamushamba (2017) reviewed the use of indigenous beef cattle breeds in smallholder mixed production systems in southern Africa.

A study of the Mapuche Indigenous group in Chile found that marginalisation and discrimination worsened their vulnerability and observed impacts of climate change because they had less access to services and lower incomes and were not as high a priority as other groups (Parraguez-Vergara et al., 2016). Among fisherfolk on Lake Wamala, Uganda, Musinguzi (2018) found evidence of considerable diversification to crop and livestock production as a means of increasing households’ food security and income, but women had greater workloads and less control over new income sources than men. Ngigi (2017) evaluated adaptation actions within households in rural Kenya and found that women tended to adopt adaptation strategies related to crops, and men to livestock and agroforestry activities. Chingala (2017) found substantial gender- and age-related differences in control of access to animal feed, animal health and water resources in beef producers in mixed crop–livestock systems in Malawi. In a review of agriculture–aquaculture systems in coastal Bangladesh, Hossain et al. (2018) showed that existing policies and adaptation mechanisms are not adequately addressing gender power imbalances, and women continue to be marginalised, leading to increasing feminisation of food insecurity. Such studies highlight the need to consider gender and other social inequities when examining adaptation in mixed production systems, particularly in situations in which men and women have different levels of control over productive assets (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18)."
wg2_ch05_5.10.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"The impacts of climate change on risk in mixed farming systems are projected to be dependent on market, ecosystem and policy context (medium evidence, low agreement ). In mixed crop–livestock farms in a semi-arid region of Zimbabwe, Descheemaeker (2018) found that feeding forages and grain could alleviate dry-season feed gaps to the 2050s, but their effectiveness depended on the household’s livestock stocking density. In comparing different commercial production systems, Tibesigwa (2017) found that, under South African conditions, climate change to the 2050s will reduce productivity across the agricultural sector, with the largest impacts occurring in specialised commercial crop farms owing to their relative lack of diversity. Mixed farming systems were the least vulnerable in terms of relative effects on farm output; this applied to commercial and subsistence sectors (Tibesigwa et al., 2017). Other studies suggest increased risk in mixed systems in semi-arid conditions. In northern Burkina Faso, Rigolot (2017) examined different crop fertilisation and animal supplementation levels under RCP8.5 to the 2050s. They found that, although aggregate profits could be increased via moderate levels of inputs, the use of external inputs may increase risk because of marginal costs exceeding marginal benefits in lower rainfall years. In the Western Australian wheat belt, Thamo (2017) assessed climate-change-induced shifts in farm profitability to the 2050s. For most options, the adverse effects on profitability were greater than the advantageous effects, profit margins being much more sensitive to climate change than production levels. However, in the same system, Ghahramani (2018) evaluated adaptation options to 2030 and found that a shift to a greater reliance on livestock could be profitable, even in years with low rainfall."

Impacts include increased temperature or water stress, an increase in pathogens affecting crops, changes to pollinator abundance, and changes in the nutrient content of one or more of the agroforestry components. Many tree products such as fruits and nuts are grown in agroforestry settings. The quality and nutrition of these products and other specialty crops are often negatively affected by rising temperatures, ambient CO2 concentrations and tropospheric ozone (Ahmed and Stepp, 2016). There is also evidence that the fungus coffee rust will be positively affected by climate change (Avelino et al., 2015; Bebber et al., 2016), with adverse effects on coffee agroforestry systems."

Comparing shade and full-sun coffee systems in Ghana, Abdulai (2018) concluded that the leguminous tree species providing shade and additional nitrogen led to soil water competition with the coffee trees during severe drought, resulting in enhanced coffee mortality. On the other hand, experimentally induced drought in a soybean-intercropping agroforestry system in eastern Canada led to crop losses in the monocropping system only, whereas N-fixation declined in both systems (Nasielski et al., 2015). Thus, balancing the synergies and trade-offs of multiple component systems is necessary based on local context. While species diversification can enhance resilience to climate shocks, lack of water can constrain the implementation of agroforestry practices in arid locations (Apuri et al., 2018)."

Twelve out of 17 high-income countries in Europe showed projected increases in agricultural production where adaptive capacity is higher, and agricultural and food fisheries’ dependence was lower. Some LMIC countries (Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and Gabon) showed relative reductions in both fisheries and agricultural production, where food insecurity, human population growth and fisheries overexploitation rates are high (Blanchard et al., 2017). Model projections under the RCP6.0 scenario show decrease in marine and terrestrial production to 2050 in 87 out of the 119 coastal countries studied, even though there is a wide variance in adaptive capacity and relative and combined dependencies on fisheries and agriculture (Blanchard et al., 2017). A projected 2050 move towards greater consumption of cultured seafood and less meat showed that aquaculture requires less feed crops and land, but was regionally dependent upon differing patterns of production, trade and feed composition (Froehlich et al., 2018b)."

Recently, there has been a partial recovery of annual rainfall amounts, more significant over the central than the western Sahel. This recovery is characterised by new rainfall features, including false starts and early cessation of rainy seasons, increased frequency of rainy days, increased precipitation intensity and more frequent and longer dry spells (Salack et al., 2015; Sanogo et al., 2015; Salack et al., 2016; Biasutti, 2019).

Traditional agroforestry has been practiced for millennia and provides prime examples of sustainable agroecological production systems meeting the production, income and socio-cultural needs of farming communities within their ecological niches, but market forces have often led to their demise (McNeely and Schroth, 2006; Plieninger and Schaar, 2008; García-Martínez et al., 2016; Krčmářová and Jeleček, 2016; Coq-Huelva et al., 2017; Paudel et al., 2017; Doddabasawa et al., 2018; Maezumi et al., 2018; Lincoln, 2020). The wide range of options to associate different trees with crops, livestock and aquaculture allows agroforestry to be practiced in most regions, including those with precipitation regimes ranging from semi-arid to humid. While most agroforestry systems occur in smallholder settings, there are examples of successful industrial-scale mechanised agroforestry systems (Feliciano et al., 2018; Lovell et al., 2018). Agroforestry delivers medium to large benefits to all five land challenges described in the SRCCL—climate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security—and is considered to have broad adaptation and moderate mitigation potential compared with other land challenges (Smith et al., 2019c). Agroforestry is also able to deliver multiple biophysical and socioeconomic benefits (Table 5.12)."

Several constraints need to be carefully addressed for successful scaling-up of agroforestry systems, including costs of establishment, limited short-term benefits, lack of reliable financial support to incentivise longer-term returns on investments, land tenure, knowledge of and experience with trees and the management of multiple component systems, and inadequate market access, (Coulibaly et al., 2017; Iiyama et al., 2017; Jacobi et al., 2017; Kongsager, 2017; Hernández-Morcillo et al., 2018; Iiyama et al., 2018; Lincoln, 2019). Kongsager (2017) and Roupsard et al. (2020) also highlight the need for vertical integration of measures from local to national scales to successfully address local barriers to adoption. Although there are few studies evaluating the long-term performance of agroforestry systems (Coe et al., 2014; Meijer et al., 2015; Brockington et al., 2016; Kongsager, 2017; Toth et al., 2017), the available results suggest that successful adoption of agroforestry practices depends strongly on the local enabling environment, including appropriate markets, technologies and delivery systems (medium evidence, high agreement )."

Weindl et al. (2015) assessed the implications of several climate projections on land use change to 2045 and found that shifts in livestock production towards mixed crop–livestock systems would represent a resource- and cost-efficient adaptation option, reducing global agricultural adaptation costs and abating deforestation by about 76 million ha globally. Both studies suggest that public policy support for transitioning livestock production systems to increase their efficiency could be an important lever for reducing adaptation costs and contributing to emissions reductions. This policy support could include modified regulatory and certification frameworks that incentivise livestock producers to adapt and mitigate (Weindl et al., 2015)."

The consequences of these system transitions have been mixed; in some cases, the household-level outcomes have been beneficial, while in others not. Policy environments, defined in terms of multi-level governance structures and institutions, are critical enablers of change. The vulnerability of many crop–livestock keepers to climate change is particularly affected by property and grazing rights (high confidence).

It includes domestic and international transportation, storage, processing, market infrastructure and institutions that make up value chains, as well as the food environment in which consumers make food purchasing decisions (HLPE, 2017a). Climate change impacts along the value chain alter availability, access and stability of food security. Nutrition-dense foods tend to be more perishable and are thus more vulnerable to limitations of food storage and transportation infrastructure (Ickowitz et al., 2019). Climate-change-related damage to food in storage (e.g., electricity failures and loss of cold storage) and transportation infrastructure (e.g., extreme weather events damaging roads and other infrastructure) could significantly decrease availability and increase the cost of highly perishable, nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish, meat and dairy."

Higher temperatures and humidity can increase post-harvest loss from pests and diseases, increase occurrence of food-borne diseases and contamination, and raise the cost of refrigeration and other forms of preservation. Extreme weather events can cause disruptions to food transport networks and storage infrastructure. Changes in regional weather can cause production centres to shift locations, potentially requiring changes in storage and processing locations.

As a product moves in the post-harvest chain to end users, post-harvest food loss from climate change can occur from improper handling to damage from microorganisms, insects, rodents or birds. Post-harvest losses in quality can be the result of stresses and damage to a plant or animal before harvest, including from climate change (Hodges et al., 2011; Medina et al., 2015a). Food  waste caused by climate change may occur at both retail units and homes because fresh ingredients and freshly prepared foods are vulnerable to quality reduction and spoilage from exposure to higher temperatures and humidity. Food waste also contributes to climate change by utilising resources that emit GHGs (Galford et al., 2020)."

Chocolate and coffee are notable among foods in that their carbon footprint ranges from negative to high, as these industries include both low-input agroforestry systems that have many co-benefits, and high-input monoculture systems where crops are grown without shade, in some cases on sites that have been deforested (Poore and Nemecek, 2019). While the coffee industry in many countries has already transitioned from agroforestry to full-sun production (Jha et al., 2014), the cocoa industry is at a turning point, with many growers deciding whether to move to the potentially more productive ‘full-sun system’, despite a general view that the agroforestry system is more resilient to climate change impacts (Rajab et al., 2016; Schroth et al., 2016; Farrell et al., 2018; Niether et al., 2020)."

For example, a comparison of Indonesian cocoa stands found that total carbon stocks above and below ground were five times higher in multi-shade agroforestry stands compared with monoculture stands (57 compared with 11 Mg C ha −1), and total NPP was twice as high (18 compared with 9 Mg C ha −1 yr −1). The extra carbon sequestration was achieved without any notable difference in cocoa yield (Rajab et al., 2016). At higher levels of shade, there can be negative impacts on the yield of the understory crop, but careful management of shade trees allows for both crops to thrive (Andreotti et al., 2018; Blaser et al., 2018; Niether et al., 2020)."

Shade trees insulate the understory crop from the warming and drying sun (Schroth et al., 2016). On the other hand, full-sun cocoa systems may be more climate resilient in some cases (Abdulai et al., 2018), as interactions between understory trees and shade trees are complex; in addition to shade effects, evapotranspiration and root interactions must be considered (Niether et al., 2017; Wartenberg et al., 2020). Moving to a full-sun system may also involve additional inputs in irrigation, fertilizer and labour. Neither (2020) reviewed the literature comparing the two cocoa production systems and concluded that the agroforestry system was superior in terms of climate adaptation."

Coffee and cocoa are often a main source of income for small-scale producers who are among the most vulnerable to climate hazards (Bacon et al., 2014; Schroth et al., 2016). Most of their produce is exported by large corporations and sold to relatively better-off consumers. In the context of climate justice, underlying structural inequities (socioeconomic, ethnicity, gender, caste), marginality and poverty help to shape the vulnerabilities of small-scale farmers to climate hazards (Beckford and Rhiney, 2016; Schreyer et al., 2018). Climate change may compound their vulnerability, if for example the loss of pollination services leads to a reduction in productivity (Avelino et al., 2015). Adaptation needs to consider the inequities associated with the commodity chain, and the adaptative capacity of producers as they seek to move into the more advanced processing stages of the commodity chain to realise higher returns from their exports (Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2015). Blue Mountain Coffee is a ‘specialty’ coffee associated with a protected area forest ecosystem that attracts a high price premium owing to its distinct flavour and aroma. The livelihoods of coffee farmers in this region are characterised by multiple socioeconomic, environmental and institutional stressors related to climate change, pests, plant diseases and production costs. Some coping strategies employed by these coffee farmers have increased their susceptibility to future climate impacts (Guido et al., 2019). Davis (2017) showed that these coffee farmers’ food security challenges could be alleviated by improved marketing of fruit tree products under shade coffee farming systems. Adaptation measures in such systems need to consider co-benefits and negative trade-offs, especially in vulnerable communities, to avoid widening further the inequities, rural livelihood loss, migration and marginalisation, and ensure progress towards the SDGs (high confidence)."

Most insects rely on pheromones to facilitate reproduction. Higher temperatures, but also increases in atmospheric CO2 and O3 levels, can affect this process. Insect species that rely on long-range chemical signals (such as ladybirds, aphids, bark beetles and fruit flies) will be most impacted, because these signals suffer from longer exposure to processes that reduce pheromone effectiveness (Medina et al., 2015b; Moses et al., 2015; Boullis et al., 2016; Verheecke-Vaessen et al., 2019)."

Finally, extreme events driven by climate change can disrupt transportation along the food value chain. Countries more at risk of natural hazards that disrupt transportation and distribution, and with less extensive routes, are more vulnerable to climate change impacts.

Specific examples of post-harvest technical adaptation options that are already available but could be more widely adopted include solar driers, cold storage facilities and transport and use of ultrasonic humidification of selected fruits and vegetables, a technology that has been shown in Europe to reduce losses in each post-harvest stage by 20% or more (Fabbri et al., 2018).

However, in hunger-affected export-oriented regions, partial trade integration might lead to increased exports at the expense of domestic food availability (Janssens et al., 2020).

Since most food-related decisions are made at a subconscious level (Marteau et al., 2012), achieving dietary change for personal health reasons has proven difficult; it seems unlikely that dietary change for climate will be achieved without careful attention to the factors that shape dietary choice and behaviour. Food environments, defined as ‘the physical, economic, political and socio-cultural context in which consumers engage with the food system to make their decisions about acquiring, preparing and consuming food’ (HLPE, 2017a): 28), include food availability, accessibility, price/ affordability, food characteristics, desirability, convenience and marketing."
wg2_ch05_5.12.6_p3,NO_TITLE,"There are a range of options to change dietary patterns, but more research is needed in this area, adjusted to the regional, socioeconomic and cultural context. Studies of policy instruments to change diets include changes in subsidies, taxes, marketing regulation and efforts to change the retail physical environment. Subsidies directed at staple foods and animal sourced foods could be shifted towards diversified production of plant-based foods in order to change the relative price of foods and, thus, dietary choice (Franck et al., 2013; Harris et al., 2021). Taxes on animal-sourced foods that are climate-costly and unhealthy, as defined by scientific panels such as the EAT-Lancet report, could similarly impact relative price (Mbow et al., 2019; Willett et al., 2019). Regulation of marketing could change desirability of climate-unfriendly and unhealthy foods (Willett et al., 2019). Many of the same strategies used to increase sales by conventional food marketing efforts hold potential to change the desirability and people’s preferences for plant foods which are strongly shaped by social–cultural norms. Studies have shown that changes to the number, placing or prevalence of vegetarian options on a menu (Bacon and Krpan, 2018; Kurz, 2018; Garnett et al., 2019; Gravert and Kurz, 2019), the relative price of vegetarian options (Garnett et al., 2021) and the ‘access’ (order and distance) to vegetarian options in the retail physical environment (Garnett et al., 2020) can all increase consumption of plant-based foods and decrease meat consumption (Bianchi et al., 2018). Studies on food environment ‘nudging’ methods found that making the vegetarian meal option the default during conference registration or on a meal plan significantly reduced meat consumption (Campbell-Arvai et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2019b). Studies simply educating people about the negative health and environmental/climate outcomes of meat consumption have been found to have very little impact (Byerly et al., 2018). More research is needed to understand the potential for motivational crowding in shaping pro-climate dietary choice, as has been demonstrated in development (Agrawal et al., 2015) and conservation interventions (Rode et al., 2015)."

Social protection programmes, such as cash transfers, weather index insurance and asset-building activities such as well construction, can support short-term responses to acute food insecurity in response to extreme events but can also build adaptive capacity longer term (Table 5.16, Costella et al., 2017; Ulrichs et al., 2019). An assessment of an adaptive social protection programme in the Sahel found that tailored seasonal forecasting can improve responsiveness to climate-related extreme events, but investment in capacity building and dialogue between forecasters, community groups and humanitarian organisations is needed (Daron et al., 2021). Forecast-based financing, which automatically disperses funds when threshold forecasts are reached for an extreme event (Coughlan de Perez et al., 2016), used in Bangladesh prior to a 2017 flood event allowed low-income, flood-prone communities to access better-quality food in the short term without accruing debt (Gros et al., 2019)."

Given identified linkages between higher temperatures and extreme events with declines in child dietary diversity, safeguarding diverse diets is one important adaptation priority (Niles et al., 2021). Humanitarian responses are appropriate for short-term acute hunger, while in the medium term, home-grown school feeding programmes with diverse foods can support child nutrition and learning, and with local procurement can also increase income and food security of smallholder farmers (Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021). Farmer associations can manage regional staple food storehouses, in which farmers store their harvest and receive credit, and can sell their harvest later in the season and pay back the credit with interest, strengthening local supplies and farmer income (Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021)."

A longitudinal study of smallholder coffee farmers in Nicaragua found that crop diversification, alongside crop management and varietal improvement, would help farmers strengthen food security long term in the face of climate hazards such as drought and coffee leaf rust (Bacon et al., 2021). Another medium- to long-term adaptation response is to address systemic gender, land tenure and other social inequities as part of an inclusive approach (Bezner Kerr et al., 2019; Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2020; Bacon et al., 2021).

Climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation approaches can also worsen inequities (Eastin, 2018; Borras et al., 2020). HRBA includes core principles of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, transparency, human rights, empowerment and rule of law, which can be integrated into policymaking and implementation as part of transforming the food system (FAO, 2013; Caron et al., 2018; Toussaint and Martínez Blanco, 2020). The right to well-being can serve as the overarching umbrella of HRBA to addressing climate change within food systems and includes a right to health, right to food, cultural rights, the rights of the child and the right to healthy environment (Swinburn et al., 2019). An HRBA has a specific focus on those groups who are vulnerable due to poverty, discrimination and historical inequities and involves meaningful participation of vulnerable groups in governance, design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies, including gender responsiveness and integration of Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge (UNHRC 2017; Caron et al., 2018; Mills, 2018). There can be conflicts and trade-offs, such as between addressing land rights or traditional fishing grounds, the right to food, and addressing climate justice concerns (Mills, 2018; Borras et al., 2020; Section 5.13). Adaptation strategies that incorporate HRBA include legislation, programmes that address gender inequities in agriculture, agroecology, recognition of rights to land, fishing areas and other natural resources, protection of culturally significant seeds, and community-based adaptation that explicitly involves marginalised groups in governance (Mills, 2018; Tramel, 2018; Huyer et al., 2019; Borras et al., 2020; Section 5.1 4)."

Since 2000, at least 160 million hectares have been under negotiation (Land Matrix, 2021). Land deals surged after the 2007–2008 food price crisis and farmland investment boom (Fairbairn, 2014), with a diverse range of drivers (Arezki et al., 2015; Zoomers and Otsuki, 2017; Conigliani et al., 2018) including land-based climate change interventions (Dunlap and Fairhead, 2014; Davis et al., 2015a; Hunsberger et al., 2017; Franco and Borras, 2019). Examples are the expansion of biofuel crops (e.g., Yengoh and Armah, 2016; Aha and Ayitey, 2017), afforestation and reforestation (A/R) projects (Olwig et al., 2016; Richards and Lyons, 2016; Scheidel and Work, 2018), REDD+ (Bayrak and Marafa, 2016; Ingalls et al., 2018), conservation areas (Lunstrum, 2016; Schleicher et al., 2019), renewable energy installations (e.g., Sovacool, 2021) or natural disaster management (e.g. Uson, 2017)."

Specific impacts of land deals vary according to their purpose, location, actors, land use history and procedural aspects. However, multi-case analyses identify severe adverse impacts (Table 5.18). LSLAs are a significant driver of tropical forest loss (Davis et al., 2020), increasing emissions through deforestation (Liao et al., 2021) and industrialisation of agriculture (Rosa et al., 2021). LSLAs entail large water appropriations (Breu et al., 2016; Chiarelli et al., 2016; Adams et al., 2019), affecting local populations’ access to water and food security (Dell’Angelo et al., 2018; Veldwisch et al., 2018). By increasing exported crops, and limiting local populations’ access to land, LSLAs produce food security risks (Marselis et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2021b). Negative livelihoods impacts arise through enclosure of assets, elite capture (Oberlack et al., 2016), crowding out of small farmers (Nolte and Ostermeier, 2017) and reducing local populations’ access to commons (Dell’Angelo et al., 2016; Giger et al., 2019). Indigenous People are affected, facing high levels of violence in land acquisition conflicts (Dell’Angelo et al., 2021). The social burdens of land deals tend to be gendered (e.g., Fonjong et al., 2016; Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner Kerr, 2017; Atuoye et al., 2021)."

Growing land tenure insecurity may force farmers to engage in unsustainable farming and forestry practices (Aha and Ayitey, 2017; Gabay and Alam, 2017) and hinder agroecological innovations to manage climate risks (Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2020b). Social justice concerns and vulnerability of local populations can be addressed by promoting land redistribution and recognition, particularly for customary lands of Indigenous and ethnic minorities, and land restitution to those who were forcibly displaced (Franco et al., 2015; Borras and Franco, 2018a)."
wg2_ch05_5.13.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Agricultural intensification seeks to increase agricultural productivity per input unit, reducing the pressure on land use and generating positive impacts in GHG emissions (Mbow et al., 2019), but valuing the final effect requires common metrics in terms of carbon capture or emission reductions (Searchinger et al., 2018). It has been suggested to address multiple SDGs (SDG2, SDG13, SDG15) but only occasionally leads to simultaneous positive ecosystem service and well-being outcomes (Rasmussen et al., 2018). When the process relies only on increasing input use, there is a risk of generating adverse outcomes that may override positive effects, such as CO2 emissions, (McGill et al., 2018), NOx emissions (Hickman et al., 2017), soil salinisation and groundwater depletion (Doody et al., 2015; Daliakopoulos et al., 2016; Fragaszy and Closas, 2016; Foster et al., 2018; Flörke et al., 2019).

Alternatively, ‘land sharing’ approach employs principles such as minimising fossil-fuel-based inputs, maximising synergies, and addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as biodiversity (Kremen and Miles, 2012; Kremen, 2015; Kremen and Merenlender, 2018; HLPE, 2019; Section 5.1 4, Box on Agroecology).

Use of wild fish meal and oil has been decreasing, partly due to concerns regarding vulnerable small pelagic fish stocks (Bindoff et al., 2019). The instability of wild fish stocks has increased terrestrial crop feed components (Troell et al., 2014; Blanchard et al., 2017; FAO, 2017; Cottrell et al., 2018). The use of wild fish in fish feeds that may have been directly consumed may put low-income households at risk of food insecurity (Troell et al., 2014). An increasing demand for aquaculture products intensifies competition for feed supplies (medium confidence) (Troell et al., 2014; Blanchard et al., 2017). Increases in demands for animal protein and shifts to pescatarian diets will increase the existing competition for land resources, particularly in low- and medium-income countries, with negative impacts on food security (Makkar, 2018), but may be mitigated by dietary changes, novel feeds and food waste usage for aquatic systems (Berners-Lee et al., 2018; Hua et al., 2019; Cottrell et al., 2020)."

Increases in feed prices will affect fish and meat prices (Troell et al., 2014), and changes in agriculture will be needed to satisfy aquaculture demands (Blanchard et al., 2017). Aquaculture and livestock dietary components may also compromise crops and forage fish that provide essential nutrients for low-income households increasing nutritional insecurity, in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America (Troell et al., 2014). Waste fish products can supplement fish meal and oil to reduce competition for feed, as well as reducing use of fish that could go to human consumption (medium confidence) (Little et al., 2016; Shepherd et al., 2017; Dave and Routray, 2018; Naylor et al., 2021).

A relatively new approach to agricultural insurance risk is the use of financial derivative products, such as index-based agricultural insurance (IBAI), marketed by financial institutions to farmers to help them deal with weather-related production risks (Isakson, 2015; Jensen and Barrett, 2017). The basic idea is to rely on easily observed weather indices, such as precipitation or temperature, that co-vary with farm production. Insurance payments are received when the metric trigger for a region is reached, eliminating the need to collect farm-specific information. Proponents of index insurance argue that it can resolve the information costs and incentive problems inherent in rural financial markets, such as adverse selection, and allow provision of insurance coverage at a fraction of the costs of loss-based polices (Jensen and Barrett, 2017). Buyers of index policies do not have to prove their ownership of assets with weather-related losses. This lowers transactions costs and makes it more affordable to insure small plots of land."

Some insurance providers bundle it with other services, such as fertilizer use or seeds that may not be useful to particular farmers and can increase their overall capital costs (Isakson, 2015). Although proponents see IBAI as a way to mitigate farmers’ risks associated with more variable weather patterns (Greatrex et al., 2015), critics argue that derivative-based insurance products tend to benefit wealthier farmers and fail in assisting the poorest and most marginalised farmers (Isakson, 2015; Taylor, 2016).

Negotiation among many stakeholders at multiple scales, including inclusive mechanisms to address power inequities in governance structures and communities, may be needed for CbA to be effective (Avtar et al., 2019; McNamara et al., 2020).

Low-performing initiatives, in contrast, were not sustained; these overlooked future climatic trends in their initiatives, such as beehive susceptibility to climate extremes, and had dependent, unequal relationships that lacked genuine local approval or ownership and did not fit local values and context (Spires et al., 2014; McNamara et al., 2020; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020). CbA initiatives can also suffer from not having adequate local knowledge of potential strategies to address future climatic scenarios, and may lead to maladaptation, increasing socioeconomic inequities in communities (Nagoda, 2015).

Evidence on strengthening local and regional food systems with a food sovereignty approach, in terms of access to resources (land, seeds, water), shortened food chains and CbA strategies suggest that these strategies can positively contribute to climate change adaptation in many contexts (medium confidence) (SRCCL) but can also lead to conflict especially regarding management of mobile resources such as fisheries (Section 5.8, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter). All these options can build adaptation through actions that strengthen local capacities and the power to act within food systems. Securing and recognising tenure for Indigenous Peoples (Hurlbert et al., 2019) and local communities (Oates et al., 2020) can improve their ability to adapt by increasing the incentive to invest in resilient infrastructure and sustainable land management practices. Community seed banks and networks strengthen local seed systems and realise farmers’ rights favouring access to a variety of local genetic resources, with landraces often more adapted to the local social, cultural and ecological environment and needs, and better adapted to harsh environments without external inputs (Mousseau, 2015; Bisht et al., 2018; Maharjan and Maharjan, 2018; Otieno et al., 2018; Mbow et al., 2019).

A relatively new approach to agricultural insurance risk is the use of financial derivative products, such as index-based agricultural insurance (IBAI), marketed by financial institutions to farmers to help them deal with weather-related production risks (Isakson, 2015; Jensen and Barrett, 2017). The basic idea is to rely on easily observed weather indices, such as precipitation or temperature, that co-vary with farm production. Insurance payments are received when the metric trigger for a region is reached, eliminating the need to collect farm-specific information. Proponents of index insurance argue that it can resolve the information costs and incentive problems inherent in rural financial markets, such as adverse selection, and allow provision of insurance coverage at a fraction of the costs of loss-based polices (Jensen and Barrett, 2017). Buyers of index policies do not have to prove their ownership of assets with weather-related losses. This lowers transactions costs and makes it more affordable to insure small plots of land."

Some insurance providers bundle it with other services, such as fertilizer use or seeds that may not be useful to particular farmers and can increase their overall capital costs (Isakson, 2015). Although proponents see IBAI as a way to mitigate farmers’ risks associated with more variable weather patterns (Greatrex et al., 2015), critics argue that derivative-based insurance products tend to benefit wealthier farmers and fail in assisting the poorest and most marginalised farmers (Isakson, 2015; Taylor, 2016).

Low-performing initiatives, in contrast, were not sustained; these overlooked future climatic trends in their initiatives, such as beehive susceptibility to climate extremes, and had dependent, unequal relationships that lacked genuine local approval or ownership and did not fit local values and context (Spires et al., 2014; McNamara et al., 2020; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020). CbA initiatives can also suffer from not having adequate local knowledge of potential strategies to address future climatic scenarios, and may lead to maladaptation, increasing socioeconomic inequities in communities (Nagoda, 2015).

wg2_ch05_5.14.2.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"Recent reviews have summarised literature on production system transformations, driven at least in part by a changing climate or changing climate variability. Such transformations may involve sometimes substantial shifts in farm and livelihood enterprises and land configurations, including intensification, diversification, sedentarisation and abandonment of agriculture (Vermeulen et al., 2018; Thornton et al., 2019). Relevant literature is summarised in Table 5.24, showing reported farmers’ perceptions of the drivers of change and the different outcomes of these changes. The consequences of these production system transitions have been mixed; in about 40% of cases, the outcomes at household level have been unequivocally beneficial. In the other cases, there were detrimental effects on livelihoods, or a mixture of positive and negative effects. The effects on nutritional security reported in these studies were limited. Different enablers of change appear critical if transitions are to have positive outcomes. Policy environments, defined in terms of multi-level governance structures and institutions, are a key driver of systems change, as well as being enablers of and barriers to adaptation responses (Xu et al., 2008; Namgay et al., 2014; Galvin et al., 2015; Schmidt and Pearson, 2016; Liao and Fei, 2017). Policies around property and grazing rights are directly linked to small-scale food producer vulnerability, and land ownership changes will pose a key challenge as climate change impacts in the marginal lands intensify (Reid et al., 2014). Collective action at multiple scales and effective governance structures are also a key enabler of transformational change, for helping community initiatives overcome economic, social and technical barriers, and to strengthen social capital and farmer knowledge (Haglund et al., 2011; Reed et al., 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2018; Fedele et al., 2019). Market development has been shown to be a critical factor for successful adaptation at scale in sub-Saharan Africa (Ouédraogo et al., 2017; Iiyama et al., 2018; Totin et al., 2018). At the same time, financing mechanisms may be a crucial enabler for different food system actors: de-risking agricultural production and food system investments for producers and input suppliers, for example, that address core market failures and compensate actors for extra short-term costs that can lead to longer-term benefits, particularly for small-scale producers and businesses with comparatively low access to technologies and services (Vermeulen et al., 2018; Millan, 2019; see Section 5.1 4.2.5)."

Over the entire tracked period, the three subsectors combined received a total of USD 29.82 billion for activities with principal and significant adaptation components. 4 However, the data set only includes climate-related development finance from bilateral, multilateral and private philanthropic sources, whereas private sector finance flows are not captured as this is notoriously difficult to track (UNEP, 2016; OECD, 2020; cross-ref to Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17). Most of the funding (85%) was directed towards agriculture, with forestry (12%) and fisheries (3%) receiving significantly less, but across the subsectors, there is consistency in the sense that policy and administrative management and development receive the lion’s share of support, which is predominantly given in the form of grants (72%), while debt instruments (26%) and equity and shares in collective investment vehicles (2%) contribute less. From a regional perspective, 80% were directed to Africa (47%), Asia-Pacific (27%), and Latin America and Caribbean States (7%), whereas Eastern Europe and Western Europe and Other States received (2%) each and 17% were destined for ‘developing countries’ without regional tags. Finally, it is noteworthy that 38% of adaptation finance in agriculture, forestry and fisheries is marked as also having mitigation benefits, and roughly a quarter of funding is reported as having principal or significant gender objectives."
wg2_ch05_5.14.2.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Whether current levels of growth in adaptation finance for agriculture, forestry and fisheries is keeping up with estimated needs cannot be assessed because of the large uncertainties that surround adaptation cost estimates (Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17). There is, hence, high agreement that better assessment of adaptation costs of climate impacts requires considerably more research (Watkiss, 2015; Diaz and Moore, 2017). A recent study focusing on investments needed to offset the effects of climate change on the prevalence of hunger concludes that investments in agricultural research and development (R&D) have to increase from USD 1.62 billion to USD 2.77 billion per year between 2015 and 2050 (Sulser et al., 2021a). In addition to agricultural R&D, significant investment increases in water and infrastructure in the range of USD 12.7 billion and USD 10.8 billion are required, respectively, a considerable portion of which is relevant to the food system. In total, Sulser et al. (2021a) estimate that annual investment between USD 21.47 billion and USD 29.8 billion are needed to avoid sliding back from climate-change-related increases in the prevalence of hunger but recognise the shortcomings of their approach and acknowledge that ‘a full analysis of adaptation to climate change in agriculture would require including many other social, economic, and environmental dimensions’. For comparison, World Bank (2010) estimated global costs of USD 70–100 billion per year for agriculture, forestry and fisheries, infrastructure, water resources, health, ecosystem services, coastal zones and extreme weather events to adapt to an approximately 2°C warmer world between 2010 and 2050. While the World Bank includes more sectors, more recent publications consider the resulting figures to be significantly too low (Baarsch et al., 2015; UNEP, 2016; Rossi and Miola, 2017; Hallegatte et al., 2018; Markandya and González-Eguino, 2019; Chapagain et al., 2020; WGII Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17). Therefore, despite the methodological and data challenges, further efforts are needed to better capture the economic risks of climate change and provide estimates of adaptation costs at global to national scales as well as across sectors (Watkiss, 2015; Diaz and Moore, 2017)."

Immature information systems (e.g., weak analytics, fragmented standards) (Woodard et al., 2019; Negra et al., 2020) inhibit effective due diligence and impact assessment, contributing to uncertainty and low investor confidence (Havemann et al., 2020; NGFS, 2020).

Tenant producers may not experience benefits from adaptation investments (Woodard et al., 2019). Investors seek low-risk, liquid investments and credit-worthy counterparties (Havemann et al., 2020), yet small- and medium-sized producers and supply chain actors often lack access to formal credit. Given limited experience and weak information for adaptation finance, sub-optimal outcomes may include imbalanced allocation of public and private finance (e.g., to less vulnerable regions and producers; to lower-resilience investments; to short-term benefits) as well as inequitable division of risks and returns (e.g., within blended finance structures) (Clapp, 2017; World Bank, 2018; Attridge and Engen, 2019).

The effective implementation of climate-smart practices is conceptually linked to an enabling environment in which policies, institutions and finance can re-orient agricultural systems, thereby supporting development and enhancing food security in a changing climate (Lipper et al., 2014; Karttunen et al., 2017). However, the concept has received criticism based on the absence of conceptual clarity of the interrelations between productivity, food security, adaptation and mitigation (Arenas-Sanchez et al., 2019) and because of limited evidence on the efficacy of CSA for achieving adaptation and mitigation outcomes at a global scale (Arslan et al., 2015; Lamanna et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2018). Some argue that CSA operates within an apolitical framework that tends to minimise issues concerning power, inequity and access, and is overly focused on technical approaches (Taylor, 2017; HLPE, 2019). CSA is explicitly referenced by more than 30 countries in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) (Ross et al., 2016), but measuring the degree of its implementation still represents a challenge."

Nevertheless, these advantages can be unequally realised given male domination in receiving information and extension services, as well as financial or resource access (Jost et al., 2016). Some (Huyer and Partey, 2020) argue that CSA may undermine gender equity (Collins, 2018), entrench and solidify power (Haapala, 2018), and result in the disproportional allocation of new labour-intensive activities to women (Jost et al., 2016). Uptake of some climate-smart technologies can further marginalise the most disadvantaged local groups (Roncoli et al., 2009; Haapala, 2018).

Food systems are the largest source of employment for young people, but do not always provide adequate livelihoods or decent working conditions (HLPE, 2021). Regions with more youthful populations—such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America—are both highly vulnerable to climate change impacts and reliant on agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and fisheries for livelihoods (Brooks et al., 2019; IFAD, 2019; HLPE, 2021). Rural youth in these sectors are particularly vulnerable, often with less access to land, water, capital and other resources, shaped by family and social relations, and fewer opportunities (high confidence) (Chingala et al., 2017; Ricker-Gilbert and Chamberlin, 2018; IFAD, 2019; Yeboah et al., 2020; Flynn and Sumberg, 2021; Nhat Lam Duyen, 2021).

Agrifood policy implementation of adaptation strategies could increase inclusive participation of youth to meet their needs (HLPE, 2021). Inclusive investments in water management, infrastructure, agrifood science, and policies that increase youth access to land, credit, knowledge, education, skills and other crucial resources can support dignified and rewarding agrifood employment (Ahsan and Mitra, 2016; Brooks et al., 2019; HLPE, 2021). Digital technologies can support agrifood adaptations, but digital divides must be overcome to avoid worsening inequities (HLPE, 2021). Initiatives which protect and strengthen youth engagement and employment in the all points of the food system, including recognition of youth’s critical role and agency through rights-based approaches, can support sustainable food transitions (HLPE, 2021).

CRDPs mentioned in SROCC include shifting from providing coastal defences to adapting to seawater inundation in coastal regions (Renaud et al., 2015) and retreating coastal megacities (Solecki et al., 2017). Pathway frameworks continue to be used to frame the broad-scale challenges of development and climate change, thereby linking different types of food system actor with different responses through time using a variety of approaches, top-down and participatory, qualitative and quantitative (Butler et al., 2016; Antle et al., 2017; Thornton and Comberti, 2017; Collste et al., 2019; Loboguerrero et al., 2020; Stringer et al., 2020)."

Management approaches seldom integrate across spatio-temporal scales and may be unable to address unidirectional change and extreme events (Holsman et al., 2019). The socioeconomic complexities and implications of pursuing integrated outcomes make it difficult to evaluate synergies and trade-offs associated with different actions in local contexts through time (Thornton and Comberti, 2017; Ellis and Tschakert, 2019; Holsman et al., 2019; Orchard, 2019). Case studies by Lo (2019) of transformation in a fishing town in south China and by Gajjar (2019) on undesirable path dependencies in development trajectories in urban and rural India show that overall adaptive capacity of populations may be decreased though politicisation and entrenchment of existing inequities, severely limiting the possibilities for future adaptation. A further challenge of implementation is timely detection of tipping points and abrupt exposure events in both climate and environmental systems (Lenton et al., 2019; Trisos et al., 2020), which may alter the efficacy of current and planned adaptation actions, necessitating a switch to other, more transformational strategies; in such cases, re-energising food system actors’ commitment to adaptation action may well be needed (Bloemen et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch05_5.14.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Integrated modelling of CRDPs will increasingly be needed to throw light on key SDG synergies and trade-offs into the future (Bleischwitz et al., 2018). In investigating possible future pressures on land under the SSPs, Doelman (2018) projected that the largest changes take place in sub-Saharan Africa in SSP3 and SSP4, mostly because of continued high population growth coupled with (projected) sluggish increases in agricultural efficiency, among other things, leading to expansion of agricultural land for crop and livestock production and reduced food security. Lassaletta (2019) evaluated global pig production in the SSPs and concluded that the future sustainability of pig systems will depend on production efficiency improvements coupled with other factors such as use of alternative feed sources and use of slurries on cropland. Such studies will be increasingly important for quantifying the potential trade-offs and synergies between different SDGs, to guide adaptation (and mitigation) action along CRDPs in the future. The current lack of widely accepted and simple-to-measure indicators for tracking progress in adaptation is a significant hurdle to overcome. There is a large literature on the desirable characteristics of future global food systems, but much less on robust analysis that explicitly addresses and evaluates the pathways towards these desired futures. Gerten (2020) estimates that 10.2 billion people can be supported within key planetary boundaries via spatially redistributed cropland and dietary changes, among other actions. There are few, if any, analyses for detailing the plausible pathways to move towards such a future in ways that are socially, economically and environmentally acceptable through time; whether such pathways could indeed be made climate-resilient is unknown. Appropriate monitoring and rapid feedback to food system actors on what is working and why will be critical to the successful operationalisation of adaptation actions within CRDPs (Bosomworth and Gaillard, 2019)."
