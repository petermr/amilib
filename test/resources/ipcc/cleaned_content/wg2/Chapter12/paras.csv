wg2_ch12_12.1.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Central and South America (CSA) is a highly diverse region, both culturally and biologically. It has one of the highest levels of biodiversity on the planet (Hoorn et al., 2010; Zador et al., 2015; IPBES, 2018a) (Cross-Chapter Paper [CCP] 1: Biodiversity Hotspots) and a wealth of cultural diversity resulting from more than 800 Indigenous Peoples who share the territory with European and African descendants and more recent Asian migrants (CEPAL, 2014). Moreover, it is one of the most urbanised regions in the world, with some of the most populated metropolitan areas (UNDESA, 2019). Several countries in the region have experienced sustained economic growth in recent decades, making important advances in reducing poverty in the area. Yet it is a region of substantial social inequality including the highest inequality in land tenure, where a large percentage of the population remains below the poverty line, unequally distributed between rural and urban areas and along aspects like gender and race; these groups are highly vulnerable to climate change and natural extreme events that frequently affect the region (high confidence) (ECLAC, 2019b; Busso and Messina, 2020; Poveda et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch12_12.1.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Land use changes in the region, particularly deforestation, are significant, mostly due to agricultural production for export purposes, one of the main sources of income for the area (Salazar et al., 2016) (Figure 12.2c). Additional pressure on the land comes from illegal activities, pollution and induced fires. These changes exacerbate the impacts of climate change and make the region a key player in the future of the world economy and food production (IPBES, 2018a). The region boasts the largest tropical forest on the planet and other important biomes of high biodiversity on mountains, lowlands and coastal areas. It can potentially continue its agricultural expansion and development at the expense of substantially reducing the areas of natural biomes. Indigenous Peoples and smallholder families are lacking adequate climate policies combined with institutions to protect their property rights; this could result in a more sustainable process of agricultural expansion, without substantially increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the vulnerability of those populations (high confidence) (Sá et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.1.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"CSA is divided into eight climatic sub-regions by Working Group (WG) I (Figure 12.1). Though the southern part of Mexico is included in the climatic sub-region South Central America (SCA) for WGI, Mexico is assessed in Chapter 14 (North America). In this chapter, we refer to this sub-region as CA because it excludes southern Mexico. The climate-change literature for the region occasionally includes Mexico, and in those cases, our assessment makes reference to Latin America but when only southern Mexico is included, the term Mesoamerica is used. Figure 12.2 and Table SM12.1 summarise relevant characteristics of the sub-regions included in this chapter."
wg2_ch12_12.1.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"The chapter is divided into two main sections. The first section follows an integrative approach in which hazards, exposure, vulnerability, impacts and risks are discussed following the eight climatically homogeneous sub-regions described in WGI AR6 (Figure 12.1). The second section assesses the implemented and proposed adaptation practices by sector; in doing so, it connects to the WGII AR6 cross-chapter themes. The storyline is then a description of the hazards, exposure, vulnerability and impacts providing as much detail as is available in the literature at the sub-regional level, followed by the identification of risks as a result of the interaction of those aspects. This integrated sub-regional approach ensures a balance in the text, particularly for countries that are usually underrepresented in the literature but that show a high level of vulnerability and impacts, such as those observed in CA. The sectoral assessment of adaptation that follows is useful for policymakers and implementers, usually focused and organised by sectors, government ministries or secretaries that can easily locate the relevant adaptation information for their particular sector. To ensure coherence in the chapter, a summary of the assessed adaptation options by key risks is presented, followed by a feasibility assessment for some relevant adaptation options. The chapter closes with case studies and a discussion of the knowledge gaps evidenced in the process of the assessment."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"CSA shows increasing trends of climatic change and variability and extreme events severely impacting the region, exacerbating problems of rampant and persistent poverty, precarious health systems and water and sanitation services, malnutrition and pollution. Inadequate governance and lack of participation escalates the vulnerability and risk to climate variability and change in the region (high confidence) (WGII AR5 Chapter 27) (Magrin et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Increasing trends in precipitation had been observed in SES (Figure 12.1), in contrast to decreasing trends in CA and central-southern Chile (high confidence) (WGII AR5 Chapter 27) (Magrin et al., 2014). The frequency and intensity of droughts have increased in many parts of SA (IPCC, 2019c). Warming has been detected throughout CSA, except for a cooling trend reported for the ocean off the Chilean coast."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Climate projections indicate increases in temperature for the entire region by 2100 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, but rainfall changes will vary geographically, with a notable reduction of −22% in northeastern Brazil and an increase of +25% in SES. Significant dependency on rainfed agriculture (>30% in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) indicates high sensitivity to climatic variability and change and represents a challenge for food security (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Undernutrition has worsened since 2014 in CSA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Evidence of climate-change impacts on food security is emerging from IKLK studies in SA. Municipalities in CA with a high proportion of subsistence crops tend to have fewer resources for adaptation and more vulnerable to climate change (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019). Rising temperature and decreased rainfall could reduce agricultural productivity by 2030, threatening the food security of the poorest populations (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Though reduced suitability and yield for beans, coffee, maize, plantain and rice are expected in CA (SRCCL Chapter 5, Mbow et al., 2019), limiting the warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, are projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat and other cereal crops for CSA (high confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The heat stress is expected to reduce the suitability of Arabica coffee in Mesoamerica, but it can improve in high-latitude areas in SA (SRCCL Chapter 4, Olsson et al., 2019). There is limited evidence that these declines in crop yields may result in significant population displacement from the tropics to the sub-tropics (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"There is a high confidence that heatwaves will increase in frequency, intensity and duration, becoming, under high emission scenarios, extremely long, over 60 d in duration in SA; the risk of wildfires will also increase significantly in SA (SRCCL Chapter 2, Jia et al., 2019). These processes are leading and will continue to lead to increased desertification that will cost between 8% and 14% of gross agricultural product in many CSA countries (SRCCL Chapter 3, Mirzabaev et al., 2019). Distinguishing climate-induced changes from land use changes is challenging, but 5–6% of biomes in SA are expected to change by 2100 due to climate change (SRCCL Chapter 4, Olsson et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Changes in weather and climatic patterns are negatively affecting human health in CSA, in part through the emergence of diseases in previously non-endemic areas (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Projections of potential impacts of climate change on malaria confirm that weather and climate are among the drivers of geographic range, intensity of transmission, and seasonality; the changes of risk become more complex with additional warming (very high confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). There is high confidence that constraining the warming to 1.5°C would reduce risks for unique and threatened ecosystems safeguarding the services they provide for livelihoods and sustainable development (food, water) in CA and Amazon (SR15 Chapter 5, Roy et al., 2018)."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Observed changes in streamflow and water availability affect vulnerable regions (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014). Glacier mass changes in the Andes in recent decades are among the most negative ones worldwide (SROCC Chapter 2, Hock et al., 2019). This reduction has modified the frequency, magnitude and location of related natural hazards, while the exposure of people and infrastructure has increased because of growing population, tourism and economic development (high confidence) (SROCC Chapter 2, Hock et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"The negative impacts of climate change in the region are exacerbated by deforestation and land degradation attributed mainly to expansion and intensification of agriculture and cattle ranching, usually under insecure-tenure land. This conversion of natural ecosystems is the main cause of biodiversity and ecosystem loss and is an important source of GHG emissions (high confidence) (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014)."
wg2_ch12_12.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"The combination of continued anthropogenic disturbance, particularly deforestation, with global warming may result in dieback of forest in the region (medium confidence) (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Losses of biomass as high as 40% are projected in CA with a warming of 3°C–4°C, and the Amazon may experience a significant dieback at similar warming levels (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Advances in second-generation bioethanol from sugarcane and other feedstock will be important for mitigation. However, agricultural expansion results in large conversions in tropical dry woodlands and savannahs in SA (Brazilian Cerrado, Caatinga and Chaco) (high confidence) (SRCCL Chapter 1, Arneth et al., 2019). The expansion of soybean plantations in the Amazonian state of Mato Grosso in Brazil reached 16.8% yr −1 from 2000 to 2005; and oil palm, a significant biofuel crop, is also linked to recent deforestation in tropical CA (Costa Rica and Honduras) and SA (Colombia and Ecuador), although lower in magnitude compared to deforestation from soybean and cattle ranching (WGII AR5 Chapter 27, Magrin et al., 2014)."

Spatially variable trends have been detected for the MSD timing, the amount of rainy-season precipitation, the number of consecutive and total dry days and extreme wet events at the local scale since the 1980s. At the regional scale, a positive trend in the duration, but not the magnitude, of the MSD was found (Anderson et al., 2019)."

Except in Belize and Panama, the majority of the countries’ populations—ranging from 56% in Honduras to 95% in El Salvador—were exposed to two or more risks derived from natural extreme events, affecting between 57% and 96% of the GDP of the countries (UNISDR and CEPREDENAC, 2014). CA is one of the regions most exposed to climatic phenomena; with long coastlines and lowland areas, the region is repeatedly affected by drought, intense rains, cyclones and ENSO events (high confidence) (ECLAC et al., 2015)."

Rural poverty rates are higher—82% in Honduras and 77% in Guatemala in 2014—as is poverty among Indigenous Peoples, up to 79% in Guatemala. Rural poor are the most sensitive to climate extremes as their main economic activity is based on agriculture in vulnerable terrains (NU CEPAL, 2018). In 2014, all CA countries, except for El Salvador (excluding Belize), had higher GINI coefficients (more inequality) than the average for Latin America (0.473), which in itself is the most unequal region in the world (ECLAC, 2019b); in 2018 the situation remained similar, with El Salvador showing the lowest GINI coefficient (40) and the remaining countries showing values higher than the Latin American average (BCIE, 2020)."

Hydro-meteorological events, such as storm surges and TCs, are the most frequent extreme events and have the highest impact (high confidence) (Reyer et al., 2017). From 2005 to 2014, the cumulative impacts were over 3410 people dead, hundreds of thousands displaced and damages estimated around USD 5.8 billion (Ishizawa and Miranda, 2016). One standard deviation in the intensity of a hurricane windstorm leads to a decrease in both the growth of total GDP per capita (0.9% to 1.6%) and total income and labour income by 3%, whereas it increases moderate and extreme poverty by 1.5% in CA (Ishizawa and Miranda, 2016)."
wg2_ch12_12.3.1.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Food insecurity is a serious impact of climate change in a region where 10% of the GDP depends on agriculture, livestock and fisheries (very high confidence) (ECLAC et al., 2015; CEPAL et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2018; BCIE, 2020). Crop losses largely result from highly variable rainfall and seasonal droughts, which have increased significantly in recent decades (Table 12.3) (CEPAL and CAC-SICA, 2020), particularly the observed changes in the MSD that reduces rainfall at the onset of the rainy season (May–June) (Anderson et al., 2019). Small and subsistence farmers experience the highest impact because they practice rainfed agriculture (Imbach et al., 2017), along with poor neighbourhoods, which face socioeconomic and physical barriers for adapting to climate change (Kongsager, 2017). In 2015, precipitation diminished between 50% and 70% of its historic average, causing a loss of up to 80% of beans and 60% of maize, leaving 2.5 million people food insecure, 1.6 million of whom were in the Dry Corridor of CA (ECLAC et al., 2015; FAO, 2016a). In 2019, the region entered its fifth consecutive drought year, with 1.4 million people in need of food aid. Seasonal-scale droughts are projected to lengthen by 12–30%, intensify by 17–42% and increase in frequency by 21–42% in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios by the end of the century (Depsky and Pons, 2021)."

In Honduras, rainfall and relative humidity were positively correlated with the occurrence of haemorrhagic dengue cases (Zambrano et al., 2012). In Costa Rica, temperature and rainfall were correlated to cattle rabies outbreaks and mortality during 1985–2016 (Hutter et al., 2018); incidence of leishmaniasis showed cycles of 3 years related to temperature changes (Chaves and Pascual, 2006); and snakebites were more likely to occur at high temperatures and were significantly reduced after the rainy season for the period 2005–2013 (Chaves et al., 2015). In Panama, rainfall was associated with an increased number of malaria cases among the Gunas, an Indigenous People with high vulnerability living in poverty conditions on small islands affected by SLR (Hurtado et al., 2018). These correlations point to a possible change in disease incidence with climate change; evidence of that change is yet to be reported in the literature because longitudinal studies are lacking in the region."

The Species Distribution Model, using the IPSL GCM, projects that the suitable zones for cacao and coffee will shrink between 25% and 75% under RCP6.0 (Fernandez-Manjarrés, 2018; Fernández Kolb et al., 2019). Warmer and dryer lower areas will become unsuitable for coffee and will drive its production to higher land (Läderach et al., 2013; Bunn et al., 2015).

In the case of Venezuela, the impact of climate change on the epidemiology of malaria has been studied, showing significant influence on transmission in the Amazonia area of the country (Figure 12.4) (Laguna et al., 2017). Other studies from Venezuela have documented the role of ENSO in dengue outbreaks (Vincenti-Gonzalez et al., 2018). Table 12.1 shows the changes observed in reproduction potential for dengue in the different sub-regions due to changes in rainfall and temperature. Forest fires pose a major threat to public health in the region because they relate to an increase in hospital admissions due to respiratory problems, mainly among children and the elderly (Figure 12.5).

Feedbacks to the climate system resulting from such land use changes are intricate. The clear-cutting of Amazon forest and Cerrado savannah in the region led to a local warming due to an increase in the energy balance and evapotranspiration (Malhado et al., 2010); in contrast, the replacement of pasture by agriculture have led to a local cooling effect, due to changes in the surface albedo (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ).

Recently, da Silva Junior et al. (2020) reported 6,708,350 and 6,188,606 fire foci in Cerrado and Amazonia, between 1999 and 2018, corresponding to 80% of the total observed in Brazil. The occurrence of extreme droughts has affected the carbon and water cycles in large areas of the Amazon rainforest (high confidence) (Lapola et al., 2014; Agudelo et al., 2019), in particular in its southern and eastern portions, where deforestation rates are higher. The loss of carbon in the Amazon region considering the combined effect of land use change in the southern portion of the region bordering Cerrado and Pantanal and global carbon emission scenarios can be as high as 38% at 4°C of warming, but limited to 8% if the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C is achieved (medium confidence, medium evidence, high agreement ) (Burton et al., 2021), driving the region to be a net carbon source to the atmosphere (Gatti et al., 2021). A recent extreme drought was estimated to affect the photosynthetic capacity of 400,000 km 2 of the forest (Anderson et al., 2018b); nevertheless, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the effects of CO2 fertilisation in tropical forests and ecosystems (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Sampaio et al., 2021).

The rise of a large-scale soybean agroindustry in the early 2000s led to a faster increase in human development indicators in some regions, tightly linked to the agricultural production chain (high confidence) (Richards et al., 2015). Such a development also came at considerable cost to the environment (e.g., Neill et al. 2013) and the regional climate, even though a moratorium implemented in 2006 on new soy plantations on deforested areas reduced deforestation by a factor of five (high confidence) (Macedo et al., 2012; Kastens et al., 2017).

The rural population already suffers from natural water scarcity in the countryside. The drought in 2012 was responsible for reducing up to 99% of the corn production in Pernambuco state (Government of Brazil, 2020). A predicted increase in drought, coupled with inadequate soil management practices by small farmers and agribusiness, increases the region’s susceptibility to desertification (Spinoni et al., 2015; Vieira et al., 2015; Mariano et al., 2018; Tomasella et al., 2018; Marengo et al., 2020c). In NES, 70,000 km 2 have reached a point at which agriculture is no longer possible (Government of Brazil, 2020). Intense droughts have triggered migration to urban centres within and outside NES (Confalonieri et al., 2014a; Government of Brazil, 2020). More than 10 million people have been impacted by the drought of 2012/2014 in the region, which was responsible for water shortage and contamination, increasing death by diarrhoea (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015; Government of Brazil, 2020)."

Although agriculture makes a modest contribution to the region’s economy, its drop could have a severe impact on the poorest rural household by shrinking the agricultural labour market and increasing food prices (Ferreira Filho and Moraes, 2015; Government of Brazil, 2020). The expected increase in dryness is also predicted to impact the region’s hydroelectric power generation (Marengo et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2018).

wg2_ch12_12.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Several of the key risks identified for the CSA region align well with the overarching key risks assessed in AR5 (Oppenheimer et al., 2014) and later in O’Neill et al. (2017), as well as with the representative key risks assessed in Section 16.5 of this report. The identified key risks include the following: KR1: risk of food insecurity due to frequent and/or extreme droughts; KR2: risk to life and infrastructure due to floods and landslides; KR3: risk of water insecurity; KR4: risk of severe health effects due to increasing epidemics (in particular vector-borne diseases); KR5: systemic risks of surpassing infrastructure and public service systems capacities; KR6: risk of large-scale changes and biome shifts in the Amazon; KR7: risk to coral reef ecosystems due to coral bleaching; KR8: risks to coastal socioecological systems due to SLR, storm surges and coastal erosion (Table 12.6; Figure 12.11; Table SM12.5)."
wg2_ch12_12.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Identification and assessment of key risks are informed by observed and projected impacts in the different sub-regions of CSA (Section 12.3). Figure 12.10 shows a summary of different levels of observed and future impacts per sub-region for different sectors, based on a detailed assessment of climate-change impacts on various systems and components for the corresponding sector (Figure 12.9). This assessment is consistent with and complementary to the assessment in Section 12.3. A synthesis of these impacts (Figure 12.10) indicates the following: Climate change has or will have a major impact on the observed and future decline of Andean glaciers and snow (high confidence) and lead to the degradation of permafrost and destabilisation of related landscapes (medium evidence, high agreement ). Water quality is a major concern across the region, but there is limited evidence of impacts of climate change on water quality as well as on groundwater. Climate change has had a significant impact on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the NWS, SES and SWS sub-regions and a medium impact in the other sub-regions, but the level of confidence varies across sub-regions. Projections indicate a strong impact of climate change on these ecosystems for the future (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ). Many aspects and assets of ocean and coastal ecosystems (e.g., mangroves, coral reefs, saltmarshes) were identified as being strongly impacted by climate change, both for observed and future periods (high confidence) (Section 12.5.2; Figure 12.9)."

For some sub-regions, the available literature does not allow for an assessment of impacts on various human systems, including cities and infrastructure, health, poverty, livelihoods, migration, conflicts and IKLK, especially for future time periods. This points to important knowledge gaps about climate-change impacts on human systems. The indication of high impacts on several human systems and sub-regions points to the need to close these knowledge gaps."
wg2_ch12_12.4_p9,NO_TITLE,"Assessment of key observed and projected impacts and risks shows that in the CSA region several systems are already approaching critical thresholds under current warming levels, in particular glaciers in the Andes, coral reefs in CA (high confidence) and ocean and coastal ecosystems in virtually all sub-regions (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ). Some systems could cross these thresholds with different levels of reversibility depending on the degree of future warming, that is, glaciers in the Andes and coral reefs in CA, which will show partial but irreversible loss already under low levels of warming (RCP2.6) (high confidence). The risk of large-scale ecological changes and biome shifts of the Amazon rainforest, that is, a transition from tropical forest into other biomes such as seasonal forest or savannah, is now assessed with medium confidence, with the extent of the changes depending on the level of future warming and non-climatic drivers (land use change, deforestation, forest fire practices)."

The COVID-19 crisis has exposed the existing vulnerabilities in important systems, in particular health systems and public services (Phillips et al., 2020). However, tipping points in social systems are poorly understood (Bentley et al., 2014; Milkoreit et al., 2018), and there is limited evidence to inform understanding about which level of compound climatic, environmental and socioeconomic stressors social systems will withstand in CSA."
wg2_ch12_12.4_p11,NO_TITLE,"Overall, most key risks and their severity and extent are strongly driven and determined by system exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity. In particular, the high vulnerability of large populations, infrastructure and service systems, such as health, food and energy production and supply, are important factors, along with high levels of inequality and poor governance, for creating and increasing key risks (high confidence). Prevailing low levels of available information and understanding exacerbate the uncertainties surrounding key risks and so pose limitations to adaptation. An example is CA, with its high levels of vulnerability and exposure, but there is limited evidence and understanding on impacts and risks, making this region susceptible to inappropriate adaptation to expected future climate-change impacts."

In this context, this section assesses, through a sectoral approach, the main challenges, opportunities, trends and initiatives to adapt to climate change in the region."
wg2_ch12_12.5.1_p1,12.5.1.1 Challenges and Opportunities ,"CSA is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, hosting unique socioecosystems that will be strongly impacted by climate change (high confidence) (Section 12.3; Cross-Chapter Paper 1; CAF, 2014; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016; IPBES, 2018a; Li et al., 2018; Retsa et al., 2020). Warming has generated extreme heat events in many parts of CSA (IPCC, 2019a) that, together with droughts and floods, will seriously affect the integrity of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the entire region (Section 12.3; CAF, 2014). A reduction in net primary productivity in tropical forests and glacier retreat in the Andes, for example, are expected to cause significant negative socioecological impacts (Feldpausch et al., 2016; Lyra et al., 2017; Cuesta et al., 2019) (Case Study, 12.7.1). Biodiversity hotspots in the region are well assessed in the literature compared to other regions of the world, especially the Atlantic Forest, Mesoamerica and Cerrado (Section CCP1.2.2; Manes et al., 2021). Up to 85% of evaluated natural systems (species, habitats and communities) in the literature for biodiversity hotspots since AR5 were projected to be negatively impacted by climate change (high confidence), with 26% of projections predicting species extinctions (Section CCP1.2.2; Manes et al., 2021). IKLK play an important role in adaptation and are vital components of many socioecological systems, while also being threatened by climate change (high confidence) (Box 7.1) (Valdivia et al., 2010; Tengö et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Harvey et al., 2017; Diamond and Ansharyani, 2018; Camico et al., 2021)."

In the last three decades, SA has been a significant contributor to the growth of agricultural production worldwide (OECD/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2015), driven partly by increased international demand for commodities, especially soybeans and meat (IPCC, 2019a). Between 2001 and 2015 about 65% of all forest disturbance in the region was associated with commodity-driven deforestation (Curtis et al., 2018). High rates of native vegetation conversion in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru threaten important ecosystems (Amazon, Cerrado, Chacos and Llanos savannahs, Atlantic rainforest, Caatinga and Yungas) (Graesser et al., 2015; FAO, 2016c). Almost two-thirds of soy consumed in EU+ comes from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay (IDH, 2020), increasing conversion risk in the Amazon, Cerrado and Gran Chaco. Despite growing commodity production traceability, in 2018 only 19% of the soybean meal consumed in EU+ was certified deforestation-free and 38% compliant with the FEFAC Soy Sourcing Guidelines (IDH, 2020), which poses a serious challenge at the international level (Negra et al., 2014; Curtis et al., 2018; Lambin et al., 2018; IDH, 2020)."

These strategies also satisfy international forest and water conservation agendas in terms of optimising resources and solutions (Strassburg et al., 2019). Global conservation and sustainable development commitments, such as the Aichi Targets (Convention on Biological Diversity [CBD]), Sustainable Development Goals (UN), the NDCs under the Paris Agreement and the New York Declaration on Forests, strongly rely on nature-based solutions (NbS) to achieve their objectives (Brancalion et al., 2019) (Figure 12.12). The COVID-19 outbreak also brought attention to the need to preserve tropical forests as a means of preventing spillover of viruses from wildlife to humans, with concerns over that risk in the Amazon (Allen et al., 2017b; Dobson et al., 2020; IPBES, 2020; Ferreira et al., 2021).

Protected area in CSA are underfunded (very high confidence). Latin American (including Mexico) governments allocate just about 1% of their national environmental budgets on protected areas (about USD 1.18 ha −1 on average). This figure only covers 54% of their basic needs, resulting in insufficient management. The financing gap to achieve optimal needs for protected areas in CSA is approximately USD 700 million yr −1 (Bovarnick et al., 2010). This seriously compromises the management and delivery capacity of protected areas for climate-change adaptation and preparedness for ongoing ecological transformation (van Kerkhoff et al., 2019). Furthermore, to become a relevant mechanism for resilience, protected areas need to be managed for this purpose (Mansourian et al., 2009). About 40% of protected areas in Latin America and the Caribbean (including Mexico) have undertaken management effectiveness evaluations (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2020a). This is hardly representative of Aichi’s Target 11, although far better than the 11% global average. Collaborations with Indigenous Peoples and local communities are also an important issue to consolidate protected areas (Gross et al., 2016). In addition to protected areas as solutions for climate-change adaptation and mitigation, there is also a need to protect or restore ecosystems outside the protected areas, as illustrated by the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (Imbach et al., 2013)."

Administration coordination and the progress in adaptive ecosystem management are still in their early stages, due in part to the lack of stable financial resources and scientific knowledge and IKLK about adapting ecosystems to climate change (Bustamante et al., 2020). Brazil was an exception, showing dramatic policy-driven reduction in deforestation in the Amazon between 2004–2012, with a concomitant 70% increase in soy production, the most profitable Amazon crop (Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014). Policies included territorial planning (protected areas, Indigenous territories and land tenure), satellite monitoring and market and credit restrictions on high-deforesting municipalities, plus some incentives to small farmers (Boucher et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014; Castelo, 2015; Cunha et al., 2016a). It is important to highlight the important role of Indigenous territories, in addition to protected areas, in forest conservation in the Amazon (high evidence, medium agreement ) (Schwartzman et al., 2013; Barber et al., 2014; Nepstad et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2014b).

Conservation incentives, a new complementary and allegedly cost-effective approach, is increasingly being implemented in the region (Magrin et al., 2014). They include PES, REDD+, environmental certification and conservation easements, but remain controversial, and more research is needed on their effectiveness, possible negative side effects, participatory management systems and collective decision-making processes (Larson and Petkova, 2011; Locatelli et al., 2011; Pinho et al., 2014; Strassburg et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Scarano et al., 2018; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019; Vallet et al., 2019)."

Other examples in the Andes are the GLORIA-Andes network (Cuesta et al., 2017a), the Andean Forest Network (Malizia et al., 2020) and the Initiative of Hydrological Monitoring in the Andes (IMHEA), with measures to optimise watershed management and protection and reduce the risk of water insecurity (Correa et al., 2020)."

wg2_ch12_12.5.1.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Since AR5, there has been an increase in the number of adaptation measures through natural resource and ecosystem service management. The main approaches are EbA and community-based adaptation (CbA) (high confidence) (NCs, NDCs and NAPs, https://unfccc.int). IKLK can be very detailed and usually relates to people’s priorities as identified by collective decision-making (Box 7.1) (Hurlbert et al., 2019, SRCCL Section 7.6.4; SRCCL Cross-Chapter Box 13 ILK; de Coninck et al., 2018, SR1.5 Section 4.3.5.5). In Manaus, central Amazon, fishermen perceive reductions in fish size, diversity and capture levels caused by droughts, while recognising that floods hinder access to fishing grounds (Keenan, 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016). In the Amazon floodplains, small-scale fisher and farmer communities incorporate their knowledge on natural hydrologic and ecological processes into management systems that reduce climate-change risk and impacts (Oviedo et al., 2016). Smallholder grain farmers in Guatemala and Honduras implement EbA practices based on local knowledge (e.g., live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, dispersed trees in corn fields and other food insecurity risk reduction practices) (Harvey et al., 2017; Chain-Guadarrama et al., 2018). There is, therefore, great potential for terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem adaptation to climate change in CSA, provided the right incentives and sociocultural protective measures are in place (high confidence) (Section 12.5.10.4; Table SM12.7)."

Important adaptation actions have been undertaken in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, both in policymaking and institutional arrangements, but they tend to be poorly coordinated with policies on development, land planning and other sectoral policies (Ryan, 2012). Some type of community participation mechanisms is present in most country strategies, but their levels of implementation vary considerably (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Ryan, 2012; Pires et al., 2017; Calispa, 2018)."

Combined adaptation and mitigation strategies can produce positive results, but they are often disconnected (Locatelli et al., 2015). Most reviewed cases in agriculture and forestry in Latin America (84% of 274 cases) reported positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation. Nevertheless, research on Latin American forests tend to focus on mitigation, while studies on agriculture are usually oriented towards adaptation (high confidence) (Locatelli et al., 2015, 2017)."

They include PES, REDD+, environmental certification and conservation easements, but remain controversial, and more research is needed on their effectiveness, possible negative side effects, participatory management systems and collective decision-making processes (Larson and Petkova, 2011; Locatelli et al., 2011; Pinho et al., 2014; Strassburg et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Scarano et al., 2018; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019; Vallet et al., 2019)."

In Manaus, central Amazon, fishermen perceive reductions in fish size, diversity and capture levels caused by droughts, while recognising that floods hinder access to fishing grounds (Keenan, 2015; Camacho Guerreiro et al., 2016). In the Amazon floodplains, small-scale fisher and farmer communities incorporate their knowledge on natural hydrologic and ecological processes into management systems that reduce climate-change risk and impacts (Oviedo et al., 2016). Smallholder grain farmers in Guatemala and Honduras implement EbA practices based on local knowledge (e.g., live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, dispersed trees in corn fields and other food insecurity risk reduction practices) (Harvey et al., 2017; Chain-Guadarrama et al., 2018).

There is high confidence that sandy beach ecosystems of CSA countries have suffered significant losses of dunes as a consequence of the construction of infrastructures that have caused interruptions in the natural dynamic of beaches, reducing protection against tides, waves, extreme events or tsunamis (high confidence) (Amaral et al., 2016; Bernardino et al., 2016; González and Holtmann-Ahumada, 2017; Obraczka et al., 2017). Also, adaptation measures to cope with SLR and coastal extreme events sometimes fail because they exacerbate coastal erosion and damage (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Spalding et al., 2014; Lins-de-Barros and Parente-Ribeiro, 2018). There is medium evidence but high agreement  that the most serious barriers limiting the success of adaptation strategies in ocean and coastal systems in CSA stem from a lack of coordination (e.g., absence of participatory processes, overlapping among fishing and protection activities), lack of knowledge (e.g., poor monitoring, poor control and surveillance, no long-term studies) and lack of adequate metrics for evaluating adaptation actions informing decision makers hinder the continuity and adjustment of measures and lead to weak governance (e.g., perverse incentives, resource overexploitation, conflicts), a lack of financial resources and long-term commitments (e.g., crisis, lack of budgets, market fluctuations), weak policies, cultural constraints, poverty, low flexibility, lack of awareness of climate risks and lack of engagement by stakeholders (Leal Filho, 2018; Nagy et al., 2019; Moreno et al., 2020b; Aburto et al., 2021)."

Major Brazilian fisheries do not follow an ecosystem approach to management, although some small-scale fisheries apply a precautionary approach (Singh-Renton and McIvor, 2015). The management of Peruvian artisanal (medium and small-scale) fisheries is minimal and is governed by a lack of regulations, control and management actions (Bertrand et al., 2018). In Argentina, recreational marine fisheries have been largely unregulated, and there exists a lack of monitoring programmes, which has contributed to the overexploitation of some key coastal stocks (Venerus and Cedrola, 2017). Moreover, womenfisher in CSA are excluded of the decision-making processes (FAO, 2016b; Bruguere and Williams, 2017).

Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has emerged as a suitable tool to minimise the risk to climate change, avoid ecosystem degradation and related services (Gullestad et al., 2017). Further, when EBFM includes climate complexity and the relationships among species within the ecological systems it contributes to maintain long-term socioeconomic benefits (Long et al., 2015).

Adaptation to changing water availability is therefore a priority, but most efforts are documented only in the grey literature (e.g., governmental documents, project reports) with highly variable standards of quality and evidence. Most of the documented adaptation initiatives are in an early planning or implementation stage and evidence on successful outcomes is quite limited (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021). However, the growing number of adaptation initiatives across the CSA region has contributed to improved understanding of complex interlinkages of climate change, human vulnerabilities, local policies and feasible adaptation approaches (McDowell et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In several regions of CSA, water scarcity is a serious challenge to local livelihoods and economic activities. Regions that are (seasonally) dry, partly with large populations and increasing water demand, exhibit particularly significant water stress. These include the Dry Corridor in CA, coastal areas of Peru (SWS) and northern Chile (SWS), the Bolivian-Peruvian Altiplano (NWS, SAM), the Dry Andes of Central Chile (SWS), Western Argentina and Chaco in northwestern Paraguay (SES) and Sertão in northeastern Brazil (NES) (high confidence) (Kummu et al., 2016; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016; Schoolmeester et al., 2018). In NWS and SWS, downstream areas are increasingly affected by decreasing and unreliable river runoff due to rapid glacier shrinkage (high confidence) (Table SM12.6; Carey et al., 2014; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Buytaert et al., 2017). Many regions in CSA rely heavily on hydroelectric energy, and as a result of rising energy demand, hydropower capacity is constantly being extended (Schoolmeester et al., 2018). Worldwide, SA features the second-fastest growth rate, with about 5.2 GW additional annual capacity installed in 2019 (IHA, 2020). This development requires additional water storage options, which entail the construction of large dams and reservoirs with important social-ecological implications. River fragmentation and corresponding loss of habitat connectivity due to dam constructions have been described for, for example, the NSA, SAM, NES and SES (high confidence) (Grill et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2018a),  with important implications for freshwater biota, such as fish migration (medium confidence) (Pelicice et al., 2015; Herrera-R et al., 2020). Furthermore, examples in, for instance, NWS (Carey et al., 2012; Duarte-Abadía et al., 2015; Hommes and Boelens, 2018) and SWS (Muñoz et al., 2019b) showcase unresolved water-related conflicts between local villagers, peasant communities, hydropower operators and governmental institutions in a context of distrust and lack of water governance (high confidence)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.3.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"Increasing water scarcity is also shaped by poor water quality, which has barely been assessed in CSA. Declining water quality can be observed, for example, due to intense agricultural and industrial activities in SWS, SES and SSA (medium confidence) (Mekonnen et al., 2015; Gomez et al., 2021), mining in Andean headwaters (NWS, SWS and Western SAM) and tropical lowlands (eastern SAM and NSA) (medium confidence) (Bebbington et al., 2015 risk and climate resilience; Vuille et al., 2018), urban domestic use (Desbureaux and Rodella, 2019), decreasing meltwater contribution (Milner et al., 2017) and acid rock drainages from recently exposed glacial sediments (Santofimia et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018).

Inequalities can be further exacerbated by unregulated or privately owned water rights and allocation systems (e.g., in Chile) (Muñoz et al., 2020a).

However, ‘hard path’ interventions are now strongly contested because negative effects exacerbate local water conflicts (Carey et al., 2012; Boelens et al., 2019; Drenkhan et al., 2019), potentially leading to increasing water demand, vulnerabilities and water shortage risks (Di Baldassarre et al., 2018), thereby limiting adaptive capacity (high confidence) (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019). More integrated approaches focus on multiple uses of water storage with shared stakeholder vision, responsibilities, rights and costs, as well as risks and benefits, and often integrating water and risk management (Branche, 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017; Drenkhan et al., 2019). In this chapter, a feasibility assessment was carried out for six major dimensions of multi-use water storage for the entire CSA (Table 12.11). While geophysical and economic aspects allow for the implementation of water storage projects under a multi-use approach, the institutional, social and environmental dimensions pose a major barrier (Section 12.5.3). Further demand-oriented approaches focus on incentives for the reduction of water use through changes in people’s habits, efficiency increase and smart water management (Gleick, 2002). These are promoted in some regions, such as in CA and NWS (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), to foster a sustainable water culture (Bremer et al., 2016; Paerregaard et al., 2016)."

Some examples include the reactivation of ancestral infiltration enhancement systems in the Peruvian Andes (NWS) (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019), the use of erosion control structures in the Bolivian Altiplano (SAM) (Hartman et al., 2016) and the potential improvement of drinking water quality and flood risk reduction in urban areas of CSA (Tellman et al., 2018) (Section 12.5.5.3.2). Additionally, NbS in combination with ecosystem and community-based adaptation potentially generate important co-benefits, including increasing water security and the attenuation of social conflicts in Chile (SWS) (Reid et al., 2018), water conservation in coastal Peru (NWS) and flood protection in Guyana (NSA) (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Spencer et al., 2017).

One example is the adapted use of agrobiodiversity when dealing with more frequent and intense tidal floods in the Amazon delta (NSA) (Vogt et al., 2016). In another context, IKLK has been considered for the evaluation of water scarcity and GLOF risks in Peru (NWS) (Motschmann et al., 2020b). Additionally, local citizen science-based initiatives (Buytaert et al., 2014; Tellman et al., 2016; Njue et al., 2019) can support the production of multiple forms of knowledge with flexible and extensive data collection. Important questions centre around how to integrate IKLK and other types of knowledge from the early planning stages on, to achieve enhanced or transformational adaptation building on co-produced knowledge (Kates et al., 2012; Klenk et al., 2017). NbS combined with community engagement and integration of diverse knowledge can foster transformational adaptation of social-ecological systems (Palomo et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.3.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"National policies on climate change, water protection, regulation and management laws are important focal areas of adaptation in the water sector (Section 4.7). Notable in the jurisdiction field is the Glacier Protection Law in place in Argentina (2010–2019) and under construction in Chile (since 2005). This first glacier law in the world represents a milestone for high-mountain conservation but is also criticised for hindering effective disaster risk adaptation measures and excluding local socioeconomic needs (Anacona et al., 2018). Furthermore, the first Framework Law on Climate Change was implemented in Peru (2018) and is under way in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela (Figure 12.13; Table SM12.6). Overarching regional institutions (e.g., OAS [2016])  and most countries in CSA promote a move towards more integrative and sustainable management of water resources through new legislation and financing mechanisms. For instance, new water laws that include principles of integrated water resource management (IWRM) have entered into force, for example, in Nicaragua (2007), Peru (2009), Ecuador (2014) and Costa Rica (2014), or are under way, such as in Colombia (since 2009). However, current realities in all regions show major challenges in implementing IWRM mechanisms and policies, related but not limited to political and institutional instabilities, governance structures, fragmented service provision, lack of economies of scale and scope, corruption and social conflicts (high confidence) (WWAP, 2020)."

In turn, inclusive water regimes leverage long-term adaptation planning. These have been addressed in some national strategies, such as in Brazil (Ministry of Environment of Brazil, 2016a). At the local level, a decentralised and participatory bottom-up water governance model was induced by civil society and research institutions to foster rainwater harvesting technologies reducing drought risk in semiarid Brazil (NES) (Lindoso et al., 2018)."

These funding deficits set important limitations on future water provision, adaptation to changing water resources and the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 (high confidence) (WHO, 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.3.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Although a growing body of adaptation initiatives exists for CSA, evidence on their effectiveness is scarce. In many parts of CSA the level of success of adaptation measures depends largely on the governance of projects and stakeholder-based processes and is closely related to their effectiveness, efficiency, social equity and sociopolitical legitimacy (high confidence) (Adger et al., 2005; Rasmussen, 2016b; Moulton et al., 2021). Several PES experiences across CSA have been described as successful measures for watershed conservation and adaptation (high confidence). An example of success is the Quito water fund in Ecuador, which aims to improve the city’s water quality by integrating public and private stakeholder interests with ecosystem conservation and local community development since the 2000s (Bremer et al., 2016; Grima et al., 2016) (Case Study 12.6.1). At the same time, in Moyobamba in Peru, the development of a watershed protection programme was leveraged by a multi-stakeholder platform process that enabled deep social learning (Lindsay, 2018). In turn, initiatives that do not consider the entire set of social-ecological dimensions and dynamics of adaptation or unintentionally increase vulnerabilities of human or natural systems are at risk of leading to reduced outcomes (McDowell et al., 2021) or maladaptation (Reid et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019; Eriksen et al., 2021). However, systematic assessments of maladaptation in the water sector have barely been provided for CSA."

Examples of soft adaptation limits (i.e., options to avoid intolerable risks currently not available) include lack of trust and stakeholder flexibility, associated with unequal power relations that lead to reduced social learning and poor outcomes for improved water management, as reported in, for example, NWS (Lindsay, 2018). An example of hard adaptation limits (i.e., intolerable risks cannot be avoided) in the region is the loss of livelihoods and cultural values associated with glacier shrinkage in NWS (Jurt et al., 2015)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.3.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Most barriers to advance adaptation in CSA correspond to soft limits associated with missing links of science–society–policy processes, institutional fragilities, pronounced hierarchies, unequal power relations and top-down water governance regimes (high confidence). One example is the abandonment of long-term hydrological monitoring sites within tropical Andean ecosystems (paramo) in Venezuela (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2019) due to the lack of governmental support during the political crisis. In that regard, the collection and availability of consistent hydroclimatic and socioeconomic data at adequate scales represent an important challenge in CSA. Major adaptation barriers are furthermore reported from central Chile in the context of a mega-drought since 2010, related to socioeconomic factors and a deficient bottom-up approach to informing and developing public policy (Aldunce et al., 2017). These gaps could be bridged by strengthening transdisciplinary approaches at the science–policy interface (Lillo-Ortega et al., 2019) with blended bottom-up and top-down adaptation to include scientific knowledge with impact and scenario assessments in local adaptation agendas (Huggel et al., 2015b). For instance, a new allocation rule for the Laja reservoir in southern Chile (SWS), based on consistent water balance modelling results, could inform policy and water management and potentially improve local water management and reduce water conflicts over the long term (Muñoz et al., 2019b)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.3.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"In several regions of CSA, water scarcity is a serious challenge to local livelihoods and economic activities. Regions that are (seasonally) dry, partly with large populations and increasing water demand, exhibit particularly significant water stress. These include the Dry Corridor in CA, coastal areas of Peru (SWS) and northern Chile (SWS), the Bolivian-Peruvian Altiplano (NWS, SAM), the Dry Andes of Central Chile (SWS), Western Argentina and Chaco in northwestern Paraguay (SES) and Sertão in northeastern Brazil (NES) (high confidence) (Kummu et al., 2016; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016; Schoolmeester et al., 2018). In NWS and SWS, downstream areas are increasingly affected by decreasing and unreliable river runoff due to rapid glacier shrinkage (high confidence) (Table SM12.6; Carey et al., 2014; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Buytaert et al., 2017). Many regions in CSA rely heavily on hydroelectric energy, and as a result of rising energy demand, hydropower capacity is constantly being extended (Schoolmeester et al., 2018). Worldwide, SA features the second-fastest growth rate, with about 5.2 GW additional annual capacity installed in 2019 (IHA, 2020). This development requires additional water storage options, which entail the construction of large dams and reservoirs with important social-ecological implications. River fragmentation and corresponding loss of habitat connectivity due to dam constructions have been described for, for example, the NSA, SAM, NES and SES (high confidence) (Grill et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2018a),  with important implications for freshwater biota, such as fish migration (medium confidence) (Pelicice et al., 2015; Herrera-R et al., 2020). Furthermore, examples in, for instance, NWS (Carey et al., 2012; Duarte-Abadía et al., 2015; Hommes and Boelens, 2018) and SWS (Muñoz et al., 2019b) showcase unresolved water-related conflicts between local villagers, peasant communities, hydropower operators and governmental institutions in a context of distrust and lack of water governance (high confidence)."

wg2_ch12_12.5.3.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Most adaptive water management approaches in CSA centre around extending the water supply side, including large infrastructure projects. However, ‘hard path’ interventions are now strongly contested because negative effects exacerbate local water conflicts (Carey et al., 2012; Boelens et al., 2019; Drenkhan et al., 2019), potentially leading to increasing water demand, vulnerabilities and water shortage risks (Di Baldassarre et al., 2018), thereby limiting adaptive capacity (high confidence) (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019). More integrated approaches focus on multiple uses of water storage with shared stakeholder vision, responsibilities, rights and costs, as well as risks and benefits, and often integrating water and risk management (Branche, 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017; Drenkhan et al., 2019). In this chapter, a feasibility assessment was carried out for six major dimensions of multi-use water storage for the entire CSA (Table 12.11). While geophysical and economic aspects allow for the implementation of water storage projects under a multi-use approach, the institutional, social and environmental dimensions pose a major barrier (Section 12.5.3). Further demand-oriented approaches focus on incentives for the reduction of water use through changes in people’s habits, efficiency increase and smart water management (Gleick, 2002). These are promoted in some regions, such as in CA and NWS (e.g., Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), to foster a sustainable water culture (Bremer et al., 2016; Paerregaard et al., 2016)."

NbS potentially enhance water infiltration, groundwater recharge and surface storage, contribute to disaster risk reduction and can replace or complement grey (i.e., conventionally built) infrastructure that is often socioenvironmentally contested (WWAP, 2018). Some examples include the reactivation of ancestral infiltration enhancement systems in the Peruvian Andes (NWS) (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019), the use of erosion control structures in the Bolivian Altiplano (SAM) (Hartman et al., 2016) and the potential improvement of drinking water quality and flood risk reduction in urban areas of CSA (Tellman et al., 2018) (Section 12.5.5.3.2). Additionally, NbS in combination with ecosystem and community-based adaptation potentially generate important co-benefits, including increasing water security and the attenuation of social conflicts in Chile (SWS) (Reid et al., 2018), water conservation in coastal Peru (NWS) and flood protection in Guyana (NSA) (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Spencer et al., 2017).

One example is the adapted use of agrobiodiversity when dealing with more frequent and intense tidal floods in the Amazon delta (NSA) (Vogt et al., 2016). In another context, IKLK has been considered for the evaluation of water scarcity and GLOF risks in Peru (NWS) (Motschmann et al., 2020b). Additionally, local citizen science-based initiatives (Buytaert et al., 2014; Tellman et al., 2016; Njue et al., 2019) can support the production of multiple forms of knowledge with flexible and extensive data collection. Important questions centre around how to integrate IKLK and other types of knowledge from the early planning stages on, to achieve enhanced or transformational adaptation building on co-produced knowledge (Kates et al., 2012; Klenk et al., 2017).

This first glacier law in the world represents a milestone for high-mountain conservation but is also criticised for hindering effective disaster risk adaptation measures and excluding local socioeconomic needs (Anacona et al., 2018). Furthermore, the first Framework Law on Climate Change was implemented in Peru (2018) and is under way in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela (Figure 12.13; Table SM12.6). Overarching regional institutions (e.g., OAS [2016])  and most countries in CSA promote a move towards more integrative and sustainable management of water resources through new legislation and financing mechanisms. For instance, new water laws that include principles of integrated water resource management (IWRM) have entered into force, for example, in Nicaragua (2007), Peru (2009), Ecuador (2014) and Costa Rica (2014), or are under way, such as in Colombia (since 2009).

Agricultural commodities (coffee, bananas, sugar, soybean, corn, sugarcane, beef livestock) are some of the highest users of ecosystem resources such as land, water, nutrients and technology. These exports have gained importance in the past two decades as international trade and globalisation of markets have shaped the global agri-food system. However continuous overuse of the environment might account for resource depletion (deforestation, land degradation, nutrient depletion, pollution), affecting the natural capital base. The effects of climate change on humans, via ecological systems, exacerbate the impact related to the depletion of ecosystem services (Scholes, 2016; IPBES, 2018b; Castaneda Sanchez et al., 2019; Clerici et al., 2019; Tellman et al., 2020; Pacheco et al., 2021)."

In Panama, information on dengue is distributed in a monthly bulletin that is used by health authorities to inform vector control activities (McDonald et al., 2016). Another example is the climate-driven forecast of dengue risk that was produced prior to Brazil’s 2014 FIFA World Cup to inform disease prevention interventions (Lowe et al., 2014, 2016). In Colombia, the Intersectoral National Technical Commission for Environmental Health publishes a monthly bulletin with regional weather forecasts and potential effects on health (CONASA, 2019).

However, deforestation and malaria have a complex relationship that relies on local context interactions, where land use and land cover changes play an important role due to vector ecology alterations and social conditions of human settlements (Rubio-Palis et al., 2013). Forest conservation can improve hydrological cycle control and soil erosion that can help to improve water quality and reduce the burden of water-borne diseases. In addition, forest cover can help to diminish the habitat for larval mosquitoes that transmit malaria.

There is a need to better understand complex interactions and community responses to climate change in the Amazonian and Andean regions. Climate-change hotspot impacts have shown that poverty reduction measures alone were not enough to improve adaptive capacity because people will not necessarily invest in their enhancement (Pinho et al., 2014; Filho et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Lapola et al., 2018; Zavaleta et al., 2018). Current adaptation strategies and methods may be neglecting cultural values, even eroding them, in the Peruvian Andes, indicating that success of adaptation practices is tied to deep cultural values (Walshe and Argumedo, 2016)."

More inclusive planning processes correspond to higher climate equity and justice outcomes in the short term, but an emphasis on building dedicated multi-sector governance institutions may also enhance long-term programmes’ stability while ensuring civil society has a voice in adaptation planning and implementation (Chu et al., 2016). Some local organisations and people have succeeded when they were in charge of their own resiliency efforts, where international projects and protocols proved less effective (Doughty, 2016). Some decentralised governmental programmes have tried to increase public responsiveness to the adaptation needs of the people, but such programmes have proven to be only mildly successful and provoke the mobilisation of communities against existing governance structures (Thompson, 2016)."

IK has been adaptive for long periods in the Andes (Cuvi, 2018), but there might be limits to adaptation in the face of present climatic and other environmental and socioeconomic drivers (Postigo, 2019).

Indigenous and social movements have joined with climate justice activists, calling for action to address climate change (Hicks and Fabricant, 2016; Ruiz-Mallén et al., 2017; Charles, 2021). The Bolivian Platform against Climate Change, a coalition of civil society and social movement organisations working to address the effects of global warming in Bolivia and to influence the broader global community, reflects an innovative dimension that, though at times conflictual, has shown how increasing climate variability hinders the right of Indigenous Peoples to the conservation of their culture and practices and illustrates how grassroots movements are increasingly taking over climate-change policy in the region (Hicks and Fabricant, 2016). Social movements have engaged with international networks, such as Blokadia, which surged after COP 23, whose claims try to go beyond the protection of the environment and delve into issues of democracy and resource control (Martínez-Alier et al., 2018)."

Also, in El Cambray II, in Guatemala City, in 2015 a nearby hill collapsed, causing the deaths of 280 people, 70 missing and the destruction of hundreds of homes. The affected community entered into a conflict with the municipality demanding resettlement and a reform of land-use planning (Stein Heinemann, 2018)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Perception and understanding of climate change can be seen as an adaptive feature. In CSA, the awareness of climate change as a threat is increasing, a situation related to growth in climate justice activism and to the occurrence of extreme weather events of all kinds (high confidence) (Forero et al., 2014; Magrin et al., 2014; Capstick et al., 2015). Perception of climate change is positively associated across countries with the HDI and ND-Gain Readiness Index and negatively associated with the Vulnerability Index and, within countries, with education level, while perception is negatively associated with the degree of political affinity for the market economy (Azócar et al., 2021). However, some communities do not associate their problems with the scientific concept of climate change, so discussions on whether it is human induced and its causes or relationship with other problems can become irrelevant (Sapiains Arrué and Ugarte Caviedes, 2017). Even communities affected by the same changes do not necessarily perceive them in the same way (Bonatti et al., 2016). The interpretations of change, as well as its causes and effects, can vary widely (Paerregaard, 2018; Scoville-Simonds, 2018). Rather than adapting to climate change, some people adapt climate change to their social worlds (Rasmussen, 2016a)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"Perceptions tend to be different in rural and urban areas (Sherman et al., 2015). In rural areas, it largely relates to temperature rise and changes in rainfall patterns, changes in agriculture (pests, calendars), biodiversity loss, solar radiation or changes in the oceans, and their impacts are sometimes related or even more attributed to socioeconomic and environmental drivers, as well as to negative financial outcomes (high confidence) (Infante and Infante, 2013; Postigo, 2014; Jacobi et al., 2015; Barrucand et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2018; Martins and Gasalla, 2018; Meldrum et al., 2018; Córdoba Vargas et al., 2019; Leroy, 2019; Viguera et al., 2019; Gutierrez et al., 2020; Iniguez-Gallardo et al., 2020; Lambert and Eise, 2020). In such places as Amazonia, perception increases with age (Funatsu et al., 2019). In Mediterranean Chile, younger, more educated producers and those who own their land tend to have clearer perceptions than older, less educated or tenant farmers, but they do not have a clear perception or how it may affect their yields and farming operation (Roco et al., 2015). In some dry and humid Ecuadorian montane forests, peasantss perceptions are in line with the scientific data, but they have a lot of difficulties to predict the changes and believe that they may not be prepared and can only be reactive (Herrador-Valencia and Paredes, 2016). In an Andean community, perceptions of climate change are homogeneous and do not vary according to gender, age or ethnicity (Cáceres-Arteaga et al., 2020). Among representatives of five municipalities of Lima, it was found that climate change is not well understood and residents have trouble distinguishing it from other environmental issues (Siña et al., 2016). In an Amazonian region, farmers provided a more accurate description than regional institutions of how it affects the local livelihood system (Altea, 2020). In Cuenca Auqui peasants attribute recently experienced challenges in agricultural production mainly to perceived changes in precipitation patterns, but statistical analyses of daily precipitation records at nearby stations do not corroborate those perceived changes (Gurgiser et al., 2016)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is ample empirical evidence that the impacts of climate change are not of equal scope for men and women. Women, particularly the poorest, are more vulnerable and are impacted in greater proportion. Often, for several economic and social reasons, women have less capacity to adapt, further widening structural gender gaps (high confidence) (Box 7.4; Arana Zegarra, 2017; Casas Varez, 2017; Segnestam, 2017; Acosta et al., 2019; Aldunce Ide et al., 2020; Olivera et al., 2021; Silva Rodríguez de San Miguel et al., 2021). Gender equity is deemed to be central to discussions on climate-change adaptation policies. In issues such as drinking water, energy, disasters, impacts on health and agriculture and capacity to migrate, women (poor women in particular) are affected in greater proportion, further widening structural gender gaps. In a rural community vulnerable to drought, short-term coping was more common among the women, especially among female heads of household, while adaptive actions were more common among the men; there are gendered inequalities in access to and control over different forms of capital that lead to a gender-differentiated capacity to adapt, where men are better able to adapt and women experience a downward spiral in their capacity to adapt and increasing vulnerability to drought (Segnestam, 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"However, women are not always the more vulnerable group. While in a broad sense climate-change impacts women more severely, there are situations where they have reacted, adapted better to or been more resilient. Grassroots women self-help groups can be active agents of change for their communities, designing and delivering gender-responsive adaptation solutions (Huairou Commission, 2019). Some studies suggest that women establish friendlier relationships with the environment and towards natural resources; studies on masculinity and environment confirm this tendency (Brough et al., 2016). In a multi-country study, some female-headed households tend to be slightly less vulnerable and more resilient than male-headed households, though some exceptions were found among sub-groups (Andersen et al., 2017). In Chile, women are more likely to modernise irrigation and infrastructure, and gender appears to be an important element in drought adaptation (Roco et al., 2016). A change to agroecological practices has improved gender equality and adaptive capacity to climate change (Cáceres-Arteaga et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"Recent studies emphasise that a gender approach to social inequalities ought to move beyond just looking at men and women as experiencing impacts in a differentiated manner; rather, an intersectional analysis illuminates how different individuals and groups relate differently to climate change due to their situatedness in power structures based on context-specific and dynamic social categorisations (high confidence) (Kaijser and Kronsell, 2014; Djoudi et al., 2016; Thompson-Hall et al., 2016; Olivera et al., 2021). Thus, the relationship between gender and adaptation demands an analytical framework that connects environmental problems with social inequalities in a complex way (Godfrey, 2012). An intersectional approach helps to better capture the diversity of adaptive strategies that men and women adopt vis-à-vis climate change. Particular constellations of race, gender, class, age or nationality reveal more complex realities (high confidence)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Migration and displacements are multi-causal phenomena, and climate may exacerbate political, social, economic or other environmental drivers (high confidence) (Kaenzig and Piguet, 2014; Brandt et al., 2016; Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Sudmeier-Rieux et al., 2017; Radel et al., 2018; Heslin et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Silva Rodríguez de San Miguel et al., 2021). Many case studies have been conducted on the region, but data to assess and monitor precisely the effects of climate- and weather-related disasters in migration and displacements from a broad perspective remain inaccurate (Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Abeldaño Zuñiga and Fanta Garrido, 2020). The most common climatic drivers include tropical storms and hurricanes, heavy rains, floods and droughts (Kaenzig and Piguet, 2014). Positive climatic conditions also can facilitate migration (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Peru, Colombia and Guatemala are among the countries with the largest average displacements caused by hydro-meteorological causes; Brazil had 295,000 people displaced because of disasters in 2019 (Global Internal Displacement Database, https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"These processes can be interpreted as impacts on vulnerable peoples, but also as adaptation strategies to manage risks and reduce exposure when people continue with their lives, temporarily or permanently, in a different but stable situationor when family members send remittances to those that remain in the affected areas (Section 7.4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). The remittances create opportunities for adaptive capacity building because they reduce some vulnerabilities in the form of infrastructures, agricultural supplies, food, education or health, as in northern CA (NU CEPAL, 2018). Anyhow, migration as adaptation is not available to everyone (Kaenzig and Piguet, 2014), and the idea has also been contested because it may not help to overcome structural problems or point to in situ options (Radel et al., 2018; Ruiz-de-Oña et al., 2019). The causal processes are complex. Surveys of migrants usually find that the main reported reason for migration is to find a job or to increase household income (Wrathall and Suckall, 2016; OIM, 2017; Radel et al., 2018), but the underlying reason for the lack of a job or income is rarely examined and at times may be related to climatic hazards."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Migration most often originates in rural areas, with people moving to other rural or urban areas within their home countries (Table Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE 1 in Chapter 7). In the Amazon, approximately 80% of the population are concentrated in cities due to rural–urban migrations in search of better income, livelihoods and services, in cases associated with extreme floods and droughts (Pinho et al., 2015). In Ecuador, environmental variables are most likely to enhance international than internal migration (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Hurricanes have been seen as positive triggers for international migration in CA (Spencer and Urquhart, 2018). The highlands of Peru see different patterns, including daily circular migration to combine the scarce income from agricultural production with urban income, rather than abandoning farm land (Milan and Ho, 2014; Zimmerer, 2014; Bergmann et al., 2021)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"Migration to cities can mean opportunities for migrants and for urban areas, but it can also worsen existing problems, as urban poor people can become even more exposed and vulnerable, and the pressure on urban capacities may not be well absorbed (high confidence) (Chisari and Miller, 2016; Gemenne et al., 2020). Internal migration to cities is likely to exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities related to inequality, poverty, indigence and informal activities and housing (Warn and Adamo, 2014). Immigration can make cities/residents more vulnerable to climate-change risks (Sections 12.5.5 and 12.5.7). Groups such as children, Indigenous Peoples and the poor are usually among the most vulnerable in migrations and displacements, which poses challenges to national policies and international aid (Sedeh, 2014; Gamez, 2016; Ulla, 2016; Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017; Ramos and de Salles Cavedon-Capdeville, 2017; Amar-Amar et al., 2019; Gemenne et al., 2020). In migration or displacement driven by climate effects, women are prone to lose their leadership, autonomy and voice, especially in new organisational structures imposed by authorities. This is especially the case in temporary accommodation camps created after disasters, exacerbating existing differentiated vulnerabilities (Aldunce Ide et al., 2020). International migration has become more dangerous and difficult as border controls have become stricter, but programmes such as one to help temporary agricultural workers from Guatemala to Canada have proven successful (Gabriel and Macdonald, 2018). At the same time, emigration may lead to the loss of IKLK for adaptation (Moreno et al., 2020b)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Some areas are more likely to generate climatic migration: the Andes, the dry areas of Amazonia, northern Brazil and northern countries in CA (high confidence). Northeastern Brazil will lose population that will move to the south, deepening existing inequalities (Oliveira and Pereda, 2020). In a study of eight countries around the world, including Guatemala and Peru, a link was found between rainfall variability and food insecurity, which could lead to migration in areas of high prevalence of rainfed agriculture and low diversification (Warner and Afifi, 2014). In CA, younger individuals are more likely to migrate in response to hurricanes and especially to droughts (Baez et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"The perception of gradual changes lowers the likelihood of internal migration, while sudden-onset events increase movement (Koubi et al., 2016). On the other hand, it has been seen that extreme events like floods or droughts can hinder population mobility, immobilising them in their localities (Thiede et al., 2016). These immobilised populations are supposed to face a double set of risks: they are unable to move away from environmental threats, and their lack of capital makes them especially vulnerable to environmental changes (Black et al., 2011). In CSA, migrating to the US is becoming dangerous and expensive because that country is restricting entry; these trends expose local populations to the risk of becoming immobile in the near future in a place where they are extremely vulnerable (Ruano and Milan, 2014; McLeman, 2019). A survey in Guatemala found no correlation between migration to the US and severe food insecurity in households, but the correlation became significant if the level of food insecurity was moderate, suggesting that families in extreme hardship did not have the resources to migrate (Aguilar et al., 2019). At the same time, some populations just have chosen not to move, as in Peru, where immobility among dissatisfied people is more likely to be caused by attachment to place than resource constraints (Adams, 2016; Correia and Ojima, 2017). Some populations have chosen to adapt relying on their IKLK (Boillat and Berkes, 2013)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Migration is often the last resort for rural communities facing water stress problems (Magrin et al., 2014; Ruano and Milan, 2014). In Bolivia, glacial retreat has not triggered new migration flows and had a limited impact on the existing migratory patterns (Kaenzig, 2015). In SA, climatic variability increases the likelihood of interprovince migration, rather than trapping populations. In a study of interprovincial migration motivated by temperature, an exception arose in Bolivia, and even if that could suggest an immobilised population (Thiede et al., 2016), it is not clear whether they want to stay and adapt. In some cases, people want to move but wait for relocation until after the climate-related disasters have subsided (Priotto and Salvador Aruj, 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Climate-change financing is unequally distributed among CSA countries (high confidence). Financing of climate-change adaptation remains very much delegated to multilateral and bilateral cooperation, and the governments in the region have heavily relied on it. Still, there are some concerns regarding justice in the distribution of these funds (Khan et al., 2020). The UNFCCC has created financing mechanisms throughout its functioning years, but a wide range of issues that present challenges for access by recipients (Hickmann et al., 2019). These include a lack of technical capacity, difficulties in following the procedures established by the various financial entities and low levels of awareness about the need for action, as well as the different sources of funds available. The fiscal policies of various countries have contributed to government financing in the fight against climate change (World Bank, 2021). Since the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged NDCs that introduce the need to design and implement carbon budgets with a corresponding consideration of the efficiency and costs and benefits involved in each mitigation or adaptation to climate-change projects (Fragkos, 2020)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"According to UNFCCC, Latin America and the Caribbean, for the period 2015–2016, obtained 22% of climate financing from multilateral climate funds.

[2016]). According to the data, 76% of climate-related financing went to mitigation projects, with the remaining 24% going to adaptation. Of the total financing provided by the multilateral climate funds to the region, 51% took the form of concessional loans, while 47% was provided as grants. For the region, approvals in the 2015–2016 period were concentrated in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Colombia, where large-scale mitigation projects were launched supported by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). For the period 2003–2019, the total contribution of climate financing to SA and the Caribbean is about USD 3558 million. The largest contributors to climate financing in the region come from the GCF, which approved USD 824.2 million for 23 projects. Brazil is the top recipient with USD 195 million, followed by Argentina with about USD 162 million. The second provider is the Amazon Fund with USD 717 million allocated to 102 projects in Brazil. In 2018, the CTF became the third largest source of financing, with USD 483 million dollars approved for 24 projects; the main recipient is Chile with USD 16,207 million, followed by Colombia with USD 170 million. The five largest projects approved in the region in 2018 were through the GCF. Brazil (USD 195 million) received support for reducing energy consumption across Brazilian cities, while Argentina (USD 103 million) received support to scale up investments by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in renewable energy and energy efficiency. In both cases, financing is predominantly provided as concessional loans."

In SA and the Caribbean, 73% (USD 2579 million) of funding to date has supported mitigation. Only 21% (USD 761 million) of the funding supports adaptation projects, and the remaining 4% (USD 217 million) supports multi-focus projects. Of the 51 new projects in SA and the Caribbean approved in 2018–2019, the GCF financed USD 508 million over ten projects. Amazon Fund was next with USD 81 million for 10 projects. While the GCF focuses on large and transformative projects and programmes, and in connection with broader reform of the policy framework in the region, the Amazon Fund targets smaller project interventions."
wg2_ch12_12.5.8.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"Climate financing in the region is concentrated in Brazil, which receives a third of the region’s funding, with 41 mitigation activities receiving more than 6 times that of adaptation from multilateral climate funds. By the size of its GDP, Brazil receives the largest amount of financing; this leaves the poorest countries with little or no financing and therefore reinforces a vicious circle of poverty and vulnerability. Whether this is due to Brazil’s being more successful at presenting eligible projects, a lack of commitment from other developing countries or some other structural factors is an open question. In any case, compensation schemes for the most vulnerable countries appear as needed, given the differences in vulnerability to climate-related damage (Antimiani et al., 2017). This is aggravated by the fact that fund management is in the hands of supranational entities while inequalities remain in regions within a country, particularly in highly centralised countries, as is the case for countries in the region."

A key decision point for adaptation will be how the world responds to the pandemic. The global recovery can serve as a catalyst to increased and more equitable climate financing. Globally, recovery packages will likely have the power to change the global trajectory towards meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement and building a more just future (Forster et al., 2020). Several factors are relevant to the design of economic recovery packages: the long-run economic multiplier, contributions to the productive asset base and national wealth, speed of implementation, affordability, simplicity, impact on inequality and various political considerations (Hepburn et al., 2020). A key objective of any recovery package is to stabilise expectations, restore confidence and channel desired surplus savings into productive investment. However, ‘business as usual’ implies temperature increases over 3°C, implying great future uncertainty, instability and climate damage. An alternative way to restore confidence is to steer investment towards a productive and balanced portfolio of sustainable physical capital, human capital, social capital, intangible capital and natural capital assets (Zenghelis et al., 2020), consistent with global goals on climate change. Finally, any recovery package, including climate-friendly recovery, is unlikely to be implemented unless it also addresses existing societal and political concerns—such as poverty alleviation, inequality and social inclusion—which vary from country to country."

wg2_ch12_12.5.10.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"For agrifood systems, the adoption of agroforestry provides for more diverse and sustainable agricultural production, where farmers maintain or improve their current production by incorporating suitable trees that ameliorate climatic conditions. Thus, in the same unit of land, these systems incorporate exotic tree species or managed native forests into farming systems allowing for the simultaneous production of trees, crops and livestock with different spatial arrangements or temporal sequences. On the other hand, it is recognised that the initial investment and time until trees start to produce may create an economic vulnerability. Therefore, there is a need to design adequate programmes and allocate resources for agroforestry system implementation and technical assistance and training (medium confidence). Also, some market schemes such as PES and certification can help to reduce this vulnerability."
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"For the health sector, we assessed the barriers and facilitators for the implementation of climate-driven EWSs under natural extreme events and epidemic situations. We found institutional dimensions to be potential barriers. These included the legal and regulatory feasibility, institutional capacity and administrative feasibility, transparency and political acceptability (high confidence). The fewest barriers were identified for the economic and environmental dimensions."
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.2_p2,NO_TITLE,One of the main institutional challenges is the lack of policy with climate–health linkages. Opportunities include a national plan for the health sector to address the impacts of climate change by formalising collaborations via agreements memoranda of understanding (MOUs). Another key barrier is that relatively few institutions in the region have the human technical and administrative capacity to implement and operate an EWS. Regional platforms may provide a solution for technical assistance at national levels.
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"On the other hand, the economic dimensions faced relatively few barriers, although the initial costs of designing, implementing, equipping and maintaining the system are a potential barrier for health-related sectors with reduced budgets. However, the health benefits and economic savings (due to averted epidemics or damage from disasters) may offset these costs. The resilience built into the health sector by these systems may be applicable to other economic sectors that could benefit from the early warning of an immenent extreme event and associated health impacts."
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"For the water sector, geophysical and economic dimensions do not pose a major barrier thanks to the potential reduction of flood hazard exposure, physical-technical viability of project implementation, different suitable economic mechanisms for joint public-private financing and more efficient water use. However, limited institutional capacities and the social-environmental impacts of large water infrastructure (Section 12.5.3) reduce the institutional, social, environmental and, to some extent, technological feasibility. This may be a potential barrier to the adaptive approach of multi-use water storage (medium confidence)."
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"In the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem sector, we assessed the feasibility of implementing EbA options in the CSA region. Given that EbA encompasses a wide range of projects, techniques and political and socioeconomic arrangements, extreme care should be taken when applying these general findings to particular cases. EbA can enhance food sovereignty and carbon stocks and foster SDGs by protecting and restoring ecosystems’ health and productivity. EbA is a strategy that frequently involves bottom-up decision-making and local communities’ empowerment and usually contributes to inequality reduction. EbA tends to benefit vulnerable groups, but aspects such as the impact on socioeconomic inequalities when implemented should be taken into account."
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"In general, EbA does not require advanced technologies for local communities. However, limitations in technical assistance and funding for specific key technologies and training may act as a barrier for EbA adoption (medium confidence). EbA practices can reduce risk in several ways by increasing awareness among communities and providing food diversity and production. EbA is recognised as a desirable policy for most stakeholders in CSA, particularly because as a strategy it incorporates environmental and social concerns. Nonetheless, it is important that all stakeholders agree on the goals and methods for EbA to be effective. A lack of institutional coordination, clear goals and strategies were identified as a potential barrier for EbA implementation. EbA is heavily based in local and IK, as well as academic ecological knowledge."
wg2_ch12_12.5.10.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"For the adaptation options analysed, significant barriers and mixed effects were observed for the institutional dimension, which indicates the relevance of the design and implementation of public policies and institutional arrangements for effective adaptation in the region. Considering the results, there is a need to advance initiatives, programmes and projects that facilitate adaptation to climate change. In the same way, barriers were apparent in the technological dimension, which indicates the importance of increasing access and diffusion of appropriate techniques and technologies in order to face the challenges of climate change in the region."

wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"NbS are related to the maintenance, enhancement and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems as a means of addressing multiple concerns simultaneously (Kabisch et al., 2016). NbS can trigger sustainability transitions. For example, the conservation and restoration of natural ecosystems are prone to promote synergy between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. EbA can be seen as a type of NbS deployed in response to climate-change vulnerability and risk (Greenwalt et al., 2018), combining the objectives of reducing the vulnerability of human systems and increasing the resilience of natural systems (IPCC, 2014)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"The Municipal Quito District in Ecuador covers 4235 km 2 of mountainous territory that ranges from 500 to 5000 MASL. That territory has followed a pattern of urbanisation common in Latin America: its population has increased from around 500,000 people in the 1970s to nearly 3 million inhabitants by 2020, of which 80% live in urban areas (Municipio del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, 2016). A massive inflow of people immigrated in the early 1970s due to various causes, including the search for the rents created as a result of the oil boom in the Ecuadorian Amazon, better working conditions, health, education and cultural services, in comparison with the rural areas or in mid-sized cities. As a result, the city underwent exponential growth, claiming valuable agricultural and forestry areas, as well as natural ecosystems, in the peripheries. Many of the new neighbourhoods were established through land invasions or informal markets, in many cases over steep slopes, in water sources and agricultural or conservation areas (high confidence) (Cuvi, 2015; Gómez Salazar and Cuvi, 2016). That exponential population growth, coupled with urban sprawl, poses many challenges to the city, including those related to climate change."
wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p3,NO_TITLE,"Mean air temperature and annual rainfall (measured by instruments since 1891 and inferred through historical records of rogation ceremonies since 1600), are increasing, combined with an increase in seasonality (i.e., longer periods of drought) and extreme weather events, particularly higher levels of precipitation (Serrano Vincenti et al., 2017; Domínguez-Castro et al., 2018). Two impacts related to warmer air conditions are the displacement of the freezing line currently placed at 5100 MASL (Basantes-Serrano et al., 2016), followed by glacier retreat and the upward displacement of mountainous ecosystems (very high confidence) (Vuille et al., 2018; Cuesta et al., 2019). The key ecosystem that regulates water provision for the city is the paramo, and only about 5% of this process is related to glaciers, so the combined effects of climate change on both systems, coupled with land use change and fires, can reduce the availability of water for agriculture, human consumption and hydropower. Other important climatic hazards and impacts are the increase of solar radiation, the heat island effect and fires (high confidence) (Anderson et al., 2011; Armenteras et al., 2020; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). On almost half of the days of each year, Quito’s population is exposed to levels of UV radiation above 11 according to the World Health Organization scale (Municipio del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, 2016)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"Various policies, programmes and projects have been created for the promotion of urban green spaces, protected areas, water source and watershed monitoring, conservation and ecosystem restoration, air pollution monitoring and control and urban agriculture. Among those actions, three recent ones are commonly highlighted. The first is the FONAG, established in 2000 with funds from national and international organisations to promote the protection of the water basins that supply most of the drinking water. It is a PES scheme enabled through a public–private escrow. The projects include conservation, ecological restoration and environmental education for a new culture of water, in a context opposed to the commodification of natural resources (Kauffman, 2014; Bremer et al., 2016; Coronel T, 2019). FONAG was innovative in the use of trust funds in a voluntary, decentralised mechanism and has inspired more than 21 other water funds in the region; nevertheless, its narrative of success has also been said to oversimplify and misrepresent some complex interactions between stakeholders as well as within communities and their land management practices (Joslin, 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"The second highlighted initiative is the AGRUPAR (Participatory Urban Agriculture) programme, launched as a public initiative in 2002 initially with international cooperation funds. It was aimed at providing assistance to poorer urban and peri-urban populations, to initiate and manage orchards as well as domestic animals such as chickens and guinea pigs, with the goal of promoting self-sustenance and commerce. AGRUPAR provides and finances training, seeds and seedlings, greenhouses, certifications and marketing support and spaces where farmers can sell directly their products to consumers. In 2016, AGRUPAR gave assistance to more than 4000 farmers managing orchards of various scales that combined produce, more than 500 tonnes annually. The programme has direct impacts on nutrition, generation of work for women, production of healthy food, reduction of runoff, recycling of organic waste and social cohesion, among others (very high confidence)  (Thomas, 2014; Cuvi, 2015; Rodríguez-Dueñas and Rivera, 2016; Clavijo Palacios and Cuvi, 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"A third initiative is the creation of a municipal system of protected areas, locally named Áreas de Conservación y Uso Sustentable (ACUS). This system covers an area of 1320 km², nearly a third of the Municipal Quito District. Half of this landscape (680 km 2) is covered by montane forests and paramos  (Torres and Peralvo, 2019). These forests provide direct water, food and fibres for about 20,000 people and indirectly a rural landscape for a growing number of urban citizens and foreign tourists that practice ecotourism and look for fresh and healthy food. During the last three decades, this area has witnessed a high density of public and private conservation and restoration efforts that aim to regain ecological integrity and improve human well-being in deforested and degraded landscapes (Mansourian, 2017; Zalles, 2018; Wiegant et al., 2020). Quito’s system of protected areas constitutes a primary strategy for fostering links between urban and rural citizens as a means of understanding the ecological dependence of urban metropolises to their surrounding natural landscapes. Along the same lines, these areas constitute a key element to increase the adaptive capacity of rural livelihoods and contribute to mitigating climate change through landscape restoration, sustainable production and forest conservation (high confidence)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Other NbS actions include the restoration of small basins, locally called quebradas, under different schemes of management and participation (medium evidence, very high agreement ) (da Cruz e Sousa and Ríos-Touma, 2018) and the transformation since 2013 of a large portion of the old Quito airport into an urban park. Nevertheless, Quito city continues to face challenges in the social, economic, infrastructural and environmental spheres. A major pending environmental issue is air pollution; a high level of pollutants affects the city in general and especially the most vulnerable groups (high confidence) (Zalakeviciute et al., 2018; Alvarez-Mendoza et al., 2019; Estrella et al., 2019; Hernandez et al., 2019; Rodríguez-Guerra and Cuvi, 2019). Another major issue is the continuous sprawl of new neighbourhoods, mainly through informal processes, that diminish urban resilience because of the destruction of conservation and food production areas, sources of water and the dispersion of settlements without primary services, among other consequences (Gómez Salazar and Cuvi, 2016)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"Amazonian dark earths (ADEs), also known as Terras Pretas de Índio, are anthropogenic soils derived from the activities associated with the settlements and agricultural practices of pre-Hispanic societies in the Amazon (Woods and McCann, 1999; Lehmann et al., 2003; Sombroek et al., 2003). Most of the ADEs identified so far are 500 to 2500 years old (de Souza et al., 2019). According to Maezumi et al. (2018a), polyculture agroforestry allowed for the development of complex societies in the eastern Amazon around 4500 years ago. Agroforestry was combined with the cultivation of multiple crops and the active and progressive increase in the proportion of edible plant species in the forest, along with hunting and fishing. The formation of ADEs as a result of these activities served as the basis for a food production system that supported a growing human population in the area (Maezumi et al., 2018a)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"ADEs are the result of the accumulation and incomplete combustion of waste materials such as ceramic artefacts and organic residues from harvesting, weeding, food processing (including cooking) and other activities (Lima et al., 2002; Hecht, 2003; Kämpf et al., 2003). ADEs are characterised by their increased fertility in relation to adjacent soils, with high contents of organic carbon (C) (mainly as charcoal) as well as inorganic nutrients, especially phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) and high carbon/nitrogen ratios (high confidence) (Moline and Coutinho, 2015; Alho et al., 2019; Barbosa et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). They also exhibit a high cation exchange capacity and moisture retention, among other properties (Hecht, 2003; Kämpf et al., 2003; Falcão et al., 2009). Charcoal content is a key indicator of pre-Hispanic fire activity and sedentary occupation, which is evidence of the anthropic origin of these soils (high confidence) (Hecht, 2017; Maezumi et al., 2018b; Alho et al., 2019; Barbosa et al., 2020; Iriarte et al., 2020; Montoya et al., 2020; Shepard et al., 2020)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Accumulation of organic residues and low-intensity fire management are recognised key elements in ADE formation. ADEs originating around settlements show a relatively high density of ceramic artefacts and are called terras pretas . They present a higher content of calcium and phosphorus than those originating from agricultural activities, which are known as terras mulatas (Hecht, 2003)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"There is a robust and growing body of research from various disciplines that assigns a high relevance to ADEs in the region. It has been shown through archaeological and palaeoclimatic data that Amazonian societies that based their agricultural management on Terras Pretas de Índio were more resilient to the changing climate due to increased soil fertility and water retention capacity (de Souza et al., 2019). Additionally, low organic carbon degradability over long time periods, associated with high contents of charcoal or pyrogenic carbon, makes these soils an important C sink (medium confidence: robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Lehmann et al., 2003; Guo, 2016; Trujillo et al., 2020), which is particularly relevant in an area like the Amazon, that could change from a net carbon sink to a net carbon source as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change (Maezumi et al., 2018b)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"The Indigenous agricultural practices that led to ADEs are thought to be associated with a more sedentary agricultural model than the current slash-and-burn and shifting cultivation practices. Although this is a controversial topic, as the precise definitions of slash and burn and shifting cultivation are presently under discussion (Hecht, 2003), several present-day local and Indigenous agricultural practices, including in-field burning and nutrient additions from food processing and residue management, have been recognised as promoting high organic carbon and nutrient soil contents similar to those found in ADEs (Hecht, 2003; Winklerprins, 2009)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"At present, ADEs are estimated to cover up to 3.2% of the Amazon basin and are highly valued for their persistent fertility, and they have become a key resource for sustainable agriculture for Amazon communities in a climate-change context (Altieri and Nicholls, 2013; Maezumi et al., 2018a; de Souza et al., 2019). Based on the lessons learned from the Terras Pretas de Índio, some researchers have proposed the development of technologies to promote a new generation of anthropogenic soils (e.g., Kern et al. 2009; Lehmann 2009; Schmidt et al. 2014; Bezerra et al. 2016; Kern et al. 2019). Among the technologies based on ADE findings, biochar, obtained by the slow pyrolysis of agricultural residues, is the most explored application found in the literature (Mohan et al., 2018; Matoso et al., 2019; Amoah-Antwi et al., 2020). The dual purpose of increased soil fertility and carbon sequestration is considered an important goal in connection with developing sustainable agriculture in a climate-change context (Kern et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"Preservation of the practices and knowledge associated with these soils is vital for sustainable agriculture in a climate-change scenario in the Amazon. It will greatly contribute to the preservation of valuable IK as well as the contribution to the development of new adaptation and mitigation technologies, among other unexplored solutions."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"Lima-Callao Metropolitan Area, capital of Perú, is facing recurrent climate disasters providing lessons on water-related climate-proof governance reconfiguration. The first lesson is that when disasters affect poor and rich populations, dominant actors prioritise the integral city’s resilience and development and coordinate and collaborate within a concertation framework across institutional levels and geographical scales (Hommes and Boelens, 2017; Miranda Sara, 2021), even having different ideas, discourses, and power, recognising that no single actor has enough power. Second, water-related climate-change scenarios require comprehensive, transverse, multi-sectoral, multi-scalar, multiple types of actor knowledge (expert, tacit, codified and contextual embedded) (Pfeffer, 2018) and transparent information to manage the tensions and even conflicts when some knowledge is not shared or restricted, particularly when lower risk perception and higher risk tolerance are present. Finally, a concertative (processes involving a variety of actors, which has become mandatory in Peru) strategy to localise climate-changed-related action shows quicker, more effective and more transparent results (medium confidence, robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; Pepermans and Maeseele, 2016; Siña et al., 2016; Miranda Sara et al., 2017)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"As the second driest city in the world, Lima is highly vulnerable to drought and heavy rainfall in the nearby Andean highlands (Schütze et al., 2019). Located on the Pacific coast with more than 10 million inhabitants, it suffers from flooding, mudslide disasters and water stress, and is more frequently affected by heavy rain peak events (1970, 1987, 1998, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2017) (very high confidence) (Mesclier et al., 2015; Miranda Sara et al., 2016; French and Mechler, 2017; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2017; Escalante Estrada and Miranda, 2020). In addition to unequal water distribution in quantity and pricing, one million inhabitants lack water connections (Ioris, 2016; Miranda Sara et al., 2017; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2017) as a result of a lack of long-term city planning and lack of integration with water and risk management. Climate-change scenarios were ignored or denied, particularly when budget allocations for preventive actions were necessary (high confidence) (Miranda Sara et al., 2016; Allen et al., 2017a)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"In 2014, the water company (SEDAPAL), together with the Lima Metropolitan Municipality (LMM), National Water Authority (ANA) and other organisations, agreed on a Lima Action Plan for Water (Schütze et al., 2019). The same year, the LMM approved a climate change strategy defining adaptation and mitigation measures (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014) based on technical and scientific action research within interactive and iterative concertation multi-actor processes."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"However, in 2015, municipal elections shifted Lima’s and, later, Peru’s political power to parties associated with climate deniers at a high cost to the people, city infrastructure and housing. In early 2017, buildings along rivers, ravines and slopes suffered from floods, huaycos (mudslides), and the whole city experienced potable water cuts (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2017) and vector-borne diseases affecting especially poorer but also richer inhabitants."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"A so-called coastal El Niño affected the whole country, and as a consequence, in 2018 the Peruvian government passed the Framework Law for Climate Change, Law No. 30754, a unique political decision, to assure the integration of climate-change concerns in public policies and investment projects. The law defines local government mandates on local climate action plans. The 2019 municipal elections brought new local authorities to Lima, and by 2020, 19 district municipalities had developed adaptation measures, adopting the metropolitan climate change strategy with support from Cities for Life Foro and GIZ (Foro Ciudades Para la Vida, 2021). In 2021, LMM approved its local climate change plan (LCCP), and 10 (out of 51 with Callao) more municipalities finalised their LCCP with the support of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and the European Union."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"The institutionalised culture of participation in Peru did lead to a broader concept of concertation, wherein practices of collaborative planning were developed to allow actors to build up socially supported agreements and decisions and take action without losing sight of their principles. These processes have been applied to reduce risks, to adapt and to anticipate uncertain and unknown futures; they also introduced climate-change concerns within a complex political and institutional environment surrounded by corruption scandals (Vergara, 2018; Durand, 2019) and growing political polarisation."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p7,NO_TITLE,"Several processes have been set in motion to engage citizen participation and promote climate action planning. First, the LMM with Climate Action Plan processes reopened the Climate Change Technical Group of the Municipal Environmental Commission, whose work ended in the approval of the Lima Local Action Plan of Climate Change (MML, 2021). Second, the River Basin Council is developing the River Basin Management Plan led by the National Water Authority.Finally, the Metropolitan Lima Urban Development Plan is finalising a citizen consultation, with the support of a high-level consultation group."
wg2_ch12_12.6.3_p8,NO_TITLE,"Such processes include heated discussions, conflicts and the recognition of other discourses and types of knowledge so as to build up scenarios that ‘visualise’ and anticipate what might happen. These processes require democratic, transparent and decentralised institutions, providing clear mandates and strong political will to support them, so that the poor and vulnerable can make their views known and are able to make themselves heard, even if their power remains limited (Chu et al., 2016). Opportunities for the reconfiguration of sociopolitical and technological water governance are emerging based on socially supported agreements (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; Miranda Sara, 2021). However, the water governance configuration faces the paradox that the current water demands of all users combined may no longer be feasible within ecological limits and future climate-change consequences (Miranda Sara et al., 2016; Schütze et al., 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Guatemala experiences high climate interannual variability, now increased from the effect of climate change (INSIVUMEH, 2018; Bardales et al., 2019). Impacts on human settlements, agriculture and ecosystems result from both excess and reduced precipitation (high confidence) (Section 12.3.1.4). Guerra (2016) argues that deficient IWRM in the country is the main reason for those impacts. A case in point is that of the Madre Vieja and Achiguate rivers, where an intense El Niño event triggered dryer conditions and, in turn, a crisis and conflict that reached national proportions. Progress in local water governance helped to solve that crisis and helped tackle challenges posed by reduced precipitation and flood risk in southern Guatemala."
wg2_ch12_12.6.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"The ENSO event that started in November 2014 and ended in July 2016 (CIIFEN, 2016) was the most intense since records commenced in 1950 (NOAA, 2019). Its effects were felt in different parts of the world, and Guatemala and the rest of CA experienced intense water scarcity due to a significant reduction in rainfall (high confidence) (IICA, 2015; Scientific American, 2015). River flow in the dry months is related to precipitation levels in the previous rainy season, so ENSO has an effect on river flow rates. Two of the main rivers in the Pacific coast of Guatemala, Madre Vieja and Achiguate, dried out completely at the beginning of 2016, triggering a nearly violent local conflict that caught the attention of national leaders (Guerra, 2016; Gobernación de Escuintla et al., 2017). In addition to the severe drought, the rivers dried because of overextraction by multiple users (60 in the case of Madre Vieja). This had happened before to a lesser extent in the last 20 years during the critical months of the dry season. A lack of regulation, coordination mechanisms, information and other elements of water governance was the root cause of the problem, exacerbated by the drier conditions during the intense El Niño event, resulting in the intensification of an existing conflict (high confidence) (Guerra, 2016)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.4_p3,NO_TITLE,"Roundtables were set up to foster dialogue between numerous stakeholders, including communities, agri-export companies, governmental organisations and municipalities, all led by the local governor (Gobernación de Escuintla et al., 2017). Agreements included keeping a minimum river flow all the way to the sea, setting up a monitoring and verification system for levels of river flow and restoring riparian forests. A system was set up to monitor river flow at different points along the rivers on a daily basis in the dry season using a simple WhatsApp-based system to communicate the warnings and monitor compliance. Four years on, the rivers had not dried out and conflict was kept to a minimum. Rural communities can use rivers for recreational purposes and for fishing all year round, while plantations (large and small) can use water for irrigation (rationally) and keep producing. Similar schemes and interactions started happening in other rivers in the Pacific coast of Guatemala, with positive results, in particular, rivers kept flowing all through the dry season, as can be seen in the report of river flows for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 (ICC, 2019b)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"A key actor in the improvement of water governance has been the private Institute for Climate Change Research (ICC). This is a unique initiative that was created in 2010 and is funded primarily by the private sector of Guatemala to help the country advance in climate-change mitigation and adaptation (Guerra, 2014). The institute works alongside local governments, communities and private companies in several areas besides integrated water management. Its role is merely technical-scientific: it oversees the water monitoring system, generating data on weather and hydrology and providing support to other stakeholders."
wg2_ch12_12.6.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"Local governance was also essential for the implementation of flood risk management actions (high confidence). Guerra et al. (2017) explained how impacts were significantly reduced in the Coyolate River watershed, as well as on the Pacific coast of Guatemala, thanks to flood protection that was designed and implemented in a technical and integrated manner. This was a result of the strong and active participation of local communities, companies and the local municipality, which demanded that the central government invest effectively. The stakeholders provided some resources (financial and in-kind) and inspected the works. Some flat areas of the lower Coyolate watershed used to flood annually, causing economic damage in communities. The areas covered by flood risk measures have not flooded and so have avoided losses and created conditions that attract investment and create jobs, improving living conditions for the locals. Other processes of participation and interaction between the authorities, the private sector and communities have taken place in other watersheds for planning, action and investment in connection with flood risk management. The ICC has played a role by studying flood-prone areas, building capacities in communities, fostering public–private coordination mechanisms and providing much needed technical assistance to local governments (ICC, 2019a)."
wg2_ch12_12.6.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Although some may argue that water governance is in the realm of development, it has made contributions in reducing direct and indirect impacts of climate events and, therefore, can be seen as a key element for climate adaptation (high confidenc e)."
wg2_ch12_12.7_p1,NO_TITLE,"Data deficiencies and heterogeneity in quantity, quality and geographical bias in knowledge limit people’s understanding of climate change, evaluation of its impacts and the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures (Harvey et al., 2018) in CSA. The number of publications is not representative of the sensitivity to climate change and vulnerability contexts of different sub-regions and sectors. This lack of representation in the mainstream literature may lead to a bias and, therefore, an underestimation of the overall climate-related impact for some CSA sub-regions (Sietsma et al., 2021). The reason for the relatively few quantitative studies might be the complexities of socio-demographic and economic factors and the lack of long-term and reliable data in these areas (Harvey et al., 2018), along with other social, economic and technical constraints."
wg2_ch12_12.7_p2,NO_TITLE,"Most studies that assess vulnerability to climate change do not yet follow the concept adopted since AR5, which isolates exposure as an external variable (WGII AR5 Figure SPM 1) (IPCC, 2014), and many still use the A and B system of climate-change scenarios from AR4, because the adoption of the RCP models has been slow. There is still limited literature on severe risks and little specific and explicit consideration of risk drivers in the region. Moreover, limits to adaptation and the effectiveness of adaptation measures in CSA remain largely understudied."
wg2_ch12_12.7_p3,NO_TITLE,"Research on the interactions between climate change and socioeconomic processes is not extensive (Barnes et al., 2013; Leichenko and O’Brien, 2019; Thomas et al., 2019). There is limited understanding of the multi-level synergistic effects of climate change and other drivers, including economic development from the household to the country level (Wilbanks and Kates, 2010; Leichenko and Silva, 2014; Tanner et al., 2015a; Carey et al., 2017). In the region, this deficit is greater for sectors other than agriculture, water and food."
wg2_ch12_12.7.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"The knowledge gaps in the eight sub-regions are quite heterogeneous. In CA, climate-change research is notably insufficient in all sectors included in this report, considering that climatic change, variability and extremes are impacting and will continue to severely impact this sub-region, and the vulnerability of the social and natural systems is high. Data deficiencies must be overcome as renewed research on climate change updates models, scenarios and projected impacts across sectors and levels (i.e., household to country). In NWS, there is a lack of studies on the relationships with increased fire events, and the impacts on the infrastructure of all kinds, on certain lowland, marine and coastal ecosystems and on ecosystem functioning and the provision of environmental services. Experimental studies are rare and most necessary to identify critical ecological thresholds to support decision-making processes, linking glacier retreat to its consequences on biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with different land use trajectories. Complex interactions with processes such as peace agreements in Colombia are yet to be investigated (Salazar et al., 2018). In NSA, there remains a limited amount of peer-reviewed literature addressing the implications of climate change on Indigenous cultures and their livelihoods. In SAM, further data are needed on the vulnerability of traditional populations, impacts on water availability and soil degradation, risks to biodiversity and resilience of ecosystems in connection with climate change."
wg2_ch12_12.7.1_p2,NO_TITLE,"There is a knowledge gap about the likely impact of climate change on NES biodiversity, soil degradation and best adaptation measures. SES is the most urbanised sub-region of CSA, but there are severe knowledge deficits related to the design, implementation and evaluation of adaptation policy plans with respect to climate change. Forecasts related to risk prevention require new studies that address down-scaled climate-change models with concrete solutions to increase cities’ resilience. In SWS, there is a lack of long-term studies addressing climate-change impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, which is mainly due to the lack of integrated observational systems. There is a lack of studies projecting future impacts of climate change on the cryosphere, water resources, hazards, risks and disasters on natural and human systems. This is mainly due to the lack of systematic documentation, analysis and evaluation of adaptation strategies adopted, as well as their limitations and the lessons learned from maladaptation processes. There is scant evidence about transformational adaptation to climate change and system resilience. In SSA, there is a need for information related to the cities’ vulnerability to climate change and the impacts of the direct effects of future climate change on cities, energy infrastructure and health. Also, there is a knowledge gap about the financing of climate-change adaptation in SSA."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.1_p1,NO_TITLE,"Advances in scientific knowledge on the risks of climate-change impacts and the vulnerability and resilience of ecosystems to climate change are needed (Bustamante et al., 2020). Persistent climate change in tropical rainforests requires deeper study and understanding, overall in connection with the role of nutrients, deep-water availability and biodiversity. Further research is needed to understand feedback to climate systems of large-scale changes in the land surface in SA biomes. The region has important freshwater Global 200 Ecoregions, including the Orinoco River and Flooded Forests, Upper Amazon River and streams, and Amazon River and Flooded Forests, which represent a priority for freshwater biodiversity conservation at a global scale (Manes et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Paper 1; Figure 12.8). There is, however, a clear knowledge gap on the impacts of climate change on freshwater biodiversity in the region (Section CCP1.2.3; Manes et al., 2021). Lastly, more interdisciplinary research is needed regarding conservation strategies and stable financial resources focusing on adaptation of ecosystems in the region (Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019)."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.2_p1,NO_TITLE,"There is an important lack of knowledge about the state of health of the ocean and coastal ecosystems along CSA (i.e., social-ecological data integration, poor sampling efforts, lack of information about the value of ecosystem services, lack of information about ecosystems cover and distribution, lack of studies about climate-change perceptions and social concerns), including marine fisheries (i.e., landing statistics not available, lack of reliable information on the scope of resource extraction, among others). Poor or absent monitoring programmes (physical, environmental and biological variables) that feed alert and surveillance systems are lacking in CSA. There is a general absence of a continuous line of scientific research or adequate baseline information about the impacts of climate change, as well as continuous monitoring of the adaptation plans adopted in ocean and coastal ecosystems that limit the formulation of adequate conservation and management programmes. When studies are performed, inadequate access to data limits the analyses of the existing information, making difficult to detect climate-change trends and impacts and develop effective adaptation strategies."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.3_p1,NO_TITLE,"As in other sectors and environmental systems, for the water sector there are important limitations in terms of monitoring and data collection. High-quality, long-term hydrological data are unevenly available for different sub-regions and limit the possibility of obtaining a deeper understanding of changes in river runoff and lake or groundwater changes. Groundwater data are particularly scarce. There are important gaps related to the projections of water resources for the future. Much of current knowledge on future changes in water resources and water scarcity and flood risks is based on information from global-scale studies because studies specific to this region are scarce. Several elements that are important for IWRM, such as water quality, water demand, privatisation and other economic dynamics, and nutrient, pollutant and sediment flux are poorly known currently due to missing data and insufficient efforts to monitor them."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.4_p1,NO_TITLE,"Integrative evaluation on impacts on food security, including agricultural production, distribution and access, leading to adaptation strategies is limited within the region. Limited information regarding cost-benefit analyses of adaptation in the food production sector is available in the region. It is also important to obtain a better understanding of adaptation effects to avoid maladaptation and promote site-specific and dynamic adaptation options considering available technologies. Compiling and systematising existing scientific and local knowledge on the relationship between forests, land cover/use and hydrological services is a gap that must be filled from a broader perspective in the region, which could contribute to formulating recommendations and inform restoration practices and policies. The literature also highlights widespread gaps between farmers’ information needs and services that are routinely available. There is evidence that when climate information services are created with farmer input and targeted in a timely and inclusive manner, they are a positive determinant of adaptation through the adoption of more resilient farm-level practices. However, current assessments of the economic impacts of climate information services are scarce; hence, more such studies are needed."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.5_p1,NO_TITLE,"Despite the high level of urbanisation in the region, studies on urban adaptation initiatives are still underreported by municipalities, and several practical results have not yet been demonstrated (Araos et al., 2016). This issue is particularly relevant to medium-sized cities because most of the literature and data available on adaptation refer to the major capital cities. The potential of applying new resilient parameters in building and land use regulations for adaptation is underreported. The same can be said about the impact of housing improvement and slum upgrading on climate resilience, even when initiatives are focused on reducing environmental and climate risk. Also relevant in the region is a gap in research about NbS applied to urban area adaptation, as in the case of the urban forestry potential for adaptation (Barona et al., 2020). Even though the importance of urban ecological infrastructure in providing ecosystem services, such as flood control, is reasonably well documented, its practical application in urban planning in CSA remains limited (Romero-Duque et al., 2020). Added to this is the lack of monitoring data on adaptation initiatives in general and, in particular, on adaptation initiatives in water systems that have already been implemented and their effects on risk reduction. A lack of monitoring data contributes to the lack of information about maladaptation in urban areas and its consequences. Mobility and transport system adaptation options remained virtually entirely unexplored, while mitigation options receive significant attention."

A systematic multi-scalar analysis of the impact of CVC on human health is needed across distinct social-ecological contexts. Data collection systems need to be strengthened to accurately estimate the burden of mortality and morbidity from heat and extreme events. The data deficit is a common problem in functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems, including lack of information on causes of death (UNEP, 2018). In addition, there is a lack of consensus on globally accepted and operational definitions for both climate-related extremes and exposures/outcomes."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.6_p5,NO_TITLE,"For infectious disease (vector-borne and water-borne), the technology available to estimate current and future risk areas is often limited by human or financial resource constraints in developing countries. There is a geographical mismatch between the areas producing the technology and knowledge (in the global north) and the areas most affected by CVC (in the global south). User-friendly tools that bring together climate and health information—without the need for modelling or GIS expertise—are needed for health sector decision makers."
wg2_ch12_12.7.2.6_p6,NO_TITLE,"There is a lack of studies that assess the feasibility of health adaptation measures (Section 12.5.10), thereby limiting the ability of decision makers to compare different health interventions and identify bottlenecks for implementation.

There is a need to better understand how poor and vulnerable communities are affected and the more effective ways to prevent it. The large majority of the poor in the region are living in urban areas (UNDESA, 2019); extreme urban poverty is increasingly more relevant, including the needs and priorities of informal settlements and economies, but less studied within the interaction with climate change. There is little reporting of major adaptation options implemented by or for vulnerable and poor urban dwellers (Ryan and Bustos, 2019; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021)."

Poverty and extreme poverty rates are higher among children, young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and migrant and rural populations, but urban extreme poverty is also growing (very high confidence). Socioeconomic challenges are being intensified by the COVID crisis. Most countries in CA are already ranked as the highest risk level worldwide due to the region’s high vulnerability to climate change and low adaptive capacity; the lack of climate data and proper downscaling are challenging the adaptation process (high confidence)."

In CA, 10.5 million people are living in the so-called Dry Corridor, a region with an extended dry season and, now, more erratic rainfall patterns. A water crisis in Brazil affected the major cities of the country between 2014 and 2016, having become more frequent since then. Severe droughts have also been reported in Paraguay and Argentina. In contrast, the urbanised areas of NSA are highly exposed to extreme floods (41% of urban population in the Amazon Delta and Estuary).

The constant loss of assets and livelihoods in both urban and rural areas drives communities into chronic poverty traps, exacerbating local poverty cycles and creating new ones."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.1_p4,NO_TITLE,"For instance, climate-related reduced yields in crops, fisheries and aquaculture have a substantial impact on the livelihoods and food security of families and affect their options for coping with and adapting to climate change and variability. The impact of climate change in agriculture for CSA depends on determinants such as the availability of natural resources, access to markets, diversity of inputs and production methods, quality and coverage of infrastructure and socioeconomic characteristics of the population. Impacts from climate change on small-scale farmers compromise the livelihoods and food security of rural areas and, consequently, the food supply for urban areas."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.1_p5,NO_TITLE,"Governments in the region have implemented several poverty-reduction programmes. However, policies of income redistribution and poverty alleviation do not necessarily improve climate risk management, so complementary policies integrating both social and material conditions are required. A study in northern Brazil showed that risk management strategies for droughts and food insecurity did not change poverty rates between 1997–1998 and 2011–2012. Major shocks, such as climate and extreme weather events (e.g., floods, heavy rains, droughts, frost), reduce and destroy public and private property. For instance, the ENSO event of 2017 in Peru caused losses estimated between USD 6 and 9 billion, affected more than a million inhabitants and generated 370,000 new poor. In total, losses by unemployment, deaths, destruction and damage to infrastructure and houses were around 1.3% of the GDP of Peru."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.1_p6,NO_TITLE,"Low government spending on social infrastructure (e.g., health, education), ethnic discrimination and social exclusion reduce healthcare access, leaving poor people in entire regions mostly undiagnosed or untreated. In a context of privatisation policies of healthcare systems, research shows that marginal people lack identifying documents needed to access public services in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Mexico City (Mexico) and Santiago de Chile (Chile), some of the most developed cities in the region. The consequences of this situation are underreporting, low diagnosis and low treatment of diseases such as vector-borne diseases such as dengue and risk of diarrhoeal diseases originating from frequent flooding in Amazonian riverine communities. Bias in reporting on access to healthcare and the incidence of diseases in marginal populations is usually region-dependent. For example, in Brazil’s Amazonian north in 2018, there were 2.2 medical doctors per 1000 inhabitants, while 4.95 medical doctors per 1000 inhabitants and 9.52 doctors in São Paulo and Santa Catarina respectively. Another example is pregnant women in remote Amazonian municipalities, who receive less prenatal care than women in urban areas. These social inequities underlie systemic biases in health data quality, hindering reliable estimation of disease burdens such as the distribution of disease or birth and death registrations. For example, in Guatemala, alternative Indigenous healthcare systems are responding to local needs in Mayan communities. However, this remains unrecognised. The existence of health institutions based on IK can reinforce the lack of universal coverage by central government healthcare, addressing the miscalculation of morbidity, mortality and cause of death among disadvantaged groups."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.1_p7,NO_TITLE,"Inequality, informality and precariousness are particularly relevant barriers to adaptation. A significant part of the construction sector in the region is informal and does not follow regulations for land use and construction safety codes, and there is a lack of public strategies for housing access. Adaptive construction is based on up-to-date regulation and codes, appropriate design and materials, and access to infrastructure and services. Decreasing inequality and eradicating poverty are crucial for achieving proper adaptation to climate change in the region. Some anti-poverty initiatives, such as savings groups, microfinance for improving housing or assets and community enterprises, may also support specific adaptive measures. These mechanisms should be widely accessible to poor groups and be complemented by comprehensive poverty alleviation programmes that include climate-change adaptation."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p2,NO_TITLE,"CSA is the second most urbanised region in the world after North America, with 81% of its population being urban. In addition, 129 secondary cities with 500,000 inhabitants are home to half of the region’s urban population (222 million). Another 65 million people live in megacities of over 10 million each. The population migrates among cities, resulting in more secondary cities and creating mega regions and urban corridors."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p3,NO_TITLE,"Rapid growth in cities has increased the urban informal housing sector (e.g., slums, marginal human settlements and others), which increased from 6% to 26% of the total residences from 1990 to 2015. Coastal areas in CSA increasingly concentrate more urban centres. Researchers indicate that between 3 and 4 million inhabitants will experience coastal flooding and erosion from SLR in all emission scenarios by 2100 considering South America alone."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p4,NO_TITLE,"A study on cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants showed that the number of coastal cities significantly increased from 42 to 420 between 1945 and 2014; they are located close to fragile ecosystems such as bays, estuaries and mangrove forests, resulting in higher concentrations of population and economic activities. This process degraded the ability of coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, to reduce risks and provide essential ecosystem services, which help to prevent coastal erosion or maintain fish stocks. Moreover, it reduced ports and tourism, along with income opportunities."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p5,NO_TITLE,"Climate-change impacts on cities in CSA are strongly influenced by ENSO, which is associated with an increase in more-extreme rainfall events. Urban areas are increasingly dealing with floods, landslides, storms, TCs, water stress, fires, spread of vector-borne and infectious diseases, damaging infrastructure, economic activities, built and natural environments and the population’s overall well-being."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p6,NO_TITLE,"Glacier retreat in the mountains will affect water runoff and water provision to metropolitan areas such as Lima, La Paz, Quito and Santiago, which rely on rivers that originate in the high Andes. Lima, the second driest capital city in the world, is vulnerable to drought and heavy rain peak events associated with climate change. In Bogota, lower precipitation levels and a tendency towards increasing extreme events are expected in the coming decades. Hence, the protection of fragile ecosystems such as paramo (fields at 3000 to 4000 MASL) will be crucial for supplying water to the city."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p7,NO_TITLE,"SLR impacts cities located in LECZs, not only because of direct coastal flooding, coastal erosion and subsidence, but also because it aggravates the impact of storm surges, heat wave energy and saltwater intrusion. In Suriname and Guyana 68% and 31% of the population respectively live below 5 MASL, while many sectors of Georgetown, the capital of Guyana, are below sea level. Floods with increased frequency and severity of storm surges will also impact the River Plate estuary and lower delta of the Parana River where metropolitan Buenos Aires is located."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p8,NO_TITLE,"Over 80% of losses associated with climate-related risks are concentrated in urban areas, and between 40% and 70% of losses occur in cities with less than 100,000 inhabitants, most likely as a result of limited capacities to manage disaster risks and low levels of investment."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p9,NO_TITLE,"Despite consistent political and economic barriers, many cities in the region have adopted sustainable local development agendas, which work to bring about balanced urban development. The shortcomings of poor development patterns remain prominently on display in cities and present important obstacles to adaptation investment, as public investment in basic needs (mainly housing and sanitation) must be prioritised."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p10,NO_TITLE,"Cities struggle to address the immediate needs of their population while addressing longer-term needs associated with climate adaptation, emissions reduction and sustainable development. Some cities are moving forward to transformative adaptation, addressing drivers of vulnerability, building robust systems and anticipating impacts. Besides government-led adaptation planning and action, individuals, communities and enterprises have been incrementally adapting to climate change autonomously over time. Municipalities from Argentina, Peru, Chile, Equator, Brazil and Costa Rica are developing and implementing their Local Climate Action Plans, experimenting with and revealing best practices in adaptation. Both anticipatory adaptation measures—choosing safe locations, building structurally safe houses, choosing elevated places to store valuables, building on stilts—and reactive adaptation measures are used, the latter incorporating measures such as relocation, slope stabilisation, afforestation and greening of riverbanks. With variations, these cities have included mechanisms to work across sectors and actors on the understanding that it is collective planning and actions that will ensure that long-term programmes continue independently of particular city administrations."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.2_p11,NO_TITLE,"Cities are interconnected systems operating beyond administrative boundaries. Improved collaboration and coordination are needed for integrated responses. Aside from good planning, cities need access to external adaptation funds. Climate-change adaptation requires long-term funding and investments, which are beyond cyclical political considerations. It is crucial to rethink how to ensure that international adaptation funds will reach cities and innovate. For example, member cities of Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy in the region, together with Cities for Life Forum in Peru, the Red Argentina de Municipios por el Cambio Climático (RAMCC), the Capital Cities of the Americas facing Climate Change (CC35) and others, are pursuing this goal and applying directly for international grants. New funding sources are required to help local governments and civil society. Cities and locally driven adaptation initiatives can be funded by national governments and international organisations."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.3_p2,NO_TITLE,"The migration, voluntary and involuntary, of individuals, families and groups is common in CSA. People migrate nationally and internationally, temporarily or permanently, predominantly from rural areas—often immersed in poverty—to urban areas. Common social drivers of migration in the region are the economy, politics, land tenure and land management change, lack of access to markets, lack of infrastructure, and violence; environmental drivers include loss of water, crops and livestock, land degradation and sudden or gradual onset of climate hazards."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.3_p3,NO_TITLE,"The increasing frequency and magnitude of droughts, tropical storms, hurricanes and heavy rains producing landslides and floods have amplified internal movements, overall rural to urban. For instance, rural-to-urban migration in northern Brazil and international migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to North America are partly a consequence of prolonged droughts, which have increased the stress of food availability in these highly impoverished regions. Diminished access to water is also a result of privatisation of that resource. In CA, the majority of migrants are young men, reducing the labour force in their places of origin. However, the migrants send back substantial amounts of money, which have become the main source of foreign exchange for their countries and the main source of income for their families."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.3_p4,NO_TITLE,"Because poor people have fewer resources to adapt to changing conditions, they are usually the most impacted by climate hazards since they are already struggling to survive under normal conditions. These populations are the most likely to migrate, chiefly because of the loss of their livelihoods, their precarious housing and settlements and the lack of money and international aid. Other important factors are the minimal governmental support and assistance through social safety nets and extension services, the scarcity and low quality of education and health services, their isolation and marginality and the insecurity of land rights. These same conditions, though, may hinder their mobility or even render them immobile. Nevertheless, in some cases, despite worsening conditions, people decide not to move."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.3_p5,NO_TITLE,"The magnitude and frequency of droughts and hurricanes are projected to keep increasing by 2050, which may force millions of people to leave their homes. Climate models show some dry regions becoming even dryer in the coming decades, increasing the stress on small farmers who rely on rainfall to water their fields. Glacier retreat and water scarcity are becoming strong drivers of migration in the Andes. SLR affects activities such as fishing and tourism, which will foster further migration. In Brazil, at least 0.9 million more people will migrate interregionally under future climate conditions."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.3_p6,NO_TITLE,"Addressing migration and displacement requires diverse interventions: in dry regions it is recommended to improve water management in the places of origin of migration, including storage, distribution and irrigation. Wet regions, lowlands and floodplains will benefit from preventing construction in areas prone to landslides and flooding. Government and international aid are also important for improving people’s options to adapt and enhance their resilience to climate impacts. In northern Brazil, for example, government financial support has significantly reduced drought-related migration. There exists between Guatemala and Canada a temporary migration programme to bring in migrant workers during the harvest season. The United States is also increasing these types of legal temporary migration."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.4_p2,NO_TITLE,"Over the last two decades, countries throughout CSA have been developing rapidly. The agricultural sector is fundamental to this development from economic and social perspectives. Some countries in the region are major global food exporters:"
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.4_p4,NO_TITLE,"CSA is among the regions with the highest potential to increase food supplies, particularly to more densely populated regions in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. A better understanding of the impact of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy is critical for identifying opportunities for innovation and promoting activities that could lead to sustainable economic growth without depleting natural resources and increasing sensitivity to climate change and climate variability. The consideration of food as a commodity instead of a common resource leads to the accumulation of underpriced food resources at the expense of natural capital. Without serious emissions reduction measures, climate models project an average 1°C to 4°C increase in maximum temperatures and a 30% decrease in rainfall up to 2050, across CSA. Tropical SA is projected to warm at higher rates than the southern part of SA. Given these circumstances, some regions in CSA (Andes region and CA) will just meet or fall below the critical food supply/demand ratio for their population. Meanwhile, the temperate southern-most region of SA is projected to have agricultural production surplus. The challenge for this region will be to retain the ability to feed and adequately nourish its internal population as well as make an important contribution to food supplies available to the rest of the world."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.4_p5,NO_TITLE,"The NDCs of most CSA countries expressly include agriculture as a major component of their adaptive strategy. From the recommendations presented, five general adaptive themes, or imperatives, emerge: (a) inclusion of climate-change projections as a key element for ministries of agriculture and research institutes in their decision-making processes, (b) support of research on and adoption of drought- and heat-tolerant crop varieties, (c) promotion of sustainable irrigation as an effective adaptive strategy, (d) recovery of degraded lands and sustainable intensification of agriculture to prevent further deforestation, and (e) implementation of climate-smart practices and technologies to increase productivity while improving adaptability."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.4_p6,NO_TITLE,"Climate-smart practices provide a framework to operationalise actions aimed at understanding synergies among productivity, adaptation and mitigation. A significant amount of evidence supports the potential for climate-smart-practice technologies to produce such triple wins as natural pastoral systems in the southern region of SA. Such systems allow for the combination of food production and environmental sustainability. The production of meat based on native grasslands with grazing management that optimises forage allowance can achieve high production levels while providing multiple ecosystem benefits. Optimal forage allowance means offering animals enough forage in order to meet requirements while avoiding overgrazing. This management practice simultaneously increases productivity, reduces GHG emissions while improving soil carbon sequestration and minimises other environmental impacts such as excess of nutrients, fossil-based energy use and biodiversity loss. Pastoral farming systems that manage grazing and feeding efficiently are an example of the integration of food security, environmental conservation and nature-based adaptation to climate change."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.4_p7,NO_TITLE,"Agroforestry systems are present in the tropical region of CSA. Trees are present in a large part of the agricultural landscape of this region, either dispersed or in lines, supporting the production of coffee, cocoa, fruits, pastures and livestock in various agroforestry configurations. In CA, shade-grown coffee reduces weed control and improves the quality and taste of the product. Agroforestry uses nitrogen-fixing trees (Leguminosae), such as Leucaena in Colombia and Inga in Brazil, to restore soil nitrogen fertility. Tropical forest soils are generally nutrient-poor and unsuited to long-term agricultural use. Land converted to agriculture by cutting and burning natural vegetation tends to remain productive for only a few years. Agroforestry and so-called silvopastoral systems, which incorporate trees into crop and livestock systems, have been shown to have a dramatic impact on the maintenance and restoration of long-term productivity in agricultural landscapes, including degraded and abandoned land. Agroforestry systems can provide major benefits through enhanced food security, stronger local economies and increased ecosystem services such as carbon storage, regulation of climate and water cycles, control of pests and diseases and maintenance of soil fertility. Because of these multiple goods and services, agroforestry practices are considered one of the key strategies for the development of climate-smart agriculture."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p2,NO_TITLE,"There are 28 million Indigenous Peoples in CSA (around 6.6% of the total population of the region). They belong to more than 800 groups living in territories covering a wide range of ecosystems—from drylands to tropical rainforests to savannahs, coasts to mountains—and that share the land with many other cultural and ethnic groups. In the region, Indigenous Peoples are often categorised as groups that are highly vulnerable to climate change because they are frequently affected by socioeconomic inequalities and the dominance of external powers. They often experience internal and external pressures on their communal lands in the forms of pollution, oil and mining, industrial agriculture and urbanisation. On the other hand, it is important to recognise that Indigenous Peoples have knowledge systems and practices that allow them to adapt to many climatic changes. Increasing scientific evidence shows that adaptation initiatives based on Indigenous knowledge and practices are more sustainable and legitimate among local communities."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p3,NO_TITLE,"The wide range of adaptation practices based on IK in the region include, among others, increasing species and genetic diversity in agricultural systems through community seed exchanges; promotion of highly diverse crop systems; ancient systems to collect and conserve water; fire prevention strategies; observing and monitoring changes in communal ecological–agricultural calendar cycles; recognising changes in ecological indicators like migration patterns in birds, the behaviour of insects and other invertebrates and the phenology of fruit and flowering species; and systematisation and knowledge exchange among communities. These practices represent a valuable cultural and biological heritage."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p4,NO_TITLE,"The Kichwa in the Ecuadorian Amazon cultivate Chakras (plots) within the rainforest. These plots combine crops and medicinal herbs for both self-consumption and selling. Similar systems, like the Chakras in the high Andes, the Milpas in CA, and the Conucos in northern SA, have been resilient to social and environmental disturbances due to their outstanding agrobiodiversity (more than 40 species and varieties can be present in one plot), microhabitat management and the associated knowledge and institutions."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p5,NO_TITLE,"Traditional fire management among Indigenous Peoples of Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana is another adaptation strategy based on a fine-tuned understanding of environmental indicators associated with their culture and worldviews. In these countries, Indigenous lands have the lowest incidence of wildfires, significantly contributing to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity. These traditional practices have helped to prevent large-scale and destructive wildfires, reducing the risks posed by rising temperature and dryness due to climate change."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p6,NO_TITLE,"The traditional agriculture of Mapuche Indigenous Peoples in Chile includes a series of practices that result in a system that is more resilient to climate and non-climate stressors. Practices include water management, native seed conservation and exchange with other producers (trafkintu), crop rotation, polyculture and tree–crop association. Similar practices can be found in Mayan communities in Guatemala at the other end of the sub-continent."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p7,NO_TITLE,"Despite the increasing recognition and integration of IK in adaptation practices and policies in the region, important barriers for a more effective and transformative integration remain. Some of the most relevant barriers include limited participation of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in adaptation planning and the lack of sufficient consideration of non-climatic socioeconomic drivers of vulnerability such as poverty and inequality. Also, scientific knowledge is commonly prioritised over traditional IKLK. However, some transformative efforts are emerging. Bolivian Indigenous organisations represent a notable example by contesting normative conceptions of development as economic growth and replacing them with more comprehensive views like harmony with Mother Earth and ‘Sumak Kawsay’ or ‘Good Living’."
wg2_ch12_FAQ 12.5_p8,NO_TITLE,"Several strategies have been proposed to overcome existing barriers, including building effective and respectful partnerships among Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, co-producing climate-change-relevant knowledge and recognising Indigenous Peoples as active participants in the continual development of autonomous strategies to preserve their practices, beliefs and knowledge. The implementation of these and other strategies can significantly enhance adaptation planning and action in the region."
