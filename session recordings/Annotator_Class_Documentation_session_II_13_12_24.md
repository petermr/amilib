# Annotator Class Documentation

## Overview
The `Annotator` class is designed to annotate elements, such as HTML elements, with specific words or phrases. It encapsulates the logic for annotation, making the code more robust, modular, and easier to maintain.

---

## Class Definition

The `Annotator` class is structured to provide annotation capabilities. It includes an initializer (`__init__`) to store necessary attributes like a list of `words` used for annotation. It also provides methods to annotate elements and retrieve annotation details. The main attributes include `self.words`, which stores the list of words or phrases used for annotation, and constants such as `ANNOTATION_CONSTANT` for reusable values.

The initializer method accepts an optional list of words and sets it as the class attribute `self.words`. If no words are provided, it defaults to an empty list. Another key method, `annotate_element`, takes an element as input and modifies its text by wrapping the specified words in annotation tags. This allows for clear, consistent annotations in the element's content. Additionally, the method `get_annotation` retrieves annotation-related metadata or constants.

## Features

### Attributes
- **`self.words`**: This attribute stores the list of words or phrases used for annotation and is initialized through the constructor.

### Methods
- **`__init__`**: Initializes the class with an optional list of words. Defaults to an empty list if no words are provided.
- **`annotate_element`**: Annotates an input element with the stored words, replacing matching text with annotated versions.
- **`get_annotation`**: Retrieves annotation-related metadata or constants.

## Example Usage

To use the `Annotator` class, you first initialize it with a list of words or phrases to annotate. For example, you can create an instance with words like "carbon" and "cycle." Then, you can apply annotations to elements, such as paragraphs containing text. When an element is processed, the words are wrapped in annotation tags, making the content visually distinct and easier to identify.

Here is an illustrative example: An `Annotator` instance is created with words "carbon" and "cycle." A paragraph element with the text "The carbon cycle is essential" is passed to the annotator. The resulting annotated text becomes "The `<mark>carbon</mark>` `<mark>cycle</mark>` is essential," where `<mark>` tags denote the annotation. This process ensures consistent, reusable annotations across different elements.

---

## Testing

Testing the `Annotator` class involves creating test cases to verify its functionality. For instance, a test can be written to ensure that the words in the provided list are correctly annotated in an element's text. By using test frameworks like `unittest`, you can validate that annotations are applied as expected and that no unintended errors occur.

### Example Test

A test might initialize the class with words "carbon" and "cycle," and then pass a paragraph element to be annotated. The expected outcome would confirm that the annotated text includes the words wrapped in annotation tags, ensuring the functionality aligns with the requirements.

## Design Principles

### 1. **Encapsulation**
The `Annotator` class encapsulates annotation logic, isolating it from other parts of the code to ensure clarity and maintainability.

### 2. **Modularity**
By reducing dependencies and coupling, the class can be easily integrated or reused in various contexts without significant modifications.

### 3. **Extendability**
The class is designed to be extendable, allowing new methods or attributes to be added without disrupting its existing functionality.
