# Disambiguation Classifier - User Summary

## üéØ What This System Does

The **Disambiguation Classifier** automatically identifies which Wikipedia disambiguation options are most relevant to your specific subject area. Instead of manually reading through all options, it uses your existing **AmiDictionary** to score and rank them by relevance.

## üîç The Problem It Solves

When you search for terms like "GHG" on Wikipedia, you get multiple options:

- **Greenhouse gas** - A gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy
- **General Healthcare Group** - A British healthcare company  
- **George H. Goble** - Staff member at Purdue University
- **Gruppenhorchger√§t** - A hydrophone array used on Nazi U-boats
- **Marshfield Municipal Airport** - An airport in Massachusetts

**Without classification**: You have to read through all 5 options to find the climate-related one.

**With classification**: The system automatically identifies "Greenhouse gas" as highly relevant to climate topics.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### **Step 1: Your Dictionary Provides the Vocabulary**
The system uses your **AmiDictionary** entries as the source of relevant terms:

```python
# Your climate dictionary contains:
- "climate change"
- "greenhouse gas" 
- "carbon dioxide"
- "emissions"
- "temperature"
# ... and many more climate-related terms
```

### **Step 2: Automatic Scoring**
For each disambiguation option, the system:

1. **Extracts the text** (e.g., "Greenhouse gas, a gas that absorbs...")
2. **Checks for matches** against your dictionary terms
3. **Scores the relevance** based on matches found
4. **Ranks the options** from most to least relevant

### **Step 3: Smart Classification**
Options are automatically classified as:

- **üü¢ Highly Relevant** - Multiple dictionary term matches
- **üü° Moderately Relevant** - Some dictionary term matches  
- **üî¥ Not Relevant** - No dictionary term matches

## üìä Example Results

Using a climate-focused dictionary, here's how "GHG" disambiguation would be classified:

| **Option** | **Dictionary Matches** | **Score** | **Classification** |
|------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Greenhouse gas** | ["greenhouse gas", "gas", "absorbs", "emits"] | **8.5** | üü¢ Highly Relevant |
| General Healthcare Group | [] | **0.0** | üî¥ Not Relevant |
| George H. Goble | [] | **0.0** | üî¥ Not Relevant |
| Gruppenhorchger√§t | [] | **0.0** | üî¥ Not Relevant |
| Marshfield Municipal Airport | [] | **0.0** | üî¥ Not Relevant |

## üöÄ How to Use It

### **Basic Usage**

```python
from amilib.ami_dict import AmiDictionary
from amilib.disambiguation_classifier import DisambiguationClassifier

# Load your dictionary
climate_dict = AmiDictionary.create_from_xml_file("climate_dictionary.xml")

# Create classifier
classifier = DisambiguationClassifier(climate_dict)

# Classify disambiguation options
disambiguation_options = wikipedia_page.get_disambiguation_list()
classified_results = classifier.classify_options(disambiguation_options)

# Get the most relevant option
best_option = classified_results[0]
print(f"Most relevant: {best_option['text']}")
print(f"Relevance score: {best_option['score']}")
```

### **Advanced Usage with Custom Weights**

```python
# Configure classification for your domain
config = {
    'term_weight': 0.6,        # How much to weight exact term matches
    'description_weight': 0.3,  # How much to weight description text
    'synonym_weight': 0.1,     # How much to weight synonyms
    'threshold_high': 5.0,     # Score needed for "highly relevant"
    'threshold_moderate': 2.0  # Score needed for "moderately relevant"
}

classifier = DisambiguationClassifier(climate_dict, config=config)
```

## üé® Customization Options

### **1. Domain-Specific Dictionaries**
Create different dictionaries for different subject areas:

- **Climate Science**: `climate_dictionary.xml`
- **Healthcare**: `healthcare_dictionary.xml`  
- **Technology**: `tech_dictionary.xml`
- **Finance**: `finance_dictionary.xml`

### **2. Scoring Adjustments**
Fine-tune how the system weights different types of matches:

```python
# Example: Healthcare domain might weight descriptions more heavily
healthcare_config = {
    'term_weight': 0.5,        # Lower weight for terms
    'description_weight': 0.4,  # Higher weight for descriptions
    'synonym_weight': 0.1      # Same weight for synonyms
}
```

### **3. Threshold Customization**
Adjust what scores qualify as "relevant":

```python
# For strict classification (fewer false positives)
strict_config = {
    'threshold_high': 7.0,      # Higher bar for "highly relevant"
    'threshold_moderate': 4.0   # Higher bar for "moderately relevant"
}

# For lenient classification (more potential matches)
lenient_config = {
    'threshold_high': 3.0,      # Lower bar for "highly relevant"
    'threshold_moderate': 1.0   # Lower bar for "moderately relevant"
}
```

## üîß Technical Details

### **What Gets Scored**

1. **Exact Term Matches**: Dictionary terms found in disambiguation text
2. **Description Content**: Text from dictionary entry descriptions
3. **Synonyms**: Alternative terms for dictionary entries
4. **Partial Matches**: Substrings and related terms

### **Scoring Algorithm**

```
Total Score = (Term Matches √ó 0.6) + (Description Matches √ó 0.3) + (Synonym Matches √ó 0.1)
```
