# BioRxiv Climate Annotation Demo Project

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive demo of search and annotation capabilities for BioRxiv, showcasing climate science document analysis with potential integration into BioRxiv's platform.

## Project Scope

### **Core Functionality**
1. **BioRxiv Search Integration**
   - Submit climate-related queries to BioRxiv
   - Handle paginated HTML results with cursor navigation
   - Process search result metadata

2. **Document Retrieval**
   - Retrieve PDF and HTML versions of search hits
   - Handle human-downloadable content (machine download protection)
   - Negotiate machine access solutions (API keys, IP whitelisting)

3. **Climate Annotation System**
   - Annotate documents with IPCC climate glossary (900+ terms)
   - Support both PDF and HTML annotation
   - Generate comprehensive annotation reports

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Term frequency analysis and statistics
   - Co-occurrence matrix generation
   - Document clustering by term similarity
   - Relevance scoring and ranking

## Technical Architecture

### **Search & Retrieval Layer**
```
BioRxiv API/Web → Search Results → Document Retrieval → Local Storage
```

### **Annotation Pipeline**
```
Documents → Climate Glossary → Annotation Engine → Annotated Output
```

### **Analytics Engine**
```
Annotated Documents → Term Analysis → Co-occurrence → Clustering → Reports
```
