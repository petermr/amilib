# CSS Replacement Test Results (Final)

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Branch**: pmr_202507

## Final Outcome
- All tests for the new `CSSStyleWrapper` (cssutils-based) pass.
- The wrapper is fully compatible with the current `CSSStyle` API and formatting.
- Edge cases and all usage patterns are covered by the test suite.
- The wrapper is ready for integration into the main codebase.

## Next Steps
- Integrate the wrapper into `ami_html.py` as the new `CSSStyle`.
- Optionally keep the legacy code as `CSSStyleLegacy` for a transition period.
- Run the full amilib test suite after integration.
- Remove legacy code after successful migration.
