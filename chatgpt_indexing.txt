Creating a semantic index for a static corpus of HTML pages involves several steps, including data extraction, text processing, and indexing. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using open-source tools:

Step 1: Data Extraction
HTML Parsing:
Use libraries like Beautiful Soup (Python) to extract text from HTML files.
python
Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os

corpus = []
for filename in os.listdir('path/to/html/files'):
    with open(os.path.join('path/to/html/files', filename)) as f:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(f, 'html.parser')
        corpus.append(soup.get_text())
Step 2: Text Processing
Text Cleaning:

Clean the extracted text to remove unnecessary whitespace, special characters, etc.
python
Copy code
import re

cleaned_corpus = [re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip() for text in corpus]
Tokenization:

Use libraries like NLTK or spaCy to tokenize the text and perform further processing like stemming or lemmatization.
python
Copy code
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')

tokenized_corpus = [word_tokenize(text) for text in cleaned_corpus]
Step 3: Semantic Representation
Word Embeddings:

Use Gensim or FastText to create word embeddings from the processed text.
python
Copy code
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

model = Word2Vec(tokenized_corpus, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
Document Embeddings:

You can also use Doc2Vec for representing entire documents.
python
Copy code
from gensim.models import Doc2Vec

documents = [TaggedDocument(doc, [i]) for i, doc in enumerate(tokenized_corpus)]
doc_model = Doc2Vec(documents, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
Step 4: Indexing
Use Elasticsearch:

Set up Elasticsearch for indexing your documents. You can install it locally or use Docker.
bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:7.10.1
Indexing Documents:

Use the Elasticsearch client for Python (elasticsearch-py) to index your cleaned documents.
python
Copy code
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch()

for i, doc in enumerate(cleaned_corpus):
    es.index(index='html_corpus', id=i, body={'text': doc})
Step 5: Querying
Semantic Search:

Use vector embeddings to perform semantic searches against your indexed documents. You can compute the similarity of query embeddings against document embeddings and retrieve the closest matches.
Elasticsearch Vector Queries:

For more advanced querying, you might want to use Elasticsearch's vector search capabilities with dense vector fields.
Step 6: Interface (Optional)
Create a Search Interface:
Consider using a web framework like Flask or Django to create a simple user interface for querying the indexed data.
Tools Summary
Data Extraction: Beautiful Soup
Text Processing: NLTK, spaCy, Gensim
Semantic Indexing: Elasticsearch
Optional Interface: Flask or Django
Conclusion
This approach will allow you to create a semantic index on your static HTML corpus. Adjust parameters and methods based on your specific needs and data characteristics. Good luck with your project!
