**Introduction:**

This chapter analyzes about how the human activities have affected the climate and how the climate models developed accurately stimulate the observed changes and variations. This chapter combines techniques for identifying and linking climate change, emphasizing its long-term and widespread effects. It evaluates the impact of humans on the atmosphere, cryosphere, seas, and biosphere, among other climatic components.

**Methods:**

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) and the NCAR Climate Variability Diagnostic Package (CVDP), which provide thorough and quality-controlled assessments of climate models, are two examples of sophisticated approaches for model evaluation used in this chapter. Regression-based techniques, also known as fingerprinting techniques, are employed to identify and link several external factors to climate change. These techniques were first used to measure the global surface temperature, but they are now applicable to other climatic variables at various scales. They compare observed changes to predicted patterns, or fingerprints, from climate models using multivariate linear regression.

**Influence on Atmosphere and Surface:**

The Hadley and Walker circulations are part of the tropical troposphere, and the extent of the tropics is indicated by the downwelling branch of the Hadley cell in the subtropics. The Maritime continent is the primary rising branch of the Walker circulation, with supplementary ascents occurring across northern South America and Africa. Seasonal changes in air circulation and precipitation associated with moisture redistribution and the annual solar cycle are represented by monsoons.

**Influence on Cryosphere:**

Since 1950, there has been a noticeable decline in the amount of snow cover in the spring in the Northern Hemisphere, which is most likely due to human activity. Compared to CMIP5 models, CMIP6 models better capture the seasonality and distribution of snow cover; significant decreases in spring snow cover are seen in both model versions, which is more consistent with current observations. CMIP6 models do not, however, significantly improve on problems with vegetation-snow interactions that plagued CMIP5 models.

**Influence on Ocean:**

As the global ocean moves and stores large amounts of heat, freshwater, and carbon and exchanges them with the atmosphere, it is essential to the functioning of the climate system. In order to understand the implications of human warming, including warming rates, sea level rise, and carbon uptake, accurate ocean simulation in climate models is essential. Important metrics for assessing climate models and tracking changes in ocean climate are temperature and heat content of the ocean.

**Influence on Biosphere:**

Globally averaged land carbon sinks are accurately simulated by Earth system models, however there are notable regional differences. Though this is somewhat compensated by other causes, new research indicates that CO2 fertilization is the primary cause of the increasing amplitude of the atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle. Although the observed greening trend is thought to be primarily caused by CO2 fertilization, there is little confidence in this theory due to the lack of models that fully account for all key processes and the continuous dispute on the roles of CO2 fertilization, high-latitude warming, and land management.

**Conclusion:**

The evidence supporting the theory concludes that the people are driving climate change has grown over time. The Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, published in 1995, indicated that there was evidence of human influence on the climate. Further reports from 2001, 2007 and 2013 discovered even more convincing data. It was evident by the Fifth Assessment Report (2013) that human activities, such as the increase in greenhouse gases, were having an impact on the climate.
